# CNeutral
 
This repository contains multiple projects that I worked on while interning at CNeutral. Some of the projects contain
finished modules that can be imported while others are partially done or simply code for a single process. Some of the 
packages or modules might not be organized completely and some irrelevant files might exist. All code should still be
commented and documented well enough for a casual programmer to understand.

NOTE: All folders in this repo should also contain README.md files explaining that module in more detail.

NOTE 2: I do know how to use branching in GIT. This repo is simply used as a storage and display of the projects. Version
control of each project is done on its own branch that is private. This repo should be updated regularly to contain the
latest updates.
