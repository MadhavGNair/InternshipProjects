# CNeutral
 
This repository contains multiple projects that I worked on while interning at CNeutral. Some of the projects contain
finished modules that can be imported while others are partially done or simply code for a single process. Some of the 
packages or modules might not be organized completely and some irrelevant files might exist. All code should still be
commented and documented well enough for a casual programmer to understand.

NOTE: All folders in this repo should also contain README.md files explaining that module in more detail.
