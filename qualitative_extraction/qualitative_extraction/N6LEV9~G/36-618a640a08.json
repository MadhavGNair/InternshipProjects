The D&I council chairperson is the head of diversity and inclusion and the members include human resources, \nexecutives, chairs of our affinity network groups (ANGs) and regional representatives located at our global sites. Our ANGs play an integral \npart in the work we do around D&I and include the following groups: Black Employee Network (B.E.N.), Cultivate, Employee Activity \nCommittee, STEM UP (science, technology, engineering and math for under-represented populations), Women\u2019s Leadership Initiative and \nnewly formed in 2020, Continua and Veteran and Military Employees (VME). These groups help facilitate networking, mentoring, cultural \nawareness, recruitment, employee development and retention, along with increased collaboration and innovation, and service learning. \nCharters for the ANGs align seamlessly with our core values and diversity and inclusion framework. \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022Women\u2019s Leadership Initiative (WLI)\ngroup launched\nAffinity Network Groups (ANGs)\nlaunched\nDiversity metrics added to corporate bonus plan\nD&I Benchmarking \u2013 Integrated Plan (roadmap)\nestablished\nDiverse candidate pool and interview panel\nConducted US pay equity assessment\u2022\n\u2022Diversity and Inclusion Council launched\nD&I Vision, Mission and Framework established\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022Head of Diversity and Inclusion hired\nD&I incorporated into succession planning process\nD&I training added to L&D leadership pathways\nmodel\nMentorship program for Senior Female Leaders\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022U.S. paternal leave policy launched\nFormalized global human rights policy\nConducted global pay equity assessment\nDiversity indexes2020201820162014\n201920172015\n\u2022Included on Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index\nDiversity and Inclusion\nGovernance Structure\nPresident/ CEO Board of Directors\nDiversity & Inclusion\nOrganizationDiversity & Inclusion\nCouncil\nAffinity Network Groups\nB.E.N.
