For this \nreason, ON Semiconductor does not make political contributions to individual candidates. In the U.S., companies and other organizations \nmay organize political action committees (PACs) to support political candidates with funds voluntarily contributed by qualified employees. \nWe chose not to have a PAC and did not make any political contributions in our company\u2019s name in 2019.\nPrivacy\nIn 2019, we prepared for the arrival of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on Jan. 1, 2020. The CCPA mirrors, in \nmany respects, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, which came into effect in May 2018. \nWe also continued to refine our internal and external privacy \npolicies and expanded our training efforts to focus \non functional teams most directly impacted by the \nregulatory changes in this area, including information \ntechnology, finance, human resources, procurement \nand legal. In addition, BELs attended a live training \nsession dedicated to the GDPR and the CCPA privacy \nregimes.  For more information, please visit our \nPrivacy Policy . \n",
