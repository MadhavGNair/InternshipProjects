Along with our products, which help to reduce energy consumption, \nwe regularly implement energy conservation and consolidation projects. Our total energy consumption was 1,747,719,766 (kWh), with \nelectrical and fuel consumption (from non-renewable resources) being 846,912 gigajoules. We saw a rise in electricity consumption \nnormalized units (photo-moves for wafer fab operations, kWbonds for assembly and test operations) in 2019 due to a decrease in these \nvolumes, which negatively affected our performance.\nCurrent Practice\nOur manufacturing site in Suzhou, China focused on an energy conservation project in 2019. Suzhou \nreduced energy demand through operations focusing on actual terminal demand and seasonal temperature. \nEnergy reduction through actual terminal demand was achieved by \npowering off idle machines, adjusting running quantity, loading rates \nand optimizing the parameter. The total annual savings for this \nproject is over $185,000, more than 32% of their original goal.\nElectricity Consumption at  \nWafer Fab Operations  \n[kWh/Unit] \u2013 Normalized ValuesElectricity Consumption at  \nAssembly and Test Operations  \n[g CE/Unit] \u2013 Normalized Values\n0.000.020.040.060.08\n1.301.351.401.451.501.551.600.069 0.065 0.057 0.060 0.068\nBaseline\n20152016 2017 2018 2019\n2020 Target\n1.555\n1.458\n1.3861.4211.500\nBaseline\n20152016 2017 2018 2019\n2020 Target0.000.020.040.060.08\n1.301.351.401.451.501.551.600.069 0.065 0.057 0.060 0.068\nBaseline\n20152016 2017 2018 2019\n2020 Target\n1.555\n1.458\n1.3861.4211.500\nBaseline\n20152016 2017 2018 2019\n2020 Target", "metadata": {"source": "N6LEV9~G.pdf", "page": 54, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
