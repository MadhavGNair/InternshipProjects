For example, in January 2022, \nApple, along with other leading companies, \nfiled an amicus brief in support of the EPA\u2019s \nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \nbecause that authority \u201cis critical to combatting \nclimate change.\u201d\nIn November 2021, Apple filed a lawsuit against \nNSO Group and its parent company to hold it \naccountable for the surveillance and targeting \nof Apple users. The complaint provides new \ninformation on how NSO Group infected victims\u2019 \ndevices with its Pegasus spyware. To prevent \nfurther abuse and harm to its users, Apple is \nseeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO \nGroup from using any Apple software, services, \nor devices. \nApple\u2019s Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, Lisa Jackson, alongside President Joe Biden \nand other leaders from around the world at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

And at \nthe 26th UN Climate Change Conference of \nthe Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, \nin 2021, Apple called for bold government \naction on climate change, joining several new \ninitiatives, including the First Movers Coalition, \nthe Forest Investor Club, and the Clean Energy \nDemand Initiative.\nWe also advocate for country-specific measures \nthat motivate climate action. For example, \nwe\u2019ve called for enhanced climate ambition \nand renewable energy deployment in Japan\u2019s \nBasic Energy Plan and Nationally Determined \nContribution (Japan\u2019s plan to reduce emissions \nin furtherance of the Paris Agreement), and for \nAdvocating for change\nApple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   9\nAppendix\nGovernance\nCommunities\nSuppliers\nCustomers\nOur People\nEnvironment\nIntroduction \n",

About 1.5 \ngigawatts of Apple-created renewable \nelectricity projects account for over 90 percent \nof the renewable electricity our facilities use.\nWe continue to experience tremendous \nprogress toward our goal of transitioning our \nmanufacturing supply chain to 100 percent \nrenewable electricity by 2030. As of March \n2022, 213 manufacturing partners in 25 \ncountries have committed to 100 percent \nrenewable energy for Apple production.\nOver 70 percent of companies on Apple\u2019s \nSupplier List \u2014 those suppliers that make \nup 98 percent of Apple\u2019s direct spend for \nmaterials, manufacturing, and assembly of \nour products worldwide \u2014 have committed to \n100 percent renewable electricity. In addition, \nmany other smaller suppliers have also made \nthese commitments.\nDirect emissions abatement\nTo address the non-electricity emissions \nassociated with our materials and \nmanufacturing processes, we seek \ntechnological solutions through emissions \nabatement or switching to low-carbon fuel \noptions. For example, we partnered with \naluminum companies and the governments \nof Canada and Quebec to help fund research \nand development for ELYSIS, a technology that \neliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom aluminum smelting.\nMany components essential to products like \nours, including integrated circuit chips and \ndisplay panels, currently rely on manufacturing \nprocesses that use fluorinated gases, which \nhave high global warming potential. We\u2019re \npartnering closely with key manufacturers \nto prevent these gases from being \nreleased into the atmosphere by optimizing \nmanufacturing processes and deploying \nabatement technologies.\nTo address emissions from shipping products \nto our customers, we\u2019re shifting whenever \npossible toward less carbon-intensive shipping \nmodes, such as rail and ocean. And we\u2019re \nseeking out technical innovations, including \nalternative fuels and electric vehicles. In fiscal \nyear 2021, Apple avoided 180,000 metric tons \nof CO2e by shifting the mode of transport and \nreducing product weight through the removal  \nof the power adapter from the box of \niPhone devices. \nProviding access to clean energy in South Africa \nEven a few years ago, not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricity  \nat home. Many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costs \nand other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach. As we worked with our \npartners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program,  \nwe saw exciting potential in this community. \nOur partner on the ground, DC GO, a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg,  \ngot to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs. \nUltimately, DC GO developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to 3500 \nhomes that previously lacked access. This was possible only because of the way they  \nbuilt relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solution  \nin line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns.\nIn addition, DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales, maintenance,  \nand other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project \n \u2014 and the community\u2019s access to electricity \u2014 would be sustainable over time.  \nThis is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit \ncommunities, our company, and the environment at the same time.

Apple will invest up to \n$200 million in projects that aim to remove \ncarbon from the atmosphere and store it, all \nwhile meeting clear social and environmental \nimpact criteria and offering a financial return.  \nIn its pilot phase, the Restore Fund has a goal  \nof removing at least 1 million metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide per year.\nFor more information on our efforts to combat \nclimate change and reach our 2030 carbon \nneutral goal, read our 2022 Environmental \nProgress Report.\nClimate scenario analysis \nIn 2020, we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and \ntransition effects of climate change. To align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2\u00b0C. \nAnd we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities. The \nanalysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our \ncorporate resiliency. It also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies, \nincluding considerations around supply chain diversification, as well as safeguarding our global assets.\nWe\u2019re committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change.  \nFor more information on these climate-related risks and Apple\u2019s governance of these risks, read our  \n2021 CDP submission (PDF).\nAs the Restore Fund projects come online, we\u2019ve partnered with Conservation International to \ndevelop and invest in nature-based carbon removal projects. This includes a project to protect  \nand restore 27,000 acres of mangrove forests in Colombia.\nAs the projects in the Restore Fund come \nonline, we\u2019re also working to address difficult-\nto-avoid emissions in the short term. In fiscal \nyear 2021, 167,000 metric tons of carbon \ncredits were retired from the Chyulu Hills \nproject in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality \nfor our corporate emissions in fiscal year \n2021. And we purchased carbon credits from \ntwo additional projects to offset a total of \n500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across \nour value chain: a REDD+ coastal conservation \nproject in Guatemala and a reforestation project \nin Guizhou Province of China.

Part of Apple\u2019s \nRacial Equity and Justice Initiative (see page 60), the Accelerator aims to help combat \nsystemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities \nmost impacted by climate change. \nWe selected our first class of 15 businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and \nclean energy to begin the program in August 2021. The three-month program included live \nvirtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financial \nand legal subjects, as well as one-on-one mentorship with an Apple expert on topics from \nrenewable energy to responsible sourcing.\nThe goal of the Impact Accelerator is to better position the participating companies for \ngrowth, to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts, and to expand their customer \nbase \u2014 all while fostering their environmental commitment. For example, last October we \nannounced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six \nSioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to create  \na wind power development in the Midwest.

These and other innovations helped \nus increase our use of recycled or renewable \ncontent to 18 percent of all the material shipped \nin products in fiscal year 2021.7\nProduct longevity\nWe want to make the most of the materials we \nuse through designing long-lasting products. \nWe are designing durable hardware, leveraging \nsoftware updates to extend functionality, \nexpanding access to repair services, \nrefurbishing devices for their next user, and \nreusing parts that still have more to give. Read \nmore on caring for customers on page 56. \nProduct end-of-life \nBy effectively recovering the materials in our \nproducts, we enable the circular supply chains \nthat make the best use of finite resources. \nThrough our work in this area, we\u2019re reducing \nthe need to mine new materials and the \namount of energy needed to manufacture new \nproducts, ultimately driving down emissions \nand conserving resources.\nIn 99 percent of the countries where we \nsell products, we continue to provide and \nparticipate in product take-back and recycling \ncollection programs. With the help of \ncustomer and employee participation across \nrecycling programs, we directed more than \n38,000 metric tons of e-waste to recycling \nglobally in fiscal year 2021.\nWe\u2019ve also continued to innovate on \ndisassembly technologies. Daisy, the robot we \ndesigned to disassemble iPhone devices, has \nnow been joined by Dave, which dismantles \nTaptic Engines from iPhone to enable the \nrecovery of materials like rare earth elements, \ntungsten, and steel, and Taz, designed to \nrecycle modules containing rare earth magnets. \nAt our Material Recovery Lab we\u2019re working \non developing better, more efficient means of \ndisassembling products that maximize material \nrecovery, while minimizing waste.\nWater stewardship\nWe\u2019re committed to managing the resources  \nwe share with the communities where we and \nour suppliers operate. Our efforts to address \nthe water footprint of our corporate sites and  \nof our suppliers\u2019 sites focus on:\n\u2022\t Using water efficiently\n\u2022\t Expanding the use of alternative water \nsources, including onsite reuse\n\u2022\t Discharging water responsibly\n\u2022\t Enhancing our water stewardship to keep \nwatersheds healthy for all who rely on them\nIn fiscal year 2021, our facilities used about \n1.4 billion gallons of water. We saved 133 million \ngallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to \nefficiency projects implemented since 2017.9 \nLast year, alternative water sources accounted \nfor 10 percent of our total corporate water usage \n\u2014 primarily from recycled water sources.10\nOur supply chain accounts for 99 percent of \nour total water footprint, based on our detailed \nwater inventory. That\u2019s why we partner closely \nwith our suppliers through our Clean Water \nProgram. The more than 195 participating \nsupplier sites increased their average reuse \nrate to 41 percent and saved our suppliers \n12.3 billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year \n2021 \u2014 for a total of 50.3 billion gallons of \nwater savings since the program\u2019s launch \nin\u00a02013.11\nInnovating packaging to reduce our footprint\nWe\u2019ve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by 2025. \nThis past year, plastics accounted for only 4 percent of our packaging. Since 2015, we\u2019ve \ndedicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays, wraps, and foam cushioning with fiber \nalternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints. \nThis year, the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro were the first iPhone models to be shipped \nwithout any plastic packaging components.8 And we replaced plastic foam with a fiber \nalternative to protect the 24-inch iMac during shipping.\nFor the 24-inch iMac, using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption  \nallowed us to reduce plastic by 72 percent.\nAppendix\nGovernance\nCommunities\nSuppliers\nCustomers\nOur People\nEnvironment\nIntroduction \nApple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   19\n",

In \n2021, 150,000 employees were eligible for \nRSU grants and our Compensation Committee \napproved grants for 99% of those eligible. \nIn most countries, employees also get discounts \nwhen purchasing Apple stock by participating \nin the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). \nCurrently, 81 percent of eligible employees \nparticipate in the ESPP.\nESG Modifier\nBeginning in 2021, the Compensation \nCommittee incorporated the ESG Modifier \ninto the Executive annual cash incentive \nprogram.

Approximately \n6 percent of our U.S. corporate workforce \nwere temporary workers as of October 2021. \nTemporary workers have the same opportunity \nto be considered as all other applicants to any \nApple job posting whether that opportunity is \na conversion of their current role or a role they \nfound on our job site. And in our retail business, \nwe have a strong record of hiring temporary \nworkers as full- and part-time employees. \nOur outsourced services with workers provided \nvia vendors generally perform work that can be \ndifferent from that performed by our permanent \nemployees. This workforce is intended to \nsupport business needs where specific skills \nare required and the vendors have the ability  \nto scale with our varied business needs.\nPay and benefits: For vendor services, pay \nrates are managed by the vendor.

We also \nmatched employee donations two-to-one to \nsupport COVID-19 response efforts worldwide. \nWe awarded $10 million from our Advanced \nManufacturing Fund to COPAN diagnostics, \na market leader in sample collection kits, \nthat rapidly accelerated their ability to supply \nsample collection kits to hospitals in the U.S. \nfor COVID-19 testing. And our partnership \nwith Product (RED) also supported COVID-19 \nresponse (see page 65).\nCollaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure they\u2019re taking every necessary \nprecaution to keep people safe at work. \nIn partnership with the White House \nCoronavirus Task Force and the CDC, we \nreleased an app and a website that guided \nAmericans through a series of questions about \ntheir health and exposure to determine if they \nshould seek care for COVID-19 symptoms, \nproviding CDC recommendations on next \nsteps, including guidance on social distancing \nand self\u2011isolating, how to closely monitor \nsymptoms, recommendations on testing, \nand when to contact a medical provider. \nAnd we collaborated with Google to create a \nnew exposure notification system for global \ngovernments and health agencies, with user \nprivacy and security central to its design, to \nhelp fight the pandemic.\nAppendix\nGovernance\nCommunities\nSuppliers\nCustomers\nOur People\nEnvironment\nIntroduction \nApple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   32\n",

        "text": "Health and safety at Apple \nWe\u2019re dedicated to protecting our team \nmembers and our customers everywhere \nwe operate \u2014 a responsibility COVID-19 has \nbrought into even greater focus. At every \nstage of the pandemic, we\u2019ve made decisions \nbased on the latest local data and public health \nguidance, and we share lessons across our \nEnvironment, Health, and Safety (EHS) teams \nglobally so we can continuously improve our \nsafety programs. \nProtecting our people \nWe\u2019re always working hard to make sure our \nworkers are safe no matter where they are \nwhen they\u2019re conducting business for Apple. \nWe abide by EHS requirements in every country \nwhere we operate and are dedicated to doing \neverything we can to support the safety and \nwell-being of our global teams. \nManaging work-related hazards and risks \nTo help ensure the safety of our workers and \ncustomers, we put procedures in place to \nidentify workplace risks and mitigate possible \nhazards. We support and protect employees \nin lower hazard spaces, and we put risk-\nspecific programs in place for those working \nin higher hazard environments, including safe \nsystems of work, chemical management, \nlaser safety, equipment and machinery safety, \nhazardous materials management, and \nelectrical safety. Employees can request to \nhave their workspaces individually inspected \nto review hazards and controls, including \nergonomics evaluations. \nApple implements a hierarchy of control \nfor significant risks, which centers on \nelimination, substitution, engineering controls, \nadministrative controls, and personal protective \nequipment (PPE).\nAs one example, Apple EHS regularly assesses \nhazards at our research labs based on their \nchemical, equipment, laser, and other hazards. \nApproximately 9 percent of our labs are \nconsidered \u201ccomplex,\u201d meaning that they \ncontain high-hazard processes and equipment. \nThese assessments help teams understand \nwhich EHS programs and controls must be \nput in place to mitigate risks. In 2021, Apple \ncompleted hazard assessments in over 2500 \nresearch labs globally.\nOur EHS teams identify and provide team \nmembers with appropriate PPE for specific \nhazards. This PPE is provided at no cost and \nwith training on correct use. For example, \nour hearing conservation programs include \nevaluation and control of occupational \nexposures to noise, and hearing protection is \navailable for processes, areas, and tasks with \npotential high noise exposures. Additionally, \nEHS conducts mandatory health checks for \nemployees where they\u2019re needed.\nWe invest in new technologies as we continue \nto manage potential risks across our operations, \nincluding our Apple-owned manufacturing \nsites. Our standards, programs, trainings, \nprocedures, and other safeguards are managed \nby trained EHS professionals, and where \nrequired, we also translate EHS procedures into \nlocal languages for our team members. \nRisks identified from incidents, injuries, and \nnon-routine events are addressed expeditiously \nto identify and implement appropriate \ncorrective and preventative actions, and we \nintegrate our learnings into future program \ndevelopment and training. Lessons learned \nare routinely communicated across Apple\u2019s \nEHS team and potentially affected operations, \nand they are used to inform updates to existing \npolicies and procedures.\nEmployees and managers can report incidents, \nnear-misses, and observations \u2014 including \nnewly identified hazards and risks\u2014through \nan internal iOS app. Incident responses are \naddressed by Apple\u2019s EHS team through a \nconsistent process that connects employees \nwith care and support, while identifying \ncorrective actions where appropriate to prevent \nfuture occurrences. \nWaste management\nApple is committed to minimizing resource \nuse and the associated generation of non-\nhazardous or hazardous waste. Where \npossible, Apple implements a waste hierarchy \nof prevention, waste reduction at the source, \nreuse of materials, recycling, energy recovery, \nand landfilling as a last resort.\nWe maintain our commitment to the safe and \nresponsible management of hazardous waste, \nboth onsite and offsite. Any facility that does \nnot meet our requirements is replaced by \nanother approved waste management facility.\nWe made progress in 2021 at sites around \nthe world:\nU.S.: Thirteen of the Treatment, Storage, and \nDisposal Facilities (TSDFs) we utilize in the U.S. \nwere audited in 2021 to confirm that the waste \nis treated, recycled, or incinerated within the \ngoverning safety standards for health and the \nenvironment. Eight disposal facility reviews \nwere completed by vendors under Apple \nmanagement, and we reviewed five other sites \nvia third-party audit reports. At one of our major \nresearch labs in Santa Clara Valley, the empty \ncontainer management program resulted in a \n3 percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous \nwaste streams.\nUnited Kingdom: Through an internal initiative \nto further strengthen waste management, \nproduct site-specific waste initiatives \nachieved a 97 percent diversion from landfill \nand a 0.4 tonnes of waste/1002, both \nexceeding requirements.\nIreland: The Cork Campus is ECVP 2799 Zero \nWaste to Landfill Certified annually and has had \nno material landfilled in the past five years.\nErgonomics\nIn 2021, we continued to support our global \nteam members working from home office, \nApple office, and non-office settings. \nThe Apple ergonomics program is heavily \nfocused on preventative measures to reduce \nthe risk of work-related musculoskeletal \ndisorders (WMSDs). This includes ergonomics \ntraining sessions for our team members and \nproviding input into the purchase or design \nof work equipment, systems, and facilities to \nensure that they meet ergonomic standards to \nprovide the best levels of efficiency, comfort, \nhealth, and safety for anyone using them.

Support \nincluded tailored guidance and feedback, \nequipment recommendations, and 1:1 virtual \nor in-person assessments. In addition, over \n3000 employees participated in various \ntraining sessions. \nOur industrial, warehouse, and other non-\noffice operations teams were supported with \napproximately 400 ergonomic risk assessments \nand 76 lab screenings. The assessments \nevaluated risk factors such as repetition, \nforce, posture, and duration, while reviewing \nthe interaction of the team member with \nnew machines, equipment, work processes, \nand workspaces.\nEmergency preparedness and response \nBeyond COVID-19, we supported the response \nto dozens of crisis events in 2021, including \nfires, severe weather, and civil unrest. Our \nresponses focused on the safety of our \nemployees and business continuity. We \nactivated 31 crisis management teams (CMTs) \nto manage the most severe events, and 120 \nadditional incidents were supported without \nfull CMTs.\nAll team members can sign up for Apple\u2019s \nEmergency Alert system, enabling them to be \nnotified of local emergencies and to indicate \nwhether they are safe or need help. Disaster \nsupplies are available at our facilities. All Apple \ncampuses with over 1000 employees have \nFacility Response and Recovery Plans, which \nprovide a comprehensive approach to the safety \nand support of our employees while minimizing \nbusiness interruption. Site-specific Emergency \nResponse Plans have been implemented \nglobally. These plans are communicated to all \nemployees, and trainings and drills are held at \nleast annually. And our employees are trained \nin emergency response, allowing them to react \nquickly while supporting the safety of our team \nmembers and customers. \nIn 2021, we completed over 200 emergency \nresponse drills, which were supported by \n2700 trained Emergency Response Team \n(ERT) members. We expect to increase the \nfrequency of these drills, depending on \nCOVID-19 restrictions. \nWith the care and support of our employees \nand customers in mind, we deployed Automatic \nExternal Defibrillator (AED) stations across \nour global retail stores in 2021. And to ensure \nthat our team members could effectively use \nthis new tool, we provided AED training for our \nteam members.\nAll campuses and key sites have disaster supplies \nto match localized risks. As Apple\u2019s footprint \ngrows, sites are evaluated and supplies are \nadded as needed. As one example, in 2021, we \nlaunched earthquake preparedness campaigns \nfor employees across the western United States \nand Japan. We conducted outreach to provide \nemployees with information, tools, and resources, \nand we held drills in some offices.\nWe\u2019re always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when \nthey\u2019re conducting business for Apple. \nAppendix\nGovernance\nCommunities\nSuppliers\nCustomers\nOur People\nEnvironment\nIntroduction \nApple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   34\n",

Our \ncommitment to protecting the people in our \nsupply chain has been unwavering, anchored \nby a simple set of beliefs: People deserve to be \ntreated with dignity and to know their rights. \nThey should be able to speak up if those rights \nare not being respected \u2014 and to know and \nexpect that when they do, we will listen and act. \nWe\u2019re committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain.\nWe are committed to respecting the rights of \nevery individual in our supply chain \u2014 just like \nwe do for our team members, customers, and \nother partners \u2014 and more broadly, to working \nwith others to share our tools and the lessons \nwe\u2019ve learned, and to empowering everyone to \nachieve progress more rapidly.\nListening to workers\nEffective grievance channels, ongoing worker \nmanagement communications, and supplier \nemployee feedback are essential to ensuring \nrespect for worker rights and maintaining \nsafe and healthy workplaces. Whether \nthrough social dialogue and formal employee \nrepresentation, workplace satisfaction \nsurveys, anonymous hotlines, focus groups, \nor interviews during annual assessments, the \nfeedback we receive directly from supplier \nemployees helps us ensure labor and human \nrights are respected throughout our global \nsupply chain. We also use this feedback \nto address emerging risks, improve rights \ntraining for supplier employees and supplier \nmanagement, and to continually strengthen our \nCode and Standards.\n\u2022\t Rights awareness: We believe that \nprotection starts with rights awareness, \nand since 2008, more than 23.6 million \nsupplier employees have been trained on \ntheir workplace rights. Under our Code and \nStandards, suppliers are required to provide \nemployees with training on their workplace \nrights. This training is generally conducted \nduring new employee orientation, and \ncovers international labor standards, local \nlabor laws, environmental health and safety, \nand the protections required by our Code \nand Standards\n\u2022\t Feedback channels: Supplier employee \ninterviews are an important part of every \nassessment conducted. Each year, we \ninterview tens of thousands of supplier \nemployees in their local language and \nwithout their managers present, to determine \nwhether or not their experience on the job \naligns with auditors\u2019 observations during \nassessments.

In 2021, we anonymously \nsurveyed 264,963 supplier employees in \n191 facilities across Greater China, India, \nIreland, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, \nUK, U.S., and Vietnam about their workplace \nexperiences \u2014 nearly double the number of \nsupplier employees surveyed last fiscal year. \nAs a result, suppliers took 3944 actions, \nincluding better commute options, increasing \nwages and bonuses, offering better food \nvariety, and skill development opportunities \nfor entry-level managers.\nResponsible labor recruitment\nOur Code and Standards, and the protections \nthey provide, apply equally to all workers, \nregardless of a person\u2019s job, geographic \nlocation, or how they enter our supply chain \n\u2014 and this commitment begins even before \na worker ever enters our supply chain. This \nincludes zero tolerance for forced labor. \nWe implement strict policies and procedures \nwith our suppliers to protect workers in our \nsupply chain from forced labor. This includes \nselecting suppliers for assessments based \non factors, such as their geographic location, \nwhich may put them at higher risk of forced \nlabor violations, as well as their previous \nperformance and/or history of violations or \nallegations. Suppliers may also receive additional \nspecialized assessments based on the nature \nof their business or employee population, such \nas those that employ Foreign Contract Workers, \nand those located in higher risk migration \ncorridors. Our Code and Standards also require \nthat all supplier employees have an effective \nmechanism to report grievances. In addition, \nwe provide third-party anonymous hotlines and \nthe ability to contact the Apple Environment and \nSupply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at \nany time and in any language. When an issue \nis raised, supplier management is required to \npromptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a \ntimely manner.\nWe strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor \nthroughout our worldwide supply chain and look \nfor evidence of it in every supplier assessment \nwe conduct, including unannounced \nassessments. Last year, we conducted more \nthan 1100 assessments, and found no instances \nwhere anyone was forced to work in our \nsupply chain. \nWe did discover two cases in Taiwan in which \npeople paid recruitment fees to secure their \njob, which is a violation of our Code. We \nrequired the supplier to directly repay their \nemployees in full, and verified repayment \nthrough a third-party auditor. The payment of \nrecruitment fees, withholding an employee\u2019s \npassport or personal identity documents, \nor restricting an employee\u2019s freedom of \nmovement are Core Violations of our Code \nand Standards \u2014 the most serious level of \nCode violations. If we discover workers have \npaid recruitment fees at any point on their \nemployment journey to an Apple supplier, we \nrequire supplier management to take prompt \naction to provide remedy to those affected \nby directly repaying their workers for any and \nall fees, even if the supplier was unaware \nthat their employees had paid recruitment \nfees. From 2008 through fiscal year 2021, \nour suppliers have repaid $33.2 million in \nrecruitment fees directly to 37,322 workers.\nFinally, in collaboration with the International \nOrganization for Migration (IOM) and the \nResponsible Business Alliance (RBA), we \nexpanded our Responsible Labor Recruitment \nToolkit to more than 39 additional supplier \nfacilities in 10 countries, reaching nearly 77,000 \nworkers globally, with 66 percent of those \nworking on Apple production lines.\n23.6M \nsupplier employees trained on their  \nrights since 2008 \n352,589\nsupplier employees directly engaged about \ntheir workplace experiences, through \ninterviews and satisfaction surveys\n220,000\nsupplier employees reached by grievance \nhotline awareness campaign\nAppendix\nGovernance\nCommunities\nSuppliers\nCustomers\nOur People\nEnvironment\nIntroduction \nApple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   41\n",

In the more than 50 countries \nand regions where our suppliers \noperate, we have teams of experts, \nincluding independent third parties, \nwho monitor our suppliers and put in \nplace industry-leading procedures \nto help ensure that no one is forced \nto work. Our comprehensive policies \nstart before we even sign a contract \nwith suppliers, and we are consistently \nraising the bar. \n1 \t We set the highest standards.\n\t\n\u0007Eliminating forced labor begins with setting \nand maintaining the highest standards. Our \nstandards often go above and beyond legal \nrequirements to protect people from forced \nlabor risks.\n2 \t We engage early.\n\t\n\u0007To address forced labor risks at its roots,  \nwe know that our work has to begin before \npeople enter our supply chain.\n3 \t We hold suppliers accountable.\n\t\n\u0007Once we\u2019ve implemented thorough \npreventative measures, independent, \nthird-party assessments verify that our \nsuppliers are meeting our standards. \nLooking for evidence of forced labor is part \nof every supplier assessment. If we find any \nviolations of our Code and Standards, we \ntake swift action to remedy the issue and \nimprove their operations.\n4 \t \u0007We track progress  \nand report transparently.\n\t\n\u0007Consistent improvement requires \ntransparency and accountability. Since \n2007, we have been publishing reports \non our efforts across all of our work \nto transparently share our progress \nand challenges.\n5 \t \u0007We regularly engage and  \npartner with\u00a0stakeholders.\n\t\n\u0007Engagement with stakeholders and rights \nholders is critical to accountability, ensuring \nwe\u2019re taking action where it\u2019s needed, and to \nachieving rapid progress. \n\t\nAligning with international frameworks.\n\t\n\u0007Apple policies and our supplier requirements align with \ninternational labor and human rights standards, including those \nof the International Labour Organization, the United Nations \nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and \nthe Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development.\n\t\nThe Apple Human Rights Policy\n\t\n\u0007Our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone, \nincluding our customers, employees, business partners,  \nand the people across every level of our supply chain. \n\t\nRead the Apple Human Rights Policy\n\t\n\u0007The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier \nResponsibility Standards\n\t\n\u0007Our supplier requirements contain strict standards for \nresponsible labor recruitment, and apply to all suppliers, \nprotecting workers globally. We go above and beyond legal \nrequirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor \nrecruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate  \ndue diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy, \nbecause we believe no one should pay to secure a job. \n\t\n\u0007Read the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct \nand Supplier Responsibility Standards\n\t\nThorough mapping informs our strategy.\n\t\n\u0007An effective strategy requires deep understanding of our \nsupply chain. To date, we have mapped over 1000 labor \nrecruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across \n32\u00a0countries.\n\t\nA leading strategy requires leading tools.\n\t\n\u0007The Apple Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit, developed \nin partnership with the International Organization for \nMigration, provides suppliers and their labor agencies with \neasy-to-use tools that help them effectively manage and \nreport data, mitigating forced labor risks before people even \nenter our supply chain. In addition to providing hands-on \ntraining, we are making these tools openly available for others \nto use.\n\t\nAwareness is power.\n\t\n\u0007We require our suppliers to provide their employees with \ntraining on their workplace rights on their first day on the \njob. This helps to ensure that every person is aware of \ntheir rights and what to do if they\u2019re not being respected, \nwhich includes the ability to anonymously contact Apple \ndirectly. Foreign Contract Workers, who make up a very \nsmall percentage of people in our supply chain, also receive \ntraining prior to leaving their home country, as well as upon \narriving in their destination country. To date, our suppliers \nhave provided workplace rights training to over 23.6 million \npeople. In addition, last year we directly engaged with over \n350,000 people in our supply chain to learn more about their \nworkplace experience. \n\t\nInvesting in consistent improvement.\n\t\n\u0007Through our new Supplier Employee Development Fund, \nwe\u2019re investing $50M to expand programs designed \nto continue to improve the rights training experience, \nworker voice platforms, and supplier employee education \nopportunities.\n\t\nA close look.\n\t\n\u0007We regularly conduct independent, third-party assessments, \nincluding surprise assessments, of our suppliers, verifying \ncompliance with over 500 points across our standards. This \nincludes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring \nand personnel records are in place and accurate. In addition \nto specialized forced labor assessments for at-risk suppliers, \nwe also require many suppliers to participate in facility-wide \nassessments, such as the Validated Assessment Program, \nto verify performance across the supplier\u2019s entire business. \nIn the event that we find gaps in a supplier\u2019s compliance \nor capabilities, we require them to implement a Corrective \nAction Plan. To date, our assessments have covered 94 \npercent of our direct manufacturing spend. \n\t\nWe investigate every report.\n\t\n\u0007In addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers\u2019 performance \nin upholding our standards, we also receive reports from the \npress, governments, civil society, and people in our supply \nchain, and we encourage the public to report concerns via \nhttps://www.apple.com/uk/supplier-responsibility/. We \ninvestigate every report, and frequently have Apple teams \nonsite within 24 hours.\n \n\t Swift action and steep penalties.\n\t\n\u0007Forced labor in any form is a Core Violation (the most serious \nviolation level) of our requirements. If a Core Violation is \ndiscovered, the supplier\u2019s CEO is notified and the supplier \nis immediately placed on probation, pending the successful \ncompletion of a Corrective Action Plan. Probation can include \nno new projects, no new business, and termination of existing \nbusiness. In addition to commercial penalties, if a supplier is \nunable or unwilling to meet our standards, they risk removal \nfrom our supply chain. Since 2009, we have directed the \nremoval of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170 \nsmelters and refiners for failure to meet our requirements.\n \n\t Action this year.\n\t\n\u0007In FY21, across more than 1100 assessments, we found \nno instances where anyone was forced to work in our \nsupply chain. We did find two cases where employees of \nthe same supplier in Taiwan paid recruitment fees. Per our \nrequirements, the supplier directly repaid their employees for \nthose fees. To date, our suppliers have directly repaid $33.2M \nin recruitment fees to 37,322 of their employees.\n\t\n\u0007People and Environment in Our Supply \nChain\u00a0Annual Progress Report\n\t\n\u0007Published annually since 2007 (formerly known as the \nSupplier Responsibility Progress Report), this report contains \na detailed accounting of our progress, challenges, and future \nplans across all areas of our supplier requirements.\n\t\nRead our Annual Progress Report\n\t\n\u0007Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking \nand\u00a0Slavery Disclosure\n\t\n\u0007This disclosure is a specialized filing that focuses specifically \non our efforts to prevent and address forced labor risks \nthroughout our supply chain, and includes our due diligence \nprocess for our entire business, including manufacturing, \nmaterials and goods sourcing, and services.

BDR celebrates \ncorporations that achieved spending of at least $1 billion with minority- and  \nwoman-owned businesses. \nIn calendar year 2021, Apple spent over $7.1 billion with diverse suppliers around the \nworld. Our Supplier Diversity program offers support to participating suppliers and \nseeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities. For example, \nsupplier development has been a long-standing commitment within Apple\u2019s supply \nchain, which is facilitated internally and externally. Externally, we partner with major \nuniversities to provide executive development and capacity building to key diverse \nsuppliers.

Over the \npast five years, more than 5000 students have \nparticipated in our Line Leader, Automation \nTechnician, and general apprenticeship \nprograms. These programs give participants \nthe skills they need to pursue opportunities in \nhighly technical roles. In 2021, 5883 supplier \nemployees at 18 supplier sites participated \nin technical training, including programs on \nrobotics, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) \nmachines, and mobile device repair.\nCoding \nSince 2017, we\u2019ve offered training to supplier \nemployees on Apple\u2019s Swift coding language \n\u2014 a skill that is in high demand. In 2021, we \ncontinued to build on feedback from students \nand suppliers to refine our curriculum by adding \nmore opportunities for virtual learning while \nmaintaining the quality and consistency of \nthe programs.\nEnvironment\nHuman rights and environmental protection \nare inextricably linked. And we\u2019re taking action \naccordingly. As we build products that enrich \nthe lives of people around the world, we have \na profound responsibility to do so in a way that \nminimizes our resource use while protecting the \nlocal environments and communities where we \nand our suppliers operate.\nWe work with our suppliers to help us address \nour environmental commitments, including our \ngoal to become carbon neutral by 2030 across \nour entire product footprint. Our Supplier Energy \nEfficiency Program and Supplier Clean Energy \nProgram both address direct and indirect \nemissions in our supply chain, while our Supplier \nClean Water and Zero Waste programs help to \nreduce resource usage.\nIn addition, our Code contains strict \nenvironmental protections, which require our \nsuppliers to understand and take active steps \nto reduce their environmental impact while also \nbecoming better stewards of the resources \nwe all share and the communities in which \nwe operate. Specifically, our Code addresses \nthe management of regulated substances, \nstormwater, wastewater, air emissions, waste, \nand noise, as well as pollution prevention, \nresource reduction, and obtaining necessary \nenvironmental permits.\nMore detail about our environment work in the \nsupply chain is covered on page 13, as well as \nin People and Environment in Our Supply Chain \nReport and the Environmental Progress Report.\nApple has invested in the 2300-acre IP Radian Solar project in Brown County, Texas.\nAppendix\nGovernance\nCommunities\nSuppliers\nCustomers\nOur People\nEnvironment\nIntroduction \nApple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   46\n",

Magnifier, Apple\u2019s built-in app \nfor iPhone and iPad, turns the camera into a \ndigital magnifying glass to increase the size of \nany physical object you point it at. The People \nDetection feature in Magnifier uses camera, \nLiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine \nlearning to help support health and safety for \nusers who are blind or have low vision and need \nto maintain social distancing. \nHearing\nTo support customers who are deaf or hard of \nhearing, Apple was the first to directly connect \nhearing aids or a cochlear implant to iPhone \nand other iOS devices through the Made for \niPhone (MFi) program. This enables customers \nto make phone calls and stream high-quality \naudio directly to their MFi hearing devices. And \nin 2021, Apple added support for the latest \ngeneration of bidirectional hearing aids from \nMade for iPhone partners that support hands-\nfree phone and FaceTime conversations. \nSound Recognition notifies users of external \nenvironmental sounds like running water, \nalarms, electrical appliances, breaking glass, \nand more, with the newly introduced option \nto train your iPhone or iPad to listen for a \nspecific alarm or electrical appliance sound. \nOther features include Live Captions (beta), \nintroduced in 2022, which helps users with \nhearing disabilities follow along with calls and \nmedia on iPhone, iPad, and Mac; sign language \nprominence in FaceTime, which can detect \nwhen someone uses sign language in group \ncalls; and Conversation Boost for AirPods Pro, \nwhich helps users better hear conversations in \ncrowded or noisy environments. \nMobility\nUsers with limited mobility can use Switch \nControl to navigate their device with a variety \nof switches, including head-tracking, back \ntap, sound actions, and certified MFi switches. \nVoice Control helps a user control a device \nwith voice commands across iPhone, iPad, \nand Mac. On Apple Watch, AssistiveTouch \nfor Apple Watch helps users with upper-body \nlimb differences to enjoy the benefits of Apple \nWatch without having to touch the display. And \nApple Watch Mirroring, introduced in 2022, \nsupports users with quadriplegia or other \nphysical and motor disabilities in controlling \nApple Watch via iPhone using assistive features \nsuch as Switch Control and Voice Control. \niPadOS supports third-party eye-tracking \ndevices, making it possible for people to \ncontrol iPad using just their eyes. With Touch \nAccommodations, customers can control \nhow long they touch the screen before it\u2019s \nrecognized and whether repeat touches are \nignored, while Back Tap lets users double-\ntap or triple-tap the back of their iPhone to \nautomatically perform a range of custom tasks, \nfrom opening an app to taking a screenshot.\nCognitive\nOur products are built with an array of features \nto support people who are neurodivergent or \nhave cognitive disabilities. Background sounds \nhelp minimize distractions and support users \nwho want to focus, stay calm, or rest. With \nSpeak Selection for iOS and macOS, audio \ncan be used to support reading or writing \ncomprehension, and Dictation and Siri help \nanyone who finds speaking easier than typing \nor writing. Another feature, Guided Access, \nlimits a device to a single app and lets users \ncontrol which features are available.\nThe People Detection feature in Magnifier uses the LiDAR camera in iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPad Pro to \nhelp support health and safety for users who are blind or have low vision and need to maintain social distancing. \nCommunity support\nApple offers extensive support documentation, \nengaging online training content, and in-store \nsessions to help anyone learn how to use our \nbuilt-in accessibility features.

In 2019, the consortium \nadopted Apple\u2019s recommendation for more \ninclusive and representational emoji. And in \n2021, we expanded the accessibility options for \nMemoji to include cochlear implants, an oxygen \ntube, and a soft helmet.\nInclusive design\nBuilding on our accessibility work, we\u2019ve \nalways believed that in order to create the most \npersonal technology in the world, we must \nconsider the full range of human experiences. \nAll across Apple there is a sustained \ncommitment to making products more inclusive \nfor a wide range of diverse groups. Apple \nengineers work hand in hand with teams across \nthe business to help solve unique problems \nothers seldom think about. \nFor example, with iOS 14.5, Siri no longer has a \ndefault voice, allowing users to choose the voice \nthat speaks to them when they first set up their \ndevice, and in English, users can now select \nmore diverse voice options. We\u2019re also taking \nsteps to ensure equity in our cameras\u2019 automatic \nperson recognition features so that everyone \ncan have the same extraordinary experience, \nno matter the photographic subject\u2019s skin color, \nage, or gender. As a result, the machine learning \nmodels used in camera technology must show \nsimilar performance across various age groups, \ngenders, ethnicities, skin tones, and other \nattributes. We\u2019ve also published research  \non this work to help others learn from it.\nBeyond our own products and services, \nwe\u2019ve developed machine learning research \nand Human Interface Guidelines to support \ndevelopers in building inclusive apps that \nput people first by prioritizing respectful \ncommunication and presenting content and \nfunctionality in ways that everyone can access \nand understand. Some of the characteristics \nto consider include age, gender and gender \nidentity, race and ethnicity, language and culture, \nand social and economic context, among \nothers. We also provide tools, documentation, \nsample code, and design best practices to help \ndevelopers make their apps more accessible. \nWe launched two videos during our Worldwide \nDevelopers Conference (WWDC) in June \n2021 on the process and practice of inclusive \ndesign that were among the most popular of the \nweek: The Process of Inclusive Design and The \nPractice of Inclusive Design.\nA preview of innovative accessibility features combining  \nthe power of hardware, software, and machine learning\nIn May 2022, we previewed software features coming later this year that offer users \nwith disabilities new tools for navigation, health, communication, and more. Using \nadvancements across hardware, software, and machine learning, people who are blind  \nor low vision can use their iPhone and iPad to navigate the last few feet to their destination \nwith Door Detection; users with physical and motor disabilities who may rely on assistive \nfeatures like Voice Control and Switch Control can fully control Apple Watch from their \niPhone with Apple Watch Mirroring; and the Deaf and hard of hearing community can  \nfollow Live Captions on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Our Racial Equity \nand Justice Initiative (REJI) is focused on three \nkey areas: expanding access to education, \nsupporting criminal justice reform, and \nremoving economic barriers for communities \nof color.\nThe initiative began in June 2020 with an \ninitial commitment of $100 million, followed \nby an additional $30 million commitment in \nAugust 2021, to help elevate equity-focused \nsolutions across the academic and advocacy \nlandscapes, and a $25 million commitment \nin May 2022 to expand access to capital for \ncommunity financial institutions supporting \ncommunities of color.\nREJI has spurred new partnerships and projects \nwhile inspiring us to weave a focus on equity \nand justice into everything we do \u2014 including \nour existing community programs  \nand business operations.\nEducation: Greater access  \nand greater\u00a0opportunity\nREJI builds on our long-standing commitment \nto education and works hand in hand with our \nCommunity Education Initiative (page 62). \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities \n(HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), \nand Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) \nare critical leaders in expanding educational \naccess, as are community colleges and other \ncenters of learning. To support their continued \nleadership, Apple is collaborating with minority-\nserving institutions on programs designed to \nbuild a more inclusive workforce.\nPropel Center: In January 2021, Apple, in \ncollaboration with Southern Company and \na range of community stakeholders, helped \nlaunch the Propel Center, a global innovation \nand learning hub for the HBCU community. \nThe Propel Center supports HBCU students \nand faculty through a robust virtual platform, \na physical campus in the historic Atlanta \nUniversity Center, as well as on-campus \nactivations at partner institutions. The center \nis designed to support the next generation of \ndiverse leaders, providing innovative curricula, \ntechnology support, career opportunities, \nand fellowship programs. Experts from \nApple support the development of curricula \nand provide ongoing mentorship and \nlearning support.\nHSI Innovation Hub: In August 2021, we \nannounced our partnership with California \nState University (CSU) Northridge\u2019s Global HSI \nEquity Innovation Hub, which aims to transform \nHSIs throughout the CSU system and the U.S. \nin order to increase student success and equip \nLatinx and other students from historically \nunderserved groups with skills for high-\ndemand careers in STEM.

These \nsuppliers provide equipment, parts, and \nmaterials for all of our core products.\nJobs in the iOS app economy\nSince the App Store launched in 2008, the \niOS app economy has become one of the \nworld\u2019s fastest-growing sectors. The App Store \necosystem supports millions of jobs across \nthe world, empowering entrepreneurs from \nArgentina and Alaska to Zimbabwe and beyond. \nIn the U.S., it supports more than 2.2 million \njobs, and in Europe, it supports another \n2.2 million jobs.\nIn January 2021, we launched the App Store \nSmall Business Program, which benefits the vast \nmajority of developers who sell digital goods and \nservices on the App Store. The program cuts the \nApp Store commission in half \u2014 to 15 percent \u2014 \nfor small businesses that earned up to $1 million \nin proceeds during the previous year. The \nreduced commission means small entrepreneurs \nand app makers have more resources to create \nnew jobs, expand their businesses, explore \ncutting-edge technologies, and pioneer new \ninnovations that reach users around the world.\nVolunteers from retail in the San Francisco Bay Area participated in a food sort and packaging event at the \nSan Francisco-Marin Food Bank.

Stakeholders provide valuable \nexpertise as we develop our programs, and by \ncollaborating with other stakeholders, we can \ndrive more impact on the issues we care about \nthan any one of us could make on our own.\nThroughout the year, we proactively engage \nwith a wide range of stakeholders and rights \nholders, including:\nOur people\nWe believe that open and honest communication \namong team members, managers, and \nleadership fosters an open, collaborative work \nenvironment where everyone can participate, \ndevelop, and thrive. Our peoples\u2019 voices and \nideas drive innovation in everything we do \n\u2014 from informing diversity initiatives to the \ninclusive benefits that support employees of \nall backgrounds through every life stage. In \naddition to managers listening to their teams, \nwe conduct surveys to better understand team \nmember views across key topics, and we provide \nchannels for employees to share concerns \nwith leadership. Read more in Our People on \npage 22. \nSuppliers\nWhether through social dialogue and \nformal employee representation, workplace \nsatisfaction surveys, anonymous hotlines, \nfocus groups, or interviews during annual \nassessments, the feedback we receive directly \nfrom supplier employees helps us ensure \nthat labor and human rights are respected \nthroughout our global supply chain. We also \nuse this feedback to address emerging risks, \nimprove rights training for supplier employees \nand management, and continually strengthen \nour Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier \nResponsibility Standards.\nCustomers\nWe\u2019re motivated by creating the best user \nexperience through our products and in every \ninteraction with our customers. To help ensure \nquality, we continually monitor customer \nfeedback, assess key drivers, and leverage \nanalytics to improve the customer experience. \nCustomer feedback is shared with team \nmembers as well as leaders, so that everyone \nunderstands their impact and is focused on \nmaking the customer experience the best  \nit can possibly be.

In fiscal year 2021, these include electricity transmission and \ndistribution losses amounted to about 28,000 metric tons CO2e and life \ncycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about \n95,000 metric tons CO2e. We have not accounted for emissions resulting \nfrom employees working from home, because we anticipated these \nemissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving \nour methodology. \n5.\t We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability \nstandards. So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions \nfrom business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air \ntravel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions \nincreased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018. Without the methodology \nchange, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflects \nthe growth in our business.\n6.\t Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology to reflect the \nimpact of COVID-19 on employee commute.\n7.\t We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project \nin Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal \nyear 2021. This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\n8.\t Because we\u2019re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine \nour product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example, \nwe recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our \nproducts are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid \nemission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. The  \nnet result was an increase in our 2021 carbon footprint. When using the \nsame level of data granularity and model as 2021, our product use carbon \nemissions in 2021 would have been about 2.5 percent lower.\n9.\t For fiscal year 2021, we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya, \nand purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total \nof 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. The first \nproject, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and \nconserves forests from deforestation and degradation. The second project \naims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not \notherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China. \nBoth projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for \nprojects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCBS. These projects are all \ncertified to the VCS and CCB standards.\n10.\tDue to rounding, our gross and net carbon footprints do not always the sum \nof the subtotals disclosed above. \n\u0007Notes: For data on previous years, please reference past Environmental Progress \nReports, available at apple.com/environment.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate \nfacilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate \ncontrols due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not \nincluded in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. \nWe also recognize that energy use at our employees\u2019 homes likely increased \nduring this period.

All references to a year throughout \nthe report refer to Apple\u2019s fiscal years, unless \n\u201ccalendar year\u201d is specified. Apple\u2019s fiscal year \nis the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the \nlast Saturday of September. \nAlignment to reporting frameworks: The \nreport leverages reporting frameworks and \nstandards such as the Global Reporting Initiative \n(GRI), Sustainable Accounting Standards Board \n(SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD). Apple\u2019s ESG \nIndex maps the disclosures in this report and \nother Apple publications against the metrics \nin these reporting frameworks, as relevant to \nour business.\nData assurance: We obtain third-party \nverification for scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse \ngas emissions, as well as energy use, paper \nuse, and waste and water impacts for our \ndata centers, offices, and retail stores \nworldwide. Apex Companies (Apex) provides \n\u201creasonable assurance\u201d \u2014 one of the highest \nlevels of verification in the industry \u2014 for \nthis environmental impact data.. Apex also \nprovides \u201climited assurance\u201d of scope 3 \nrenewable energy production and avoided \ncarbon emissions related to our Supplier \nClean Energy Program as well as energy \nsavings associated with our Supplier Energy \nEfficiency Program. Scope 3 greenhouse gas \nemissions related to our products, calculated \nusing life cycle assessment, are checked \nfor quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer \nInstitute in Germany in accordance with \nthe internationally recognized ISO 14000 \nenvironmental management standards: \nISO 14040 and 14044. Finally, Apple\u2019s \nplastic packaging footprint is also reviewed \nby Fraunhofer Institute. These assurance \nstatements are available on pages 100-120 of \nApple\u2019s 2022 Environmental Progress Report. \nData in this report reflects estimates using \nmethodologies and assumptions believed to \nbe reasonable and accurate. Those estimates, \nmethodologies and assumptions may change \nin the future as a result of new information or \nsubsequent developments.\nThose estimates, methodologies and \nassumptions may change in the future as a \nresult of new information or subsequent \ndevelopments.\nForward-looking statements: The report does \nnot cover all information about our business. \nReferences in this report to information \nshould not be construed as a characterization \nregarding the materiality of such information to \nour financial results or for purposes of the U.S. \nsecurities laws.

Some plastic is still found on packaging \ncomponents made primarily of fiber.\n9\t These savings do not include reduction in  \nwater use from facility closures and reduced \noccupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nWe consider those savings temporary and also \nacknowledge that the water use was transferred to \nemployees\u2019 homes. \n10\t This total includes freshwater use as well as \nalternative water sources, including recycled \nwater, rainwater, and recovered condensate. We \ndefine freshwater as drinking-water quality, the \nmajority of which comes from municipal sources \nand less than 5 percent comes from onsite \ngroundwater sources. Recycled water represents a \nkey alternative water source. Our recycled water is \nsourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, \nwith less than 5 percent from onsite treatment. \nRecycled water is primarily used for irrigation, \nmake-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing. Other \nalternative sources of freshwater include rainwater \nand recovered condensate that is captured onsite. \nWater used for construction for activities like dust \ncontrol is not included in this total, and represents \n13 million gallons of water used in fiscal year 2021. \nOur actual water discharge may vary by 10 percent \nrelative to our estimates. In these estimates, we\u2019ve \ntaken into account consumptive activities including \nirrigation and cooling towers.\n11\t We are now accounting for savings through \nthis program on a fiscal year basis, rather \nthan a calendar year basis as was reported in \nprevious\u00a0years. \n12\t Waste diversion rates do not include construction \nand demolition waste or electronic waste for fiscal \nyear 2020.
