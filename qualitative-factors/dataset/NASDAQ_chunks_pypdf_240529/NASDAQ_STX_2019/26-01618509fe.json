{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY027 \nCASE STUDY:  \nDELL\nIn FY2019, Seagate worked with Dell, a  \nkey customer, as well as partners Teleplan \nand Shin Etsu to develop a closed loop \nrare earth metal recycling project.  \nThrough Dell\u2019s product take-back \nprogram, we collected 300 kilograms \nof scrap HDD magnets from various \nmanufacturers of HDDs. Neodymium \nOxide was extracted from these magnets, \nproviding the material needed to build \nnew magnets, which was utilized in  \nnew HDD builds. \nAs a result of this, 25,000 Seagate hard \ndrives were produced with recycled \nmaterials. These drives were used in  \nthe Dell Latitude 5000 series laptop. Mining and processing rare earth metals \nis known to have environmental and \nhealth related challenges. By reusing \nrare earth metals, we are able to mine \nless, thus reducing environmental \ndamage and lowering health concerns \nfor the communities in which these \nmetals are mined. \nIn FY2020, we are looking to \noperationalize this process as a part  \nof our ongoing business, and apply  \nthe learnings from this project into  \nother circularity initiatives. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
