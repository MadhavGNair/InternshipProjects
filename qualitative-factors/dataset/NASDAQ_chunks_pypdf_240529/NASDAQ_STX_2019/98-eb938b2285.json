{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nSUPPLY CHAIN099 \nWe remain aware of the risk of child \nlabor, forced labor, and threats to the \nfreedom of association within our supply \nchain. The highest risk of forced labor in \nour supply chain is where foreign labor is \nutilized; suppliers in Malaysia, Thailand, \nand Singapore pose the highest risk. \nOur training on forced labor has been \nfocused on suppliers in these countries \nover the past three years. Based on \nsupplier VAP audits, child labor has not \nbeen identified as a serious concern in our supply chain. However, various \nNGOs report that student workers in the \nChina supply chain represent an area of \npossible concern for the region. \nAs for freedom of association and \ncollective bargaining, our audit results \nhave not identified any geographies of \nconcern in FY2019. Most of the findings \nin this area are related to suppliers not \nhaving a policy/procedure on the right of \npeaceful assembly.
