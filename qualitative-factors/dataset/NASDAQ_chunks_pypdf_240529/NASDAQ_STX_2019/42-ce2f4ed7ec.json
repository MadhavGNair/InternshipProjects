In FY2019, we saved \napproximately 16,000 MWh of electricity \nthrough energy conservation and \nefficiency initiatives, exceeding our \nconservation goal of 10,000 MWh  \nfor the year. Energy savings are \ncalculated using the Metered Baseline \nMethod (MBM); since FY2014 the site \ninitiated energy conservation projects, \nfocused mainly on electricity, have \nsaved a cumulative 170,000 MWh.  \nOur conservation goal for FY2020 is \n14,000 MWh. \nRenewable, solar energy is an area \nwe are evaluating as we work on reducing our GHG emissions. At our \ndesign center in Fremont, California, \nwe generated a total of 1,000 MWh of \nrenewable, solar energy throughout \nCY2018. Seagate is aligning to the  \nISO standards in implementation an \nenergy management system to drive \na common and sustainable energy \nmanagement program across all \nmanufacturing sites. Our manufacturing \nsites in Wuxi, China, and Londonderry, \nNorthern Ireland, are certified to ISO \n50001 Energy Management System.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
