{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nSUPPLY CHAIN096 \nFor service providers, such as canteen \nproviders and janitorial services, we  \nrequire adherence to Seagate\u2019s SOPs.  \nThis ensures that all on-site service \nproviders are held to the same standards \nas our own workforce. Seagate does \nnot currently use foreign labor via agents, \nand we partner with recruitment agents \nin both China and the U.S. who provide \nlocal talent.\nOur Supply Chain organization has full-\ntime staff and dedicated resources to \nmonitor RBA compliance and education, \nand ensure adherence to applicable \nglobal and local laws. \nCollaboration is key for success in our \nsupply chain, and as such, Seagate \nplays host to multiple Executive Business \nReviews. These reviews show our RBA \ncompliance and sustainability efforts \nto supplier leadership. Engaging our \nsuppliers on key projects that focus on \nissues like RBA conformance, financial \nsustainability, and process improvement \nenables us to continue innovating for \neveryone\u2019s benefit. \nPart of that engagement is the training \nthat we provide. In FY2019, we trained \nour procurement staff on forced labor to increase awareness of the issue, using \nthe RBA eLearning on Forced Labor/\nHuman Trafficking. We also provided \ntraining for Seagate suppliers in high \nrisk countries by co-organizing two \ndays of RBA training on the following \ntopics: Supply Chain Risk Assessment \n(including Foreign Worker Risk), Water \nManagement (including Conservation, \nRecycling and Treatment, and Discharge) \nand Process Chemistry. Over 70 \nsuppliers from Singapore, Malaysia, \nThailand and Taiwan participated in  \nfour sections of this training. \nIn FY2019, we updated our anti-slavery \nstatement, which includes due diligence \nin our supply chain. You can view the \nAnti-Slavery and Human Trafficking \nStatement  on our website. This statement \nwas published in response to the \nCalifornia Transparency in Supply Chain \nAct and the United Kingdom Modern \nSlavery Act, and to demonstrate our \nefforts as a company in preventing \nslavery and human trafficking in our \nbusiness and supply chain. \nWe also worked with our suppliers to \nensure compliance with the Countering \nAmerica\u2019s Adversaries Through \nSanctions Act (CAATSA). This U.S. Supplier Engagement and Collaboration \nProactive engagement with suppliers helps to ensure our goals and \nstandards are aligned, and Seagate regularly meets with suppliers to \nshare expectations and evaluate our level of engagement.
