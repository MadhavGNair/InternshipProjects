In conversations with their managers \nand guided by our online Virtual Coach resources, employees develop \ngoals. Throughout the year, managers and employees are encouraged \nto engage in ongoing dialogue and coaching to assess progress to \nperformance. This model helps managers and employees identify \nstrengths, improve outcomes, and close performance gaps.\nOur operator employees work directly \nwith their supervisors to receive ongoing \nfeedback and coaching throughout \nthe year. Our non-operator employees \ndevelop two to three clear, meaningful \ngoals and one stretch goal to drive \ninnovation, all aligned to our overall \ncompany strategy. Progress against \ngoals, and demonstrated behaviors, is \nassessed twice during the fiscal year. In FY2019, our goal was to have 95 percent \nof our non-operator employees participate \nin the performance management process. \nWe exceeded this goal with 99 percent of \nour non-operator employees completing \nthe goal setting, mid-year, and year-end \nreview processes in our online system \nand 99 percent receiving a year-end goal \nreview with their manager.Performance ManagementEMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE, \nLEARNING, AND ENGAGEMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 81, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
