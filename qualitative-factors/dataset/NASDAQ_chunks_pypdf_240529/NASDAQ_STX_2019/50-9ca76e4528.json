More information on risks \nand opportunities posed by climate \nchange can be found in our CDP report . \nFor technology products, Scope 3 \nemissions are typically much higher \nthan Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, \nparticularly those from product use \n(the use profile of the product has \nchanged, meaning emissions change; \nproducts like the drives that cloud providers use are running longer \nhours, upping their Scope 3 emissions \nimpact.) Seagate\u2019s continued efforts \nto reduce the amount of energy used \nby our products is important for this \nvery reason. Learning from our current \nproducts and continuously improving \nas we create new ones is one way \nthat we can decrease those Scope \n3 emissions. Our LCA results help to \ninform us of sustainability impacts, \nsuch as energy usage, along with \npotential improvements in packaging \nand products. The goal is for each \ngeneration of products to be more \nenergy efficient (EB/watt) when \ncompared with previous generations.
