While it is confirmed that the 10 \nadded substances are not present in \nany Seagate products or components, \nupdated REACH Declarations were \ngenerated and made available as \nan assurance to customers that the \nDeclarations account for the complete \nlist of 201 substances. \nRoHS established four additions to \nthe restricted substances in Annex \nII to Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2). \nSpecifically, there are four types of \nphthalates, abbreviated as DEHP, \nBBP , DBP and DIBP . As these updates \nwere effective in July 2019, Seagate \nspent FY2019 requiring analysis for the \nadded substances in the component \nlevel RoHS Lab analyses provided \nby suppliers. Seagate also included \ntesting for the additional substances \nin the Finished Goods (FG) RoHS \nanalyses that Seagate provides at \nproduct launch, as well as updating \nRoHS analysis for the four substances \nin FG HDD families launched prior to \n2018. The updated RoHS lab analyses were completed well ahead of the \neffective date of July 2019, and updated \nRoHS Declarations of Compliance \nwere generated and made available to \nSeagate customers.  \nTo help customers comply with these \nsame requirements at the finished \nproduct level, we aim to exceed, rather \nthan meet the requirements, giving our \ncustomers enough time to manage their \nown product compliance. This diligence \ngives our customers the opportunity \nto participate in programs such as \nthe Electronic Product Environmental \nAssessment Tool (EPEAT). Seagate \nproducts are generally components, \nfor which no EPEAT standards apply. \nHowever, our ability to verify RoHS \ncompliance and identify product \ncomposition at both the homogeneous \nmaterial and article levels provides \ncustomers the assurance that the \nincorporation of Seagate components \ninto their final products will support \ntheir ability to meet the relevant EPEAT \nrequired and optional criteria for their \nfinal products.
