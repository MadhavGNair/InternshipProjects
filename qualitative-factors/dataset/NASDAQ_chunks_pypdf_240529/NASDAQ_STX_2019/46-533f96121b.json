{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY047 \nOur carbon emissions data is collected \nby Calendar Year (CY), and our baseline \nyear is CY2017. In CY2018, our Scope \n1 emissions (GHG emissions generated \ndirectly at our sites) reduced by 1.2 \npercent to 259,307 metric tons of CO2e. \nThe majority of this decrease comes \nfrom process improvements across our \nmanufacturing sites. \nWe are still facing challenges with our \nuse of a hydrofluorocarbon solvent \nin our media manufacturing process, \nwhich results in fugitive emissions, and are committed to finding a suitable \nreplacement. This solvent is a necessary \npart of our manufacturing processes, \nand has a very high global warming \npotential. Our media design teams in \nFremont, California work closely with \nteams at our manufacturing site in \nSingapore to qualify a replacement \nfor this solvent, and improve process \nefficiency. The hydrofluorocarbon \nsolvent we currently use contributed \nto nearly 89.5 percent of our Scope 1 \nemissions totals.
