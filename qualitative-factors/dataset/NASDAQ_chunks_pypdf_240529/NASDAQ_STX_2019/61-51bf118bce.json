{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY062 \nSeagate monitors water discharge quality \nat all facilities annually. Manufacturing \nsites and Seagate\u2019s largest R&D and \nadministrative sites are prioritized for  \nmonitoring because they are the largest \ncontributors to our water discharges. \nWe feel this prioritization of monitoring \nis appropriate because water discharge quality is monitored by standard \neffluent parameters at all facilities where \nwastewater treatment takes place on \nsite. Our remaining sites discharge \nto municipal sewers as per local \nrequirements and do not negatively \nimpact surrounding ecosystems.\nLooking Forward: Water Management \nWater is one of our most precious resources, and Seagate remains \ncommitted to reducing our use throughout FY2020. To achieve this, we \nwill continue to seek out new and innovative solutions, opportunities, and \ntechnologies, including assessing and monitoring our water usage data \nto determine best practices, approaches, and policies around our water \nmanagement.Water Withdrawals and Recycling Over 5 Calendar Years\nWater Withdrawals Water Recycling ML Withdrawals/EB\nCY14\nML Withdrawals/EBMegaliters\nCY15 CY16 CY17 CY1814,000\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n070\n60\n50\n40\n2030\n10\n0", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 61, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
