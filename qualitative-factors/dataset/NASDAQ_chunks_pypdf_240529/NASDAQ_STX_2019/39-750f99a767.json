{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY040 \nThe energy usage that Seagate incurs, \nand the process chemicals used, are \nessential in the manufacturing of our \nproducts and in providing our services. \nFor detailed information on our carbon \nemissions, please refer to our CDP  \ndisclosure . While the energy and process \nchemical use does contribute to GHG \nemissions, we work to reduce the amount \nof each by identifying energy conservation \nopportunities, auditing our management \nsystems, setting targets, and reporting our \nprogress to our employees, suppliers, and \ncustomers, both to create awareness and \nbe transparent. \nOur primary goal is to reduce energy use \nand GHG emissions per storage capacity \nproduced. These measurements are \nknown as \u201cenergy intensity\u201d and \u201cGHG \nemissions intensity,\u201d as they measure \nimpact relative to the amount of economic \nactivity taking place. Intensity is measured \nin various ways across industry sectors \nand product types; we measure energy \nand carbon emissions intensity per \nexabyte (EB) of storage capacity shipped. \nSeagate\u2019s largest sources of scope \n1 and 2 GHG emissions continue to \nbe purchased electricity and fugitive \nemissions (an unintended release of \nGHG compounds into the atmosphere from various types of equipment and \nprocesses). Each of our manufacturing \nsites is required to achieve annual energy \nsaving goals to help reduce the intensity \nof GHG emissions in our operations. \nReducing GHG emissions is the most \nsignificant environmental aspect in our \noperations, especially as new products \nchange production steps and usage \ntimeframes. As our industry transitions \nto increasingly cloud-based data storage \nsystems, there will be more cloud storage \nproduct offerings. These offerings \ntypically require longer test times, and \nrun for a longer time, increasing the GHG \nemissions per EB. \nThis transition undoubtedly will have \nan impact on our energy and carbon \nperformance, and we aim to better \nunderstand and mitigate any negative \nchanges. For example, we are \nworking to find a replacement for the \nhydrofluorocarbon (HFC) solvent used  \nin our manufacturing processes, which  \nis released as a fugitive emission, as  \nwell as any other chemicals that have  \nhigh global warming potential. These  \nare the main contributors to our  \nScope 1 emissions, and are key in \nreducing overall GHG emissions.Energy and Carbon Emissions Performance", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
