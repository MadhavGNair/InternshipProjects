{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY057 \n91.9 percent of hazardous waste \nproduced in FY2019 was recycled, with \n2.26 percent going to energy recovery, \n5.27 percent being incinerated, 0.52 \npercent being disposed of through \ntreatment processes, and 0.04 percent \nsent to landfills. Waste sent for landfill \ncontained asbestos from building \nrenovation as there we no other  \nsuitable treatment method available. \nOur hazardous waste disposition \ncontinues to shift away from treatment \nto recycling, with a larger percentage \nof our hazardous waste recycled this \nyear. Seagate generated 10 percent \nmore total hazardous waste in FY2019, \nincreasing from 8,457 tons in FY2018 to \n9,309 tons in FY2019. The increase was \ndue to the decision to ship more waste \noff site for treatment rather than treat it \nin house for business reasons. This also \ncorrelates with an increase in hazardous waste produced per EB shipped,  \nfrom 25 tons in FY2018 to 26.8 tons  \nin FY2019. \nWe utilize CHWMEG third-party audit \nreports to assess Treatment, Storage, \nand Disposal Facilities (TSDF) across \nglobal sites. When CHWMEG audit \nreports are not available, we directly \ncontract with third-party firms to \nconduct audits of TSDFs. In FY2019, \nwe conducted or reviewed 8 Hazardous \nWaste TSDF audit reports to ensure \nthese facilities meet the standards set \nby Seagate Corporate Sustainability. A \ntotal of 9,309 tons of hazardous waste \nwas transported to in-country TSDFs \nfor treatment in FY2019. No waste \nwas imported or exported during the \nyear. The volume of waste transported \nis calculated from hazardous waste \nconsignment notes that accompany  \nthe shipment for treatment.
