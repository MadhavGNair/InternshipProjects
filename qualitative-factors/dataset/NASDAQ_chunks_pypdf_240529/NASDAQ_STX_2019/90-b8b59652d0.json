{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT091 \nAiming to expand STEM activities in \nMinnesota, Seagate introduced robotics \nprograms into its mix of community \nengagement opportunities in CY2015. \nSince that time, support has grown \nsubstantially in terms of program scope, \nfinancial support, employee involvement, \nand number of students impacted. \nIn FY2019, robotics support included \nsponsoring a competition featuring three \nclasses of LEGO robotics teams\u2014First \nLEGO League, First Tech Challenge and \nFirst Robotics Competition. Seagate also \ninvested nearly 300 volunteer hours and \nfunded grants for six teams. Three of the \nteams won honors at the international \nFIRST Championship in Detroit, \nMichigan. Seagate also partnered with a \nMinneapolis school to create a practice \nfield for robotics teams\u2019 use, serving \n43 teams and more than 860 students. Throughout the season, Seagate\u2019s efforts \ntouched nearly 6,200 students and \ncountless parents and coaches. \nIn Colorado, Seagate supported several \nrobotics programs for about 90 middle- \nand high-school students who live in the \nnearby Casa de la Esperanza migrant \nfamily housing project. At the high-school \nlevel, three Seagate engineers served as \nmentors for Casa\u2019s FIRST Robotics team, \ndonating about 1,000 hours of volunteer \ntime during the year.\nMore than 60 Seagate volunteers in \nSilicon Valley, led by Seagate\u2019s CIO Ravi \nNaik, supported the Tech Challenge, \nan annual competition reaching more \nthan 2,400 students from grades 4-12. \nSmall teams of students, who had spent \nmonths building small model hovercraft, \ntested the devices on a challenging EXTENDING ACCESS TO HARD-TO-REACH AUDIENCES\nSupplementing Seagate\u2019s efforts to reach \nunderserved communities, additional work \nbegan in FY2019 to bring a technology \nexperience to even harder-to-reach stakeholders. \nThe Seagate team in Pune, India, engaged \nwith the National Association for the Welfare \nof the Physically Challenged (NAWPC), whose \nmission is to leverage technology to help build \nthe independence of the physically challenged. \nThe team donated funds to upgrade NAWPC\u2019s \ncomputer training lab that serves 50 visually \nchallenged students.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 90, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
