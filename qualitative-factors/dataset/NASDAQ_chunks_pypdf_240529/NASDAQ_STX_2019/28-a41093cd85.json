{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY029 \nBecause the vast majority of Seagate\u2019s \nproducts are sold as components to \nlarger systems produced by original \nequipment manufacturers (OEM) or \nresellers, we have minimal leverage  \nover how our products are managed  \nat the end of their useful life. Just  \nas we recycle our own internally \ngenerated scrap, we provide information \nto our customers to enable their own \nreclamation efforts and to promote \nparticipation in manufacturer take-back \nprograms. Seagate does not have a \nproduct take-back program since the \nvast majority of our products are sold  \nas components to larger systems. For our retail products and servers, \nSeagate helps to manage product \nwaste by taking back warranty-  \nreturned drives. All of these drives are \nrefurbished or recycled. Drives that  \nare recycled are done so at locations \nthat have been third-party audited to \nensure our environmental standards  \nare met. We also provide customers \nwith drive disassembly instructions  \nto facilitate recycling. In FY2019 we \nwere able to repair and redeploy 56 \npercent of the hard drives that were \nreceived via warranty returns through \nvarious channels.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
