{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY025 \nIn accordance with our credibility and \ntransparency efforts, the Seagate \nGreen Design models have achieved \na limited assurance verification by \nUL Environment based on criteria as \ndetailed in the International Standards \nfor LCA (ISO 14040 and ISO 14044), \nand the World Resources Institute \n(WRI) and World Business Council for \nSustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol \nProduct Life Cycle Accounting and \nReporting Standard. LCAs and \nproduct impact assessments help us \nfocus development efforts to reduce \nenvironmental impacts. We prioritize \nconducting product LCAs based on \nproduction volume and customer data \nrequirements.\nEach LCA addresses impacts at every stage in the product life cycle, \nfrom raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal and recycling. The \nSeagate Green Design Tool LCAs include four endpoints judged for \nparticular relevance to the electronics industry: \n1. Climate Change (kg CO2e)\u2014\nAssessed across the seven GHGs \nspecified in the GHG Protocol \nProduct Standard\n2. Human Toxicity (kg 1.4-DB \neq)\u2014Accounts for environmental \npersistence, accumulation in the \nhuman food chain, and human \ntoxicological effects3. Metal Depletion (kg Fe eq)\u2014\nIndicates the amount of mineral \ndeposits consumed\n4. Water Depletion (kg cubic \nmeters)\u2014Reflects the amount of \nwater withdrawn in cubic meters \nfrom local freshwater systems\nWe assess all of our products for \nhealth and safety, and improvements \nrelated to health and safety, through a \nrepresentative drive from each family \nof products, as well as for the overall \nproduct portfolio. We also assess the \nhealth and safety of our products to ensure compliance with regulatory \nstandards required to place products \nin our markets, as well as to meet legal \nrequirements. The progress that we \nhave made is published on our external \nwebsite.
