{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY049 \nCombining Scope 1 and Scope 2 \nemissions, Seagate generated 1,149,317 \nmetric tons of CO2e in CY2018, a 0.1 \npercent reduction from CY2017. We also  \nconducted third-party verification of  \nour GHG emissions reporting, which is \ndone every year per ISO 14064-3:  \nGreenhouse gases\u2014Part 3: Specification \nwith guidance for the validation and  \nverification of greenhouse gas assertions. \nOur CY2018 goal was to reduce our \ntotal combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 \nemissions by 2 percent from CY2017. This was not achieved. Our Scope 1 \nemission reduced by 1.2% in CY2018 \ncompared to CY2017 while our Scope \n2 emissions increased by 0.2%. Overall \nwe reduced our absolute emissions \nby 0.6% in CY2018 vs CY2017. If we \ncompare to our SBT goals, we have \nsome ways to go. We believe that \nmeasuring emissions normalized  \nover EBs shipped is a more accurate \nrepresentation of the emissions  \nportfolio of our business.
