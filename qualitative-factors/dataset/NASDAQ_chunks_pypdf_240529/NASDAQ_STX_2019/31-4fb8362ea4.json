{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY032 \nSeagate works hard to meet our \ncustomers\u2019 strictest specifications, and \nwe are meticulous about cataloging \nrestricted substances. This is important \nas these substances have been \nidentified to have a negative impact \non the environment, especially at \nthe end of product life. Policies and \nprocedures have been developed and \ncommunicated within the company \nand down the supply chain to ensure \nproduct environmental requirements \nare met. The program is managed by a \nproduct environmental function within \nthe Sustainability organization. We \ncurrently list more than 2,000 restricted \nsubstances in our database, and \nmaintain it to evaluate ongoing legal, \nindustry, and customer requirements \nfor product environmental compliance. \nWe also catalog the Chemical Abstract \nService number for each chemical \nsubstance present in Seagate \ncomponents and finished products. \nIn FY2019, we continued to add to our \nCompliance Assurance System (CAS) \nsystem based on supplier FMD and \nConflict Minerals data, including over \n22,000 active Seagate parts and 37,000 \nsupplier components. In FY2019 we \nresponded to more than 4,700 customer \nrequests for product environmental \ncompliance information. Seagate strives to comply with all \nregulatory requirements where we and \nour customers do business. Seagate \nadheres to global restricted substance \nlegislation, including the European \nRegulation regarding the Registration, \nEvaluation, Authorization and Restriction \nof Chemicals (REACH), and the \nRestriction of Hazardous Substances \n(RoHS) \u201cRecast\u201d Directive, as amended \nby Directive (EU) 2015/863. We monitor \nregulatory, industry, and customer \nrequirements, and continuously add \nnew chemicals and substances to our \nrestricted list, eliminating them from \nSeagate products wherever possible. \nA few updates of note occurred in \nFY2019 for REACH and RoHS. REACH \nadded 10 new substances to the \ncandidate list, bringing the total number \nof REACH substances to 201 as of July \n2019. All 201 substances are included \nin the Seagate Product Stewardship \nSpecification, meaning that Seagate\u2019s \nCAS system screens all product \ncomponents and materials for these \nsubstances. \nUsing Seagate\u2019s FMDs and CAS, we \nare able to determine if and where \nSubstances of Very High Concern \nare present in our products, and at \nwhat concentrations, both at the Restricted Substances ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
