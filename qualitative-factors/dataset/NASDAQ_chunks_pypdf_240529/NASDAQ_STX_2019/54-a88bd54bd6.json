{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY055 \nAt each Seagate site across our global \nfootprint, there are established systems \nthat track, manage, and report waste \nof all types. Our sites identify and \nimplement waste minimization initiatives \nwith the goal of preventing waste \nfrom being produced, and recycling \nor reusing waste whenever possible. \nThe site produces two main types of \nwaste; solid waste, comprised of wood, \npaper, cardboard and plastics which \nare non hazardous. The other type of \nwaste generated is hazardous waste \ncomprised of organic solvents, sludges, \ncorrosives waste and e-waste. Waste \nmanagement is a significant aspect of \nour operations as waste is inevitably \ngenerated in the manufacturing process and has to be properly managed to \nreduce the impact to the environment. \nPrograms are in place to properly \ncategorize these different waste streams  \nto ensure proper disposition in  \naccordance with regulatory requirements \nand generate the most benefit.  \nWe commit to zero landfill disposal of \nhazardous waste unless technically \nnot feasible. If disposal is needed, \nwe work with the disposal facility to \nidentify the most appropriate method for \ntreatment and disposal. Our preference \nis to recycle waste whenever possible, \nbut if that is not an option, we look at \nchemical, then physical treatment, and \nfinally incineration.
