{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nGOVERNANCE AND ETHICS019 \nProduct security is an important part of \nour commitment to Integrity, both for \nthe product itself and the data stored \non that product. In today\u2019s business \nenvironment, data creates value. Data \nis a vital business asset that needs to \nbe protected, which is why security \nanalysts recommend a complete range \nof protective solutions that includes both \nsoftware and hardware-based encryption. \nAlong with instant access and maximum \nstorage performance also comes the \nrealization that encrypting every bit of your \nbusiness data is the only viable service \nlevel. To provide that level of security to \nour customers, Seagate Secure offers \nEssential and Certified Data Protection \nto help protect the entire lifecycle of data security for business, government, and \nenterprise. In addition, to help protect \nthe data that our customers entrust to \nour hard drives, we have a feature called \nInstant Secure Erase (ISE), designed to \ninstantly reset the drive back to factory \nsettings and change the encryption key \nso that any data remaining on the drive \nis cryptographically erased. This ensures \nthat all data on the drive is permanently \nand instantly unreadable, extending \nthe life of the drive and enabling it to be \nreused. In this way, ISE also serves as a \nproduct sustainability feature since the \ndrives can be repurposed in a circular \neconomy, which extends the useful life of \nthe drive.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
