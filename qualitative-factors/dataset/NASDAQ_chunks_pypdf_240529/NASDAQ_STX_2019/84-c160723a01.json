{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nOUR EMPLOYEES085 \nLooking Forward: Employee Performance, \nLearning and Engagement\nIn FY2020 we will continue to focus on employee engagement and \nopportunities to grow our talent. We will continue to conduct our Micro \nSurveys, with a focus on encouraging conversations between managers and \nemployees. We plan to roll out a Management Essentials program that will \nbe focused on people managers\u2019 key areas of responsibilities to help them \nhire, grow, reward and engage their employees. We will also expand our \nOrganization Talent Review (OTR) and succession process to look deeper \ninto the organization for talent. All managers will play a role in assessing, \ndiscussing and developing talent across Seagate to ensure business \ncontinuity and performance.Our employees are our greatest \nresource, and we value their feedback \nand perspective. For more than three \nyears, we have conducted our employee \nMicro Survey biannually to measure our \nemployee\u2019s perceptions of their jobs, \nthe company, and the extent to which \nthey feel supported. Understanding this \ninformation allows the company to have \ninsight into our employee\u2019s perspectives, \nwhich are used to address potential \nimprovement opportunities. In previous \nyears, our Micro Survey was sent to \nnon-operator employees, and in FY2019, \nthe survey was opened up to operator \nemployees as well. These employees could use their mobile devices to scan a \nQR code to easily complete the survey. \nOverall, more than 39,000 employees \nwere invited to complete the survey and \nwe received 95 percent participation. \nAnd, just as in years past, all responses \nare anonymous so employees can freely \nrespond and share their feedback. \nOnce the survey concludes and results \nare analyzed, they are then shared \nwith leaders, and managers have \nconversations with their teams to develop \ntargeted action plans. Overall, we continue \nto see improvements in our results, most \nsignificantly in the areas of engagement \nand belonging.
