Our Conflict Minerals Policy \nStatement is available on our website . \nCurrently 72 percent of known 3TG \nsmelters and refiners are validated as \nconflict-free. Seagate continues to seek \nsupplier commitments to source only \nconflict-free 3TG, and to have their \nsmelters and refiners engage in the \nvalidation audit process. If smelters  \nand refiners decline to become conflict-\nfree, we advocate for suppliers to \nconvert to other preferred sources. \nSeagate\u2019s hardware products contain \nall four conflict minerals, all of which \nare required for functionality and \nproduction. Our company purchases \nparts, components, materials, and \nsubassemblies that contain these \nmetals. Information about the origin  \nof the 3TG contained in these items \ncomes from our direct suppliers,  \nfrom both lower-tier suppliers and  \nour membership in the RBA and RMI. \nWe currently extend our due diligence \nbeyond what is required by law, and \nmap the origins of cobalt in our supply \nchain, making us one of the first \ncompanies to undertake this endeavor. \nSince cobalt is also mined in the DRC, \nthe supply chain is exposed to similar \nrisks as 3TG. We use the Cobalt \nReporting Template (CRT) from  \nthe Responsible Minerals Initiative \n(released in late December 2018) to  map the source of all the cobalt in \nour supply chain. This provides a \nstandardized mechanism by which to \nshare cobalt-sourcing data throughout \nthe supply chain. \nSeagate has used the CRT to gather \ncobalt-sourcing information from all of \nour in-scope direct material suppliers \n(in-scope = top 99.5 percent of spend \non direct material suppliers providing \ncobalt-containing parts). Seagate \nhas made available by request to our \ncustomers sourcing information for  \nover 99 percent of cobalt-containing \nparts from in-scope suppliers.\nSeagate did not conduct an IPSA  \naudit of our Conflict Minerals program  \nin FY2019. This audit was conducted \nand passed in FY2017, and will again  \nbe conducted in early CY2020. Although \nan IPSA was not conducted in FY2019, \nwe maintained our commitment to the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development (OECD) due diligence \nframework. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
