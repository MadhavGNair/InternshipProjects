{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY023 \nThis is important to us as product \nenergy use is a major contributor to our \nScope 3  emissions, while the material \nthat we use to build our products has \nto be mined and processed, creating \nenvironmental and social impact. These \nimpacts are identified by our Life Cycle \nAssessments (LCAs), an analysis of \nenvironmental impacts over a product\u2019s \nlife cycle from raw material extraction \nthrough end-of-life. Our Product \nSustainability team works closely with \nboth internal and external partners \nto assess and reduce our overall \nenvironmental impact, and manage \nany trade-offs. Our LCAs include \ninformation on product environmental \nimpacts, throughout the life cycle of  \nthe product, covering four specific \nimpacts in total. \nSeagate\u2019s holistic view of product \nimpacts looks at the environment, our \ncustomers, suppliers, and communities \nwhich are affected by our products \nand/or operations. Maximizing our \nsustainability is an ongoing goal for  our Product Sustainability program, and \nis an effort we are proud to partake in. \nThe well-being of our planet depends \non those responsible for any impacts \nto constantly consider how they can \ndo better for the world, and the people \nin it. By knowing the impacts of our \nproducts, and then working to reduce \nor eliminate those impacts, Seagate \nhopes to be a good global citizen. \nSeagate thus is also better equipped to \nsupport our customers in meeting their \nenvironmental objectives. \nIn FY2019, Seagate\u2019s Product Compliance \nCouncil continued to operate according \nto its charter, supporting aspects of our \nproduct sustainability. All of Seagate\u2019s \nproducts meet regulatory requirements \nfor health and safety in all jurisdictions \nwhere we do business, and we have \nhad zero incidents of non-compliance \nwithin the reporting period. Additionally, \nSeagate does not have any of its \nproducts or services banned in any \nmarkets where we do business.PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY \nOVERVIEW\nReducing the impact that our products and packaging have on the \nenvironment is extremely important, as each piece of technology we  \nmake and ship pulls on different resources from around the world.
