{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY026 \nMaterials Efficiency and Circularity\nOne of Seagate\u2019s sustainability goals \nis to make better use of our materials, \nand create a circular economy for our \nproducts. With projects involving internal \nand external stakeholders, and tools \nwithin the company, we are making \nimportant progress in this area.\nWith the Seagate Green Design tool,  \nwe are including a circularity metric  \non each product LCA. Circularity is  \na measure of materials efficiency. \nMaterial use has traditionally been  \nlinear: virgin materials are taken from \nnature, used to make and use products, \nand ultimately proceed to disposal. A  \ncircular economy promotes the continuous \nuse of materials in order to reduce \nwaste and minimize our reliance on  \nfinite virgin resources. \nSeagate now measures the circularity  \nof products using the Material Circularity \nIndicator (MCI) for those products \nassessed via the Seagate Green Design \nTool. We do this to benchmark our \nproducts, identify opportunities for \nimprovement, and to move toward \ngreater material efficiency. We also do \nthis to inform our data storage solutions \ndesigns and add value to the way we \nserve our customers and partners. The MCI focuses on the restoration of \nmaterial flows at product and company \nlevels, and is based on the following \nfour principles: using feedstocks from \nreused or recycled sources, reusing \ncomponents or recycling materials \nafter each use of the product, keeping \nproducts in use longer (e.g., by reuse \nor remanufacture), and making more \nintensive use of products (e.g. via \nservice or performance models). MCI \ncombines these measures of circularity \ninto a single indicator. \nA perfect score is one, or 100 percent \nrestorative, while a score of zero \nindicates a product with average \nlifespan and functionality, no recycled or \nreused content, and with no prospect of \nbeing recycled or reused at end of life. \nOur LCAs, which include a circularity \nscore for each product, are publicly \navailable on the Global Citizenship \npage of our website for each product \non which Seagate has completed ISO \n14040/14044 LCA studies.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
