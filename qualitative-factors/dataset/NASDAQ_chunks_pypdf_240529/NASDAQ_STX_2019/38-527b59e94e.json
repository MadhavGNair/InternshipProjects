{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY039 \nSeagate understands and acknowledges \nthat climate change is contributed \nto by human activity, and will lead to \na number of social, economic, and \nenvironmental consequences for all \nof us if not properly dealt with. As a \ncompany, we are committed to setting \ngoals and tracking our progress, \nas well as auditing our systems to \nreduce energy consumption, carbon \nemissions, waste, and water usage \nthroughout our global footprint. All \nefforts in these areas are fully supported \nby senior management. Our global \nenvironmental sustainability efforts are a part of Seagate\u2019s values, policies, and \nprocesses, and are tied intrinsically to \nhow we do business. To the best of \nour knowledge, none of our operations \nare located in or adjacent to protected \nareas and areas of high biodiversity value \noutside protected areas. \nWe work closely with our suppliers and \nprovide training to key stakeholders to \neducate them on sustainability best \npractices, with indicators to gauge \nperformance. These actions comprise \nthe majority of our environmental \nsustainability efforts.ENVIRONMENTAL \nSUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW\nOur environmental management  \nsystem is shaped by ISO standards, \nthe RBA Code of Conduct, and UNGC \nprinciples. By managing and reducing \nenvironmental impacts through this \nsystem, Seagate demonstrates our \nrecognized environmental sustainability \nleadership in our industry. \nAt the end of FY2019, all of Seagate\u2019s \nmanufacturing facilities were certified to \nISO 14001 Environmental Management \nSystem and working towards ISO 45001  \nOccupational Health and Safety, upgraded \nfrom Occupational Health and Safety \nAssessment Series (OHSAS) 18001. We had 26 environmental regulatory visits, \nand 38 health and safety and fire  \nregulatory visits globally in FY2019. These  \nresulted in one violation notice for \nwastewater discharge exceeding limits in \nSingapore. Seagate took corrective action, \nincluding controlling and decreasing the \nregeneration waste discharge, diverting \nit to a regeneration waste tank for pre-\nneutralization, installing a pump with lower  \ncapacity to lower the flow rate of the \nneutralization system, and monitoring \nconductivity online with the option to divert  \nany off-specification waste for further \ntreatment. The fine paid totaled $750.Management Systems", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 38, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
