{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY054 \nLooking Forward: Energy and Carbon Emissions\nSeagate will continue to focus on energy conservation throughout FY2020 \nand beyond, continuously evaluating our processes to identify savings \nopportunities throughout our global footprint. We will also continue to work \ntowards ISO50001 certification at all manufacturing sites. Seagate will \ncontinue to work on reducing our emissions through energy conservation \nactivities, improved management of energy, and process controls. In \naddition, we will continue to work toward achieving our approved, aggressive \nSBTi goals.In CY2018, there were no ozone-\ndepleting substances (ODS) recognized \nunder the Montreal Protocol used for \nproduction. However, there was a total \nof 0.008 metric tons of CFC eq used in \ntest and development. This data was \nbased on in-house annual chemical \ninventory based on their relative ozone depletion potential (ODP). Based \non available air monitoring results, \nsignificant air emissions concentration \nfrom our manufacturing facilities were \n0.25 mg/Nm3 NOx, 0.004 mg/Nm3 \nSOx, 262 mg/Nm3 volatile organic \ncompounds (VOC) and 5.3 mg/Nm3 \nparticulate matter (PM).CY2018 Emissions of Ozone Depleting Substances, \nand Nitrogen Oxides, Sulfur Oxides and Other \nSignificant Air Emissions", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 53, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
