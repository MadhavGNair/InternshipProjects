{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY060 \nSeagate\u2019s primary consumption uses \nof water are for cooling and irrigation, \nboth of which we monitor at our \nfacilities annually. For facilities where \nactual data is not available, we estimate \nconsumptive use based on available \ndata from other facilities. Manufacturing \nsites and Seagate\u2019s largest R&D and \nadministrative sites are prioritized for \nmonitoring because they are the largest \ncontributors to our water use. For \nsmaller office-based sites, consumption \nis negligible.\nTreatment and disposal of wastewater \nfrom our processes is an important \naspect of our operations. In all \nlocations in which we operate there \nare minimum standards set for the \nquality of effluent discharge set by \nthe local authority which include pH, \nBiological Oxygen Demand, Chemical \nOxygen Demand, Suspended Solids \nand mineral content among others. \nOur treatment plants are built and \nmaintained to ensure they operate \nefficiently in treating the effluents from our processes. All our treatment plants \nhave internal operating control limits \nset well below the minimum discharge \nstandards to act as internal triggers \nto ensure continued compliance. A \nnumber of our facilities also have on-\nline monitoring capabilities which are \nlinked directly to the regulatory authority \nmonitoring system. The regulatory \nauthority which provides us with the \npermits to operate our treatment plants \nand set effluent discharge limits do \ntake into consideration the receiving \nbodies of water, for example, at our \nJohor, Malaysia plant, we need to \nmeet the stricter Standard A effluent \ndischarge standard. Seagate took \ncorrective action, including controlling \nand decreasing the regeneration waste \ndischarge, diverting it to a regeneration \nwaste tank for pre-neutralization, \ninstalling a pump with lower capacity to \nlower the flow rate of the neutralization \nsystem, and monitoring conductivity \nonline with the option to divert any off-\nspecification waste for further treatment. \nThe fine paid totaled $750.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 59, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
