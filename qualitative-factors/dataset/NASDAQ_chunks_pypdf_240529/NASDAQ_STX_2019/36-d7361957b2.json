{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY037 \nAdditional information and details are available in our \nConflict Minerals Report , filed annually with the U.S. SEC.Throughout FY2019, we continued to \nmanage supplier communication and  \ndata via CAS, following our implementation \nof the system in FY2017. \nFor the Conflict Minerals reporting period \nwhich closed midway through FY2019 \n(January 1, 2018 through December \n31, 2018), Conflict Minerals Reporting \nTemplates were collected from 100 \npercent of our in-scope suppliers. Of  \nthe direct materials suppliers that Seagate purchases parts containing 3TG from, \nthe list of suppliers that amounts for 99.5 \npercent of spend is defined as the in-\nscope suppliers. For the reporting period, \nthere were two smelters identified as \npossibly being part of our supply chain \nwhich had not demonstrated through the \nResponsible Minerals Assurance Process \n(or equivalent audit) to be conflict-free. \nThus for CY2019, Seagate is unable to \nassert that our entire supply chain is \nconflict-free.\nLooking Forward: Responsible Sourcing of Minerals\nSeagate will remain committed and vigilant against human rights violations \nthroughout our supply chain and with associated smelters. As we plan to \nconduct an IPSA in FY2020, we continue toward our vision of conflict-free \ncertification across our entire product portfolio.
