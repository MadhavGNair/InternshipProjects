{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY030 \nCASE STUDY:  \nMAGNET ASSEMBLY \u2018 VCMA \u2019 \nCIRCULARITY DEMONSTRATION\nIn FY2019, Seagate participated in \nPhase 2 of the iNEMI Consortium \nValue Recovery project , focused on \nHDD magnet materials and component \nrecovery. HDD magnets, or magnet \nassemblies, were targeted due to the \nimportance of Rare Earth Elements \n(REE\u2019s) or Rare Earth Metals (RE metals) \nas constituent material in magnets. RE \nmetals are critical in many high-tech \nproducts, with increasing demand. \nREE recycling is seen as a priority for \nall tech companies, not just within the HDD industry, as a means of mitigating \nsupply chain risk and also of reducing \nenvironmental impacts of REE mining \nand processing.\nIn one of five demonstrations in the \nproject, Seagate partnered with Teleplan \nInternational and a Seagate OEM \ncustomer to successfully recover VCMA \nmagnet assemblies from end-of-use \ndrives, and use the sub-assemblies in \nnew drive builds. \n \n\u2022 Feasibility of VCMA sub-assembly \nreclamation, with ability to build \ninto new drives (with same \nspecifications and warranty \nas drives built with new VCMA \nassemblies)\n\u2022 Opportunity to identify the process \nand supply chain innovation \nnecessary to be able to bring \nVCMA circular processes to scale\n\u2022 Cost of reclaim processing at \nscale may be cost neutral or, with \ndevelopment, slightly cost-positive, \ncompared to normal component \nand drive build processes\u2022 LCA analysis quantifying \nenvironmental gains for the VCMA \nreclaim/reuse process compared \nto virgin material use showed \nemissions savings representing \n96 percent of the global warming \nimpact of one virgin VCMA set \n(one top and one bottom)\n\u2022 Feasibility of circularity at \ncomponent or sub-assembly level \nwas demonstrated as a preferred \npath to materials recovery onlyThe importance of this demonstration included:", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
