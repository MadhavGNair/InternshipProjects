{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY028 \nIn FY2019, we completed eight  \nLCAs and reported the results using  \nour updated Product Sustainability \nReport format. In accordance with  \nour commitment to credibility, this  \nprocess maintains third-party assurance. \nSignificant environmental impacts \ncome from the use phase of Seagate \nproducts. This means one of the largest \nopportunities to reduce product impacts \ncomes from customers\u2019 understanding \nand use of Seagate\u2019s product power \nconservation modes, which allow \ncustomers to reduce the costs associated \nwith drive operation while also reducing \nenvironmental impacts. The advantages \nof these power conservation modes are \ndescribed in the product manuals. \nSeagate does not stipulate post-consumer  \ncontent when procuring components or \nparts from suppliers; however, it must \nbe acknowledged that there is post-\nconsumer material inherent in today\u2019s \nraw material supply. Utilizing data from \nour LCAs, we are able to determine the \nimpact of metal depletion per terabyte (TB) of storage capacity shipped on \naverage for our product portfolio. The \nmetal depletion indicator specifies \nthe amount of mineral deposits that \nare consumed to provide the end-use \nmaterial in question. The process is \nnormalized to the extraction of iron (kg \nFe-Eq). The average metal depletion per \nTB across Seagate\u2019s product portfolio \nis 1.40 kg Fe-Eq, and the total CY2018 \nimpact to metal depletion equates \nto 2.0 million tons of Fe-Eq. In order \nto be more accurate, in line with our \nmethodology, we are reporting in a CY \nbased time frame for metal depletion. \nSeagate takes the entire product life \ncycle into account when designing our \nproducts. Most Seagate products are \nhighly recyclable, containing aluminum, \nsteel, copper, and other recoverable \nmaterials, and many regions where \nSeagate products are sold have \nelectronic waste recycling programs.  \nFor this reason, our HDDs are prime \ntargets for salvage and recycling.
