{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nSUPPLY CHAIN095 \nSeagate's supply chain program ensures \nthat people are treated fairly and \nresources are managed responsibly. \nWe do this through education, strategic \nmanagement, and a commitment \nto transparency with our thousands \nof suppliers, consultants, and \nmanufacturers around the world. \nSeagate has two categories of suppliers: \ndirect and indirect. Direct suppliers are \nthose that provide components and \nparts of our products, while indirect  \nsuppliers provide products and services  \nthat support our operations. To align with \nthe RBA Code of Conduct, our Supply \nChain and Global Citizenship programs \nhave four aspects spanning Code, \nCapacity Building, Risk Assessment, and  \nRemedy. The RBA Code of Conduct \nalso serves as the code of conduct for our suppliers. Our expectation is that \n100 percent of suppliers will comply \nwith this code of conduct.\nMultiple trainings are conducted, either \ndirectly with suppliers or by leveraging \ntools provided to us by the RBA. Using \nthe Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) \nand Validated Audit Program (VAP) as \nprimary risk assessment tools, we are  \nable to determine if any non conformance \nto the Code occurs, and if so, obtain \nroot cause and corrective action plans. \nThe RBA Closure Audit is our preferred \noption when verifying successful \nclosure of audit findings, and our \nrequirements are documented in our \nCSOP. Supplier performance in audits \nand closure findings are scored in the \nQuarterly Supplier Scorecard for the \naffected supplier(s). SUPPLY CHAIN OVERVIEW\nAs a global company with diverse operations, our success is dependent \non our ability to be agile and act swiftly in meeting customer and market \ndemands. This strategic position is not possible without the Seagate \nemployees and our community of partners that comprise our global \nsupply chain.
