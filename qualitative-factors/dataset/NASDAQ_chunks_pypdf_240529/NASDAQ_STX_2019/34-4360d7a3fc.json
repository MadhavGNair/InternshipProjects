{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nPRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY035 \nA continual challenge for companies \ninvolved in hardware industries is the \nsourcing of conflict-free minerals. \nDefined as tin, tungsten, tantalum, \nand gold (3TG), these minerals are \ncommonly mined in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo (DRC) and \nadjoining countries. Some of these \nminerals are illegally sourced and traded \nby armed groups who are responsible \nfor human rights violations. The Dodd-\nFrank Act, Section 1502, adopted in \nthe United States in 2010, requires \ncompanies to disclose if any 3TG used \nin their products originated in the DRC or an adjoining country. If so, any and  \nall efforts undertaken by the company  \nto ensure the sources of these metals \nare documented, identified, and reported \nto the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC). \nIn complying with this regulation, and \nworking to ensure the minerals in our \nsupply chain are responsibly sourced, \nSeagate participates in the RBA \nResponsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), \nwhich allows us to contribute to industry \nsolutions while maintaining standard \nprocesses for data collection. Note that \nSeagate does not directly source any of Responsible Sourcing of Minerals\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2019.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
