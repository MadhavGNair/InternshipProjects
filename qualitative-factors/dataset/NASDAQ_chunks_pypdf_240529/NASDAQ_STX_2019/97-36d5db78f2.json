{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nSUPPLY CHAIN098 \nSupply Chain Due Diligence\nAll identified suppliers are required  \nto update their SAQs annually. In \nFY2019, 159 suppliers either completed \nor updated their SAQ and released  \nthe SAQ via the RBA-ONLINE system. \nAll existing suppliers, and 100 percent \nof new suppliers identified in the  \nscope of our policy, are screened \nannually. We also aim to align our \nsuppliers with the latest RBA Code of \nConduct revision updates, Conflict-Free \nMineral development plan, and RBA \nenvironmental questionnaire. \nSeagate requires all of our direct \nmaterials suppliers with whom we \nspend at least $1 million annually, as \nwell as selected indirect suppliers, to \nundergo the RBA VAP audit process. \nDoing so helps to ensure integrity and \nverify conformance with the code of \nconduct. These audit reports are valid \nfor two years, meaning our suppliers \nare on a two-year audit cycle. We \ncompleted 75 full supplier audits \nthrough the RBA VAP in FY2019,  \nup from 63 in FY2018. In FY2019, 10 percent of audited \nsuppliers received Platinum Level \nrecognition, meaning they achieved full \nscores in the initial VAP audit. These \nrecognitions show our ongoing efforts \nto engage with our suppliers, providing \neducation and ensuring they have the \nnecessary means to be compliant. \nIn FY2019, 32 supplier closure audits \nwere conducted. The objective of \nthese audits was to ensure that \nsuppliers who were previously found \nto be noncompliant have implemented \nmeasures to correct any violations \nidentified in the initial VAP audit. If \nsuppliers are unable to close the \nfindings, we work to reduce the level of \nseverity, and then track closure rates. \nSeagate tracks \u201cpriority\u201d and \u201cmajor\u201d \nfinding closure rates in addition to \nSAQ and VAP completion. At the end \nof FY2019, the closure rate of non-\nworking-hour findings was 79 percent; \nthe closure rate of working-hour \nfindings was 68 percent.
