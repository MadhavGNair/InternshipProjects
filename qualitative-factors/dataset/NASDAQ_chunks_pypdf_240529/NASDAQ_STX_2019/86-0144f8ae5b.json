{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT087 \nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \nOVERVIEW\nSeagate\u2019s community engagement program puts our corporate \nvalues into action in support of education and well-being. In FY2019, \nSeagate offered community engagement opportunities at its major \nlocations (500 or more employees), comprising 96 percent of our \nworkforce. Our stakeholders include employees, local community \nmembers, nonprofit partners, civic and academic institutions, and \ngovernments. \nOur goal was for 50 percent of our \nengagements to be in Science, \nTechnology, Engineering and Math \n(STEM) education. We ended FY2019 \nat 40 percent, reflecting an increased \nnumber of local Health and Human \nServices engagements at a number \nof our sites. \nSeagate volunteers logged approximately \n20,000 community engagement hours. \nWe reached more than 53,000 young \npeople with a range of direct learning \nexperiences, from hands-on workshops \nto educational exhibitions. This level of \nreach was driven by several large-scale \nengagements occurring in FY2019 in \nthe U.S. and Thailand, and an increased \ncommunity focus in Springtown, Northern Ireland, aligning with that \nlocation\u2019s 25th anniversary. Additionally, \nan estimated 58,000 more individuals \nwere exposed to Seagate\u2019s brand \nindirectly through event sponsorship \nlogotypes and collateral. \n\u2022 In Johor, Malaysia, Seagate \norganized a visit to Hospital Sultan \nIsmail\u2019s Pediatric Palliative Care \nCenter. Seagate\u2019s volunteers got \neveryone moving by teaching  \nsome fun dance steps to the \nchildren, and a colorful clown also \nbrought a healthy dose of magic \ntricks and balloon animals. The  \nday concluded with cake and party \npacks for the kids.
