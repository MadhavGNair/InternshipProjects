{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nGOVERNANCE AND ETHICS018 \nWe continually reevaluate our policies to \nconfirm that they reflect and adhere to \nprevailing standards, requirements, laws, \nand regulations at the local, national, and \ninternational levels. The Board reviews  \nour compliance and ethics program, \nincluding our key policies and processes \nrelated to ethical business conduct, on \nan annual basis to ensure that Seagate \ncontinues to operate within the letter and \nspirit of the law.   \nThrough our RBA membership \ncommitment, 100 percent of our \nmanufacturing sites undergo a risk \nassessment every two years. In \nFY2019, there were no significant \nrisks of corruption identified through \nany risk assessment among our seven \nmanufacturing sites, which together \ncomprise nearly 86 percent of our  \nglobal footprint. \nWe are committed to protecting all data \nwithin Seagate, including the personal \ninformation of our employees and \ncustomers, and other data that is shared \nwith or received by third parties. We \ncontinue to comply with the European \nUnion (EU) General Data Protection \nRegulation (GDPR) as we work toward \ncompliance with other emerging data \nprotection and privacy laws worldwide, \nincluding the California Consumer Privacy \nAct of 2018 (CCPA) and the Thailand \nPersonal Data Protection Act (effective \nMay 27, 2020).Our global privacy program has adopted \nthe principles of the EU General Data \nProtection Regulation (GDPR) and the Fair \nInformation Practice Principles (FIPPS) \nas the foundation for our comprehensive \nand holistic global privacy program. FIPPS \nincludes the principles of accountability; \nacting within the law; informing individuals \nof how their data will be used; only using \ndata for a specific purpose; collecting only \nthe minimum data necessary, and not \nkeeping the data longer than is necessary \nto fulfill its purpose, and are widely \naccepted concepts for fair information \npractices and data protection. Through \ncross-functional collaboration, we \ncontinue to build on this foundation and \nto honor the privacy rights that have been \ngranted to individuals.  \nTo further Seagate\u2019s commitment to \nsafeguarding data, we launched an \ninternal data protection program that \nevaluates the data lifecycle\u2014including \nhow data is created, stored, used,  \nshared, archived, and destroyed\u2014  \nwithin Seagate. We are implementing \nadditional policies, processes, and \ntechnologies to sufficiently protect \nSeagate\u2019s data and our partners\u2019 data \nfrom corruption, compromise, and \nloss. We aim to strike the right balance \nbetween the productivity required for \nsmooth business operations and the \nsecurity controls necessary for effective \ndata protection.
