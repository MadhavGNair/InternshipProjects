{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY059 \nWater is an extremely important \nnatural resource, and requires proper \nmanagement to preserve and protect \nthe health of our global ecosystems. \nOur manufacturing processes use \nwater from local watersheds which \nare shared with the local community. \nThe primary use of freshwater in our \ndirect operations and our value chain \nis as coolants and cleaning agents \nat production facilities. Additionally, \nfreshwater is important for employee \nconsumption and sanitation. Water \nmanagement was deemed a significant \naspect due to its direct and indirect use \nbecause without water, we could not \nclean products during manufacturing \nor provide adequate cooling to facilities \nand critical equipment. Additionally \nwaste water produced from our \noperations is treated and discharged \ninto waterways used for other purposes \ne.g. transportation, irrigation. Thus \nthe proper treatment of water in an \nimportant aspect of our operations \nto reduce the impact to downstream \nactivities. In the last few years, Seagate \nhas applied measures to reduce water consumption, improve water recycling, \nincrease awareness among employees, \nand reduce water intensity. Our water \nmetrics are reported annually based on \nthe calendar year, not fiscal year. \nWe reduced total water withdrawn by \n8.5 percent, from 8,875 megaliters \nin CY2017 to 8,282 megaliters in \nCY2018. This is the total volume of \nwater withdrawn from municipal water \nsupplies based on meter reading. In \nCY2018 we recycled 2,556 megaliters \nof water, up from 2,291 in CY2017, a \n12 percent increase based on meter \nreading. Our progress has been driven \nby reducing water use through more \nefficient processes, and recycling the \nwater we use. In CY2018, our water \nintensity (ML withdrawals/EB) was 22.59 \nliters per EB, down from 31.1 liters per \nEB in CY2017, a 27 percent decrease. \nThis is due to an overall reduction in \nwithdrawal as well as the increased \nnumber of EBs shipped from CY2017 \nfrom CY2018. The CDP Response \nfor Water  and Third Party Verification  \ncan be found on our external Global \nCitizenship website.
