{"page_content": "FY2019 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nSUPPLY CHAIN097 \nlegislation passed in July 2017, and \naims to restrict the use of North Korean \nworkers in U.S. companies\u2019 supply \nchains. Seagate obtained 115 letters of \ndeclaration from its suppliers indicating \ncompliance to CAATSA in FY2019. \nSeagate is proud to have a continued \nmajor role in the RBA, with one of \nour senior vice presidents serving on \nthe RBA Board of Directors and the \nexecutive committee/Senior Leadership \nCouncil. In the last few years, Seagate \nhelped lead the Assessments Workgroup, \nand participated in other workgroups. \nHaving an active presence in the RBA \nhelps Seagate be a better global citizen, \nand also provides the opportunity to \nwork with peers to drive improvements \nin the supply chain.\nThrough audits and reports from non-\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) in FY2019, Seagate was made aware of \nthree cases of high recruitment fees \ninvolving foreign workers at supplier \nfacilities in Malaysia. During the year, we  \nworked with the RBA and other customers \nof these suppliers to confirm the \nallegations and quantify the amount  \nof fees involved. In all three cases, the  \nfees were being collected in the home \ncountry. Identification of recruitment fees, \nespecially in a worker\u2019s home country,  \nhas been extremely challenging, but is \nvery important in protecting workers \nin our supply chain, and maintaining \nintegrity as a company. We continue to \nwork closely with the RBA and other \ncustomers to address this issue. \nWe also continued our work with a \nsupplier in Thailand that was identified in \nFY2018 as having additional recruitment \nfees. We will continue to ensure that the \nworkers are being recruited fairly.
