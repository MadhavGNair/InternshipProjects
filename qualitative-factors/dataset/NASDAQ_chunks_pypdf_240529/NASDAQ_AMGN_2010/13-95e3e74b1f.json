{"page_content": "14 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportWaste: \n moving from recycling to reduction (continued)\nBiopharmaceutical paper trail \ntakes an electronic path\nBringing biotechnology medicines from the research \nlaboratory to patients takes many years\u201415 on \naverage\u2014and a countless number of scientists and \nstaff members  . In the past, careful documentation \nof every step\u2014from the laboratory bench, to clinical \ntesting, to quality control in manufacturing\u2014meant \nthat drug development traditionally required millions  \nof pieces of paper  . \nThanks in large part to dramatic improvements in \ninformation management technology implemented \nat Amgen in recent years, we\u2019ve been able to replace \na number of paper documents associated with \ndeveloping medicines\u2014such as laboratory notebooks, \nclinical study documentation, maintenance records, \nand filings with drug approval agencies\u2014with \npaperless, electronic tools and processes  . Changes \nlike these helped Amgen reduce its paper use \nby nearly half\u201453 million sheets\u2014from 2007 \nthrough 2010  .Since 2007, Amgen has recycled more than 16,000 metric tons (MT) \nof waste, which represents approximately 3,200 garbage trucks full \nof recyclables  . Amgen now recycles paper, plastic, metal, cardboard, \nglass, and wood at our facilities and is composting food and landscaping \nwaste at more than 70 percent of facilities  . Many of our facilities are also donating used equipment and materials, \nwhich contributes to our recycling efforts  . With staff participation, our \nrecycling rate improved by 53 percent from 2007 through 2010  .\nWe use the waste hierarchy pyramid, which illustrates sustainable management of waste, as a model for maturing our waste management \nprogram  . As shown in the chart above, right, which includes routine hazardous and non-hazardous waste, since 2007 the percentage of \nwaste we send for disposal has steadily decreased, while the percentage of waste that we recycle has progressively increased  . While our \nefforts to reduce our waste have also improved since our baseline year, we are working to move our company solidly into the upper level of \nthe waste hierarchy\u2014waste reduction\u2014by improving processes and changing our work culture to use fewer materials overall  .Routine waste by waste hierarchy category (MT) The waste hierarchy as a model for our waste-reduction goals\n80%\n20%60%\n0%50%70%\n10%90%\n30%100%\n40%\n2007 2008 2009 2010\nDisposal Energy recovery \nfrom incinerationRecycling, composting, \nreuseReduction*More sustainable\nLess sustainableReduction\nRecycling, composting, reuse\nEnergy recovery \nfrom incineration\nDisposal8964,039\n4,533 4,758\n769\n6347723,546250 360 435\n5,704\n4,0273,5423,582\n*Value represents year-over-year, cumulative reductions  .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
