{"page_content": "11 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportOur carbon dioxide performance\nUnderstanding our carbon dioxide ( CO2) emissions is critical to \nreducing our impact on the environment  . We know that changes in \nour energy use impact our CO2 emissions  . To better understand our \nScopes 1 and 2* CO2 emissions, we completed a carbon inventory in \n2010  . Using the World Resources Institute\u2019s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) \nProtocol, we confirmed that CO2 is our primary GHG of concern, \nconstituting approximately 98 percent\u2020 of our emissions  . Through \nthis inventory, we also analyzed the sources of our CO2 to better \nunderstand the relationship of our energy use to our CO2 emissions  . \nAs shown in the chart below, close to three-quarters of our CO2 \nemissions are the result of our purchased indirect energy being \nmainly sourced from fossil fuels  . Energy sources of purchased \nelectricity vary by region  .Energy and carbon dioxide: \n  understanding our carbon footprint (continued)\n2007\u20132010 CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions avoided\u2021 \nthrough conservation efforts (1,000 MT)\n2010 CO2 emissions\u2014Scope 1 and Scope 2\u2014by source (1,000 MT)\n200400\n100\n0300500\nTotal CO2 emissionsScope 1 sources\n Natural gas\n Diesel\n Propane\nScope 2 sources\n Electricity\n SteamCO2 emissions avoided\u2021 through conservation efforts16\n389 41339\n41046\n406Preparing for potential climate change\nEven though we are doing our part to help mitigate \nclimate change, we realize we must plan for its \npotential risks  . Through participation in the Carbon \nDisclosure Project , we have identified potential risks \nto our business in the form of extreme weather \nevents, water scarcity, and increasing regulation  . \nImplementing plans to mitigate those risks gives \nus an opportunity to become a stronger, more \nsustainable business  . We monitor carbon \nregulations and proactively prepare for them  . \nOur water conservation efforts are helping us find \nnew ways to reduce our water use  . If a significant \nnatural disaster, such as a hurricane, were to occur \nat a manufacturing facility, it could potentially affect \nthe supply of medicines to our patients  . To prepare \nfor such a risk, we\u2019ve put mitigation measures in \nplace through business continuity planning  .\n*Definition can be found in Notes for summary of data on page 25  .\n\u2020Remaining percentage contains: methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, and de minimis \namounts of perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride  .

For example, in 2009 we expanded operations at a facility \nwhere the majority of electricity is generated from fossil fuels . As a \nresult, we saw a slight increase in our CO2 emissions . In 2010, our \nCO2 emissions remained flat as a result of our energy reduction in \nspite of increased operations . We look for opportunities throughout  \nthe company to reduce CO2, in combination with energy reduction, \nto counterbalance any increases due to growth in our business  .\nThe Scope 3* CO2 emissions we collect from commercial business \ntravel by our staff, which are not included here, can be found in the \nSummary of data table at the end of this report  . In the future, we plan \nto expand our inventory to include additional Scope 3 CO2 emissions, \nsuch as those from our outsourced activities  .2785 288\n15", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
