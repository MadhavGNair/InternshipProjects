{"page_content": "19 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportAt Amgen, our staff members are our most important resource  . \nWe are committed to creating an environment that encourages \nand enables staff members to stay healthy and safe  .\nOur culture of safety \nAmgen maintains a safety record that is among the very best in \nour industry, or any industry  . \nOur safety record is supported by a culture that encourages staff to \ndo the right thing and to feel empowered to report and correct any \nsafety incidents or unsafe conditions and behaviors they observe  . \nTo enhance this culture, we have put in place a risk management \nprogram that focuses on the highest potential safety risks to staff \nin our manufacturing, research and development, and distribution \nfacilities . We started by identifying and prioritizing tasks with significant, \ninherent risk\u2014such as working at heights, with chemicals, or with \npressurized systems\u2014and then conducted comprehensive risk \nassessments  . Finally, we implemented control measures to minimize \nthe risk  . We regularly conduct follow-up inspections to ensure that \naccurate procedures are in place, staff members are trained, and \nsafety controls are used appropriately  . This program, combined with the culture of safety we have created, \nhas resulted in decreased injuries to our staff  . Further contributing \nto our culture is increased awareness among our staff members \nto recognize and report unsafe conditions and behaviors  . Through \nproactively identifying and correcting unsafe conditions and \nbehaviors, we create a safer environment at work, as evidenced \nin the charts below  .\nSafety metrics 2007 2008 2009 2010\nInjury and illness* rate\u20200 .82 0 .76 0 .55 0 .56\nLost day case rate\u20210 .25 0 .28 0 .19 0 .17Our greatest resource \nIt\u2019s about people, not numbers\nStaff members at Amgen are aware that a safety \nincident is not just a data point on a chart: It \nrepresents a fellow staff member being injured  . \nOur culture requires that staff members be vigilant \nabout their own safety as well as the safety of \nothers around them  . This is true whether preparing \nfor activities such as working at heights or just \nwalking down the hall  . Working together, we \nensure that safety remains one of our fundamental, \ncore practices  .\nAbove: Facilities staff members help each other \nassemble fall protection equipment as they prepare \nto work near the edge of a roof at Amgen\u2019s \nThousand Oaks, California, facility.2007\u20132010 Injuries and illnesses* decrease overall \nas reports of unsafe conditions and behaviors increase\n4,000200\n2,000100\n1,00050\n0 03,0001507,000\n6,000\n5,000Reported unsafe conditions Injuries and illnesses*\n2007 2008 2009 2010\nReported and corrected unsafe \nconditions and behaviorsReported injuries \nand illnesses*\n*Injuries and illnesses beyond first aid  .\n\u2020Rate based on number of injuries and illnesses per one hundred staff members  .\n\u2021Rate based on number of injury and illness cases with days away from work per one hundred \nstaff members  .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
