{"page_content": "10 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability Report\nOur energy performance\nEnergy is important to the manufacture of our vital medicines  . \nOptimizing its use reduces our overall impact on the environment \nand increases the efficiency of our business  .\nReducing our energy use also impacts our carbon dioxide (CO2) \nemissions, as these emissions are directly related to the amount \nand type of energy we use in our operations  .\nTo identify opportunities for reducing energy, we have focused on \nbetter understanding how we use energy  . We have classified our \ndirect energy usage and resulting Scope 1* CO2 emissions, and \nour indirect energy usage and resulting Scope 2* CO2 emissions, \nin alignment with the World Resources Institute\u2019s Greenhouse \nGas (GHG) Protocol  .\nThe sources of direct energy are the diesel, natural gas, and propane \nwe use in boilers and generators at our facilities  . Our indirect energy, \nwhich we purchase in the form of electricity and steam, is generated \nfrom a variety of energy types, as illustrated in the pie chart, to the \nright . The pie chart also shows that the amounts of energy we use \nfor direct and indirect energy are about equal  .\nOur overall trend in energy use over the past four years is downward, \nas shown in the data chart at right  . We achieved this result despite \nincreased operations in 2009 and 2010  . Our energy conservation \nprojects and resulting efficiencies have mitigated the effect of increased \nenergy use due to our growth in operations and have allowed us to meet \nour 2012 energy reduction target ahead of schedule .Energy and carbon dioxide: \n  understanding our carbon footprint (continued)\nConservation success is shared \nacross the company\nA change in ventilation practices that yielded \nsubstantial energy savings at our facility in \nWashington is just one example of how the Amgen \nSustainability and Utilities Network process has \nhelped us achieve progress in energy reduction  . \nBased on traditional engineering practices, the \nventilation systems in the laboratories of our Seattle \nfacility operated in occupied mode at all hours of \nthe day  . Since laboratory space has specialized \nventilation requirements, this was a costly practice  . \nEngineering staff suspected there was a more \nefficient way to ventilate these spaces and installed \nnew instrumentation that could safely regulate \nventilation when spaces were either occupied or \nunoccupied  . Since 2009, each year the facility \nconserves approximately 53,000 gigajoules (GJ) \nof energy, reduces 3,400 metric tons of CO2, and \nsaves $450,000  . Through the efforts of our utility \nnetworks, Amgen has applied this approach at \nthree other facilities, realizing similar reduction rates  . \nAbove: Donald, a senior engineer, helped implement \nthe energy-saving ventilation project at Amgen\u2019s Seattle, \nWashington facility.2007\u20132010 Energy use and energy use avoided\u2020 \nthrough conservation efforts (1,000 GJ)\n2,0004,000\n1,000\n03,0005,000\nEnergy use Energy use avoided\u2020 through conservation efforts2007 2008 2009 2010229\n4,019 4,341 4,006520\n3,9162010 Energy use\u2014Direct and Indirect\u2014by source (1,000 GJ)\nDirect sources\n Natural gas\n Diesel\n Propane\nIndirect sources\n Fossil fuel\n Hydro\n Nuclear\n  Nonspecified \nrenewables\n Nonspecified1,522252\n372200\n111492\n1,454\n436\n*Definition can be found in Notes for summary of data on page 25  .\u2020Value represents year-over-year, cumulative avoidance  .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
