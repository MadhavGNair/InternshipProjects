{"page_content": "16 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportOur plan aims to build environmental sustainability considerations \ninto our processes and facilities from the beginning\u2014to conserve \nresources, increase efficiency, and lower costs  . As we integrate this \nprinciple in a more comprehensive and systematic way through our \nDesign for Environment program, we are confident that it will help \nto make us a better, stronger company in the years to come  .\nGreen products and processes\nIn 2010, we established a Green Products and Processes program with \nthe goal of integrating environmental sustainability into the development \nlife cycles of our products, from research through delivery to patients  . \nThis program contains three pillars: Green Chemistry, Green Biology, \nand Green Packaging  . Research staff members have developed Green \nChemistry teams to incorporate guidelines and approaches that reduce \nthe environmental footprint of our processes during the development \ncycle of our small-molecule medicines (see sidebar) . We have created a \nteam to drive similar considerations for our large-molecule medicines \ndevelopment processes through a Green Biology program . Additionally, \nthrough our Green Packaging program, we are starting to look at how our \nproducts are packaged, and we are considering more environmentally \nsustainable approaches . In 2010, we established a process to integrate \ngreen considerations into new package designs, evaluated our existing \nproduct packaging designs, and prioritized areas where we can make \nour packaging more environmentally sustainable .Designing sustainable facilities \nAnother element of the Design for Environment aspect of our \nenvironmental sustainability plan is our Sustainable Design and \nConstruction program  . This program provides guidelines for major \nremodeling projects as well as new facility construction  . We apply \nthis practice, which incorporates industry-standard green principles \nsuch as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) \nguidelines  to new projects in design and execution stages  . Through \nthe practice, we consider how to remodel and build construction \nprojects with the optimal conservation performance over the entire \nlife span of the structure  . This practice lessens the impact of our \nbuildings on the environment, saves money, and can also create \na pleasant work atmosphere for staff members  .Sustaining our business \nGreen chemistry: safer chemistry, \nreduced energy, higher efficiency\nJust like an architect can design a building to have \ncleaner air quality and use fewer resources, scientists \ncan create chemical processes that are better for the \nenvironment and conserve resources when they\u2019re \ndeveloping small-molecule medicines  . This more \nenvironmentally friendly approach to chemical \nprocess development is called green chemistry  . \nIn 2010, Amgen began a Green Chemistry program \nin selected research areas  . With this heightened \nenvironmental awareness, Amgen scientists have \nbeen finding ways to use safer chemicals, less \nenergy, and more efficient practices  . Although our \nwork in this area is just beginning, Amgen scientists \nhave already made significant progress  . Through \nefforts to achieve both sustainability and scientific \ninnovation, Amgen\u2019s Green Chemistry program can \nreap rewards for the environment while supporting \nAmgen\u2019s overall mission to serve patients  .\nAbove: John, a Green Chemistry team leader in Small \nMolecule Product and Process Development, is a \npublished author of leading articles in green chemistry.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
