{"page_content": "8 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportOur conservation targets \nSetting and achieving conservation targets \nare key components of our commitment to \nenvironmental sustainability  . In 2008 we \nidentified energy and carbon dioxide, water, \nwaste, and the fuel efficiency of our U  .S . \nsales fleet as target areas where reductions \nand conservation efforts could make the \ngreatest impact  . \nTo measure our progress, we track the results \nof projects and initiatives against a 2007 \nbaseline  . In order to be transparent about \nour environmental sustainability efforts, we \ncount only projects and initiatives where we \nhave confirmed our results through a formal \nmeasurement process  . Results that arise \nfrom changes in our business outside these \nprojects and initiatives are not counted toward \nour targets  .\nIn the areas in which we have already \nachieved our targets, we continue our \nefforts  . We focus on identifying projects \nand initiatives with a shared value of \ndecreasing our environmental impact and \nincreasing the efficiency of our business  .Waste\nFuel efficiencyImprove U  .S . fleet vehicle \nfuel efficiency by 4 miles \nper gallon (MPG)* to \n23 MPG by 2012\n*23 percent of 2007 baselineRecyclingRecycle greater than or \nequal to 40 percent of \nroutine non-hazardous \nwaste* by 2012\n*2007 rate was 38 percent\nReduce 700 metric tons \nof routinely generated \nwaste* by 2012\n*7 percent of 2007 baselineEnergyConserve 500,000 \ngigajoules (GJ) of \nenergy* by 2012\n*12 percent of 2007 baseline\nWaterConserve 235,000 \ncubic meters (m3) \nof water* by 2012\n*7 percent of 2007 baselineCarbon dioxideReduce 75,000 \nmetric tons (MT) \nof CO2* by 2012\n*18 percent of 2007 baselineResults of conservation projects through 2010 2012 Target\nReduction to date: 520,000 GJTarget = 500,000 GJ\nTarget met\nTarget = 75,000 MT\nReduction to date: 46,000 MT62 percent \nof target met\u2020\nTarget = 700 MT\nReduction to date: 435 MT62 percent \nof target met\nTarget = 4 MPG\nImprovement to date: 3 MPG75 percent \nof target metTarget = 235,000 m3\nReduction to date: 616,000 m3Target met\nTarget \u2265 40 percent\nRecycling rate to date: 58.5 percent Target met\n\u2020Small discrepancies in data are due to rounding  .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
