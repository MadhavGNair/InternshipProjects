{"page_content": "12 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportWater is a precious resource that is vital to our biotechnology \nenterprise  . Amgen uses thousands of cubic meters of water annually \nto investigate potential new medicines and to manufacture our \nmarketed products  . In our laboratories, scientists rely on water\u2019s \nunique chemical properties as a solvent, a reagent, or even a \ncatalyst to perform experiments leading to discovery of molecules as \nmedicines  . Manufacturing staff count on specialized purified water, \ncalled water for injection (WFI), to both manufacture and prepare \nour biologic medicines for patient use  . We use water to cool utility \nequipment, clean our process equipment, and support our staff \nmembers through their workdays  . \nOur water performance\nWater is critical not only to our business, but also to the communities \nin which we operate  . Therefore, we continuously challenge ourselves \nto find new ways to conserve it  . At selected facilities, we have built \nand developed water recycling facilities and features, installed \nwaterless urinals, planted low-impact landscaping, and optimized \nwater purification processes  . Through our Sustainability and Utilities \nNetwork, we pilot water conservation projects and incorporate them \nat all facilities where the projects make the greatest difference  . \nIn 2010, we conducted a water inventory to better understand water \nuse at our facilities . As part of this inventory, we found that the majority \nof the water we use, approximately 2,564 thousand cubic meters \n(TCM), comes from municipal sources, while a much smaller portion, \n14 TCM, comes from groundwater . The inventory allows us to identify \nthe best opportunities to conserve water and reduce our impact on \nlocal water sources . Beginning in 2008, our water use, or intake, has shown an overall \ndownward trend (see water intake chart below)  . This decrease is \nalmost entirely the result of water conservation projects such as smart \nirrigation controls and reuse of process water in boilers and cooling \ntowers . These projects, along with the success of our efforts in \nPuerto Rico (see sidebar), are the main reasons that we have \nalready exceeded our 2012 water conservation target  . \nEven though we have exceeded our target earlier than expected, \nwe continue to identify and implement ways to further conserve \nwater and increase our awareness of the long-term availability and \nlocal concerns surrounding the water we use  .Water: \n conserving a vital resource\nSending water back to work \ninstead of down the drain\nAt our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico, we use \nhundreds of cubic meters of water annually to cool \nutility plant equipment  . Thanks to the state-of-the-\nart water treatment plant Amgen built at this location, \nthe facility now reuses almost 75 percent of the \nwastewater it generates, sending this water back  \nto work to cool equipment, instead of down the \ndrain  . This wastewater treatment plant was built \nto comply with water discharge permit limits and \nto accommodate fluctuations in manufacturing, \nbut also provides a secondary benefit of water \nconservation  . The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer \nAuthority has recognized Amgen for our water \nrecycling achievements, which contribute to the \nisland\u2019s overall goals for water conservation  . \nAbove (left to right): Neftali, a senior associate; Ana, \na senior maintenance manager; and Edgar, a senior \nmaintenance technician, display pretreated and treated \nwater samples in the water treatment plant at Amgen\u2019s \nfacility in Puerto Rico. The treated water is reused \non-site to cool equipment.2007\u20132010 Water intake and intake avoided* through \nconservation efforts (1,000 m3)\n2,0003,000\n1,000\n500\n01,5002,5003,500\nWater intake Water intake avoided* through conservation efforts2007 2008 2009 2010571\n2,536567\n2,738 3,286616\n2,577\n*Value represents year-over-year, cumulative avoidance  .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
