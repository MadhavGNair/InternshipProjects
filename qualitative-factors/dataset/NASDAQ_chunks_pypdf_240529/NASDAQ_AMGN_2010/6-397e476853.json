{"page_content": "7 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportAt the core of managing our impact on the environment is the \ngathering of reliable, meaningful data on our performance  . In \naccomplishing this work, we face the challenges of understanding \nand measuring the effects of our conservation progress within the \ncontext of our ever-changing business  . \nTying our progress to specific actions\nWe made the choice to tie reporting of our conservation progress to \nspecific projects and initiatives that conserve resources and reduce \nenvironmental impact  . The results of these projects and initiatives \ncount toward achieving our targets  . This approach helps distinguish \nbetween the results of the efforts we make to reduce our impact \non the environment and the results that occur from changes in our \nbusiness, such as changes in our production rates  . \nMeasuring our environmental impact\nIn addition to reporting on our progress toward meeting our \nconservation targets, we also measure and report on our overall \nenergy and carbon dioxide, water, waste, and U  .S . sales fleet fuel \nefficiency performance data  . For reporting on both target progress \nand overall environmental performance, we include data from our \n13 major manufacturing, research and development, and distribution \nfacilities in North America, Europe, and Puerto Rico  . \nOn the following pages, we illustrate areas where we have avoided \nusing resources or creating emissions as a result of our conservation \nefforts in the context of our absolute performance data  . In some cases, \nour projects and initiatives offset our business growth so that we \nreduced impact overall, even as our business expanded  .Our focus on compliance \nNo picture of our impact on the environment would be complete \nwithout addressing our compliance record . At Amgen, we are committed \nto operating in compliance with regulatory requirements at all times  . \nWe routinely perform internal audits at our facilities, including our \nmanufacturing, research and development, and distribution facilities  . \nWe share the reports and action plans from audits across our global \nnetwork to make sure appropriate corrective actions are implemented \nat all applicable locations, not just where the audit was performed  . \nIn addition, we have established an environment, health, and \nsafety (EHS) management system, which provides a framework for \ndocumenting and continually improving our EHS programs through \nroutine assessments  .\nWhen deviations from regulatory requirements occur, Amgen is \ncommitted to taking timely and appropriate corrective actions  . In \n2010, Amgen received three environmental notices of violation as \na result of 89 regulatory inspections  . These notices were primarily \nin the area of wastewater management  . None of these resulted in \nmonetary fines, and all have since been corrected  .Our impact on \n  the environment \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
