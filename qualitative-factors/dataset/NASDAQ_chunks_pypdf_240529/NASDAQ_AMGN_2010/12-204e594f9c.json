{"page_content": "13 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportWaste:  \n moving from recycling to reduction \nOur strong culture of recycling \nand waste reduction\nOur staff members have stepped up to the challenge \nof a \u201cless-waste\u201d mind-set  . We are building a culture \nwhere people think twice before printing a page, \nusing disposable utensils, or tossing recyclables in \nthe trash  . Amgen facilities in the United Kingdom \nwere early adopters of a practice to forgo desk-side \ntrash bins and increase use of central recycling \nand composting stations, a practice that helped \nour facility in Cambridge achieve a diversion rate \nof nearly 90 percent in 2010  . Some of our facilities \nin Colorado, California, and Puerto Rico also \nimplemented this method and other practices, and \nare achieving individual recycling rates of 65 percent \nor better  . Staff-based environmental sustainability \nteams have made a difference, encouraging staff \nto adopt reusable coffee mugs and dishes, cut back \non paper use, and compost their coffee grounds, \namong other green practices  . Company-wide, in \n2010, we recycled 58  .5 percent of our waste that \nwould otherwise have gone to a landfill  .As a company that includes scientific research and development, \nmanufacturing operations, and administrative functions, Amgen \ngenerates a variety of waste that we handle with great consideration \nfor the environment  . Beyond our careful attention to disposal and \nminimization of hazardous waste, we take action to recycle and \nreduce our non-hazardous waste  . We have installed user-friendly \nrecycling stations at our facilities and implemented composting \nprograms where supported by local municipalities  . \nKnowing that the ultimate intent of our waste target is to avoid \ngenerating waste in the first place, we are shifting our efforts to \nwaste reduction to move our program further up the waste hierarchy \n(see graphic and chart on page 14)  . Waste reduction has the greatest \npotential to decrease our environmental footprint  . \nOur waste reduction and recycling performance\nThe more we know about the types of waste we generate, the more \nwe can target specific waste for recycling and reduction  . Through \nrefined data analysis, we have classified over 40 categories of waste  . \nThe largest category of our non-hazardous waste is administrative \nwaste, which includes items we routinely generate such as paper, \ngeneral trash, and packaging material  . As shown in the chart at right, \nto a lesser extent, we generate hazardous waste, which consists \nmainly of chemical wastes, and is managed according to local, state \nand federal regulations  . We also generate waste from construction \nactivities on a nonroutine basis  .* Generation of administrative waste is variable and depends on the \nnumber of Amgen staff members and the extent of our current \noperations  . In 2010 our operations increased, resulting in greater \nwaste generation, as seen in the chart below  . Even though operations \nhave increased, we\u2019ve achieved administrative waste reductions \nthrough both targeted initiatives and operational improvements  . \nFor example, we reduced the cardboard waste at our Louisville \nDistribution Center in 2008 by nearly 80 metric tons (MT) through \nimprovements in product distribution  . We continue investigating our \nadministrative waste to learn more about sources of waste generation \nand to identify greater reduction opportunities for the company  .\n*Our nonroutine waste data, which is mainly construction waste that is sent to landfills, is not \nincluded in this section, but may be found in the Summary of data table on page 23  .\u2020Routine waste is generated in the normal course of doing business  .2007\u20132010 Routine\u2020 waste generated (MT)\n8,000\n4,000\n2,000\n06,00010,00012,000\nHazardous Non-hazardous20097,706\n1,004\n20087,770\n1,065\n20107,933\n1,180\n20078,803\n1,343", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
