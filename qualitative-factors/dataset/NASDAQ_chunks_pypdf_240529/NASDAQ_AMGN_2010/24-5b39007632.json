{"page_content": "25 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportNotes for summary of data\nGeneral\na Amgen has included data from 13 facilities for energy and carbon dioxide, water, and waste  . These facilities represent approximately 93 percent of Amgen\u2019s worldwide \nfacility space based on total square feet  . Included facilities are in Thousand Oaks, California U  .S .; Greenwich, Rhode Island U  .S .; Boulder and Longmont, Colorado U  .S .; \nSeattle and Bothell, Washington U  .S .; Juncos, Puerto Rico U  .S .; Louisville, Kentucky U  .S .; South San Francisco, California U  .S .; Fremont, California U  .S .; Cambridge, \nMassachusetts U  .S .; Burnaby, Canada; Breda, Netherlands; Uxbridge and Cambridge, United Kingdom  . This includes leased buildings where we have operational control \nover building infrastructure, including utilities  .\nb Measurement and verification of conservation and reduction projects for energy and carbon dioxide, water, and waste are based on the adaptation of the International \nPerformance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings Volume 1, EVO 10000-1  .2007, April 2007  . \nProject measurements are conducted using reasonable means, including direct measurements and scientific estimations as appropriate  .\nEnergy\nc Direct energy use results from operating equipment that is owned or controlled by Amgen at the facilities listed in note (a)  . Data on the use of natural gas, propane, and \ndiesel in boilers, furnaces, and HVAC are recorded from utility bills  . Data on the use of diesel in emergency generators are recorded from purchase records or meter \nreadings and, in some cases, estimated from run-hours  . Utility bills recorded in units of volume are converted to energy by using the Global Reporting Initiative Version 3  .0, \nEN3 table, to convert volumes of primary sources (natural gas, diesel), and the U  .S . Energy Information Administration/Annual Energy Review Table A1 (propane)  . Energy \nfrom emergency generators recorded as run-hours is estimated using the manufacturer\u2019s specified fuel-feed rate for each generator  .\nd Indirect energy use results from purchased energy in the form of electricity and steam at the Amgen facilities listed in note (a)  . Data on the use of electricity and steam is \nrecorded from utility bills  . Utility bills for purchased steam that are recorded in units of mass (i  .e ., \u2018lb steam\u2019) are converted to energy by using the latent heat of evaporation \nfrom the saturated steam tables, then dividing by the efficiency of the supplier\u2019s steam generator  .\nCarbon dioxide\ne Scope 1 CO2 emissions result from direct energy sources defined in note (c)  . CO2 emissions from our U  .S . sales fleet and executive air fleet are found in the Other Carbon \nDioxide category in this data summary  . CO2 data from direct energy sources are calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector \nTools\u2014Stationary Combustion\u2014V  .1 .0 (Jul 2009)  . Scope 1 emissions that are not included in this data summary include fugitive emissions from chillers, coolers, and \nHVAC, as well as process-related emissions from cell respiration (CO2 as a by-product) and pH adjustments (CO2 injection)  . Analysis of these sources in 2009 showed \nthat our fugitive emissions are less than 1 percent of the total carbon emissions when compared with other sources such as energy use and that cell respiration and \nemissions from pH adjustments are negligible (less than 0  .1 percent of our total CO2 emissions)  .\nf Scope 2 CO2 emissions result from indirect energy sources defined in note (d)  . CO2 data from purchased electricity are calculated using emission factors from U  .S . EPA \neGRID2007 Version 1  .1 (2005 data: eGRID subregion annual CO2 output emission rate) for all U  .S . locations (eGrid2007 HICC subregional factor is applied to Amgen \nPuerto Rico), from the Greenhouse Gas Division, Environment Canada (2006 data)\u2014V  .1 .0 (April 2009) for Amgen\u2019s Facility in Burnaby, Canada, and from specific utility \nprovider\u2019s annual reports for Amgen facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge and Cambridge) and the Netherlands (Breda)  . CO2 data from purchased steam are \ncalculated using the Emission Factor for Natural Gas as identified in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools\u2014Stationary Combustion\u2014V  .1 .0 (Jul 2009)  .
