{"page_content": "9 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability Report\nFacing the future challenges brought about by both climate change \nand the finite reserves of fossil fuels will require a global effort involving \nmany industries .  For its part, Amgen has set energy and carbon dioxide \n(CO2) targets and has identified opportunities for reduced environmental \nimpact and increased efficiency in operations  . We have implemented \nmany conservation projects across the company, from large-scale \ncapital projects, to small-scale projects at individual facilities  . An \nimportant contribution to our progress is our ability to actively share \nknowledge gained from these projects across our company  .\nEnergy and CO2 projects and resulting benefits 2008\u20132010\nConservation \nprojectsEnergy \nsavings* \n(1,000 GJ)CO2 \nsavings* \n(1,000 MT)Cost \nsavings* \n($1,000)\nCentral utilities \nefficiencies72 7 1,190\nBuilding HVAC\u2020 \nefficiencies232 24 3,941\nLighting changes 7 1 218\nProcess, building, \nand equipment \nefficiencies209 14 3,713\nTotal 520 46 9,062\n*Savings realized in 2010 are from projects implemented 2008 through 2010  .\n\u2020Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning  .To reduce our energy use and CO2 emissions, Amgen takes a \nsystematic, science-based approach\u2014asking questions, testing \nhypotheses, and sharing knowledge  . The Amgen Sustainability and \nUtilities Network (SUN), along with our Global Utilities Network (GUN), \nmanages energy and CO2 reduction projects and evaluates their \nfeasibility by executing pilot efforts to prove the concept  . When \nsuccessful, projects are implemented globally, and the company \nbenefits from the shared sustainability expertise .  In 2010 alone, the \nSUN supported $4  .1 million worth of projects that were executed \nby our facilities  . These 2010 projects are estimated to result in \nenergy savings of 84,000 gigajoules and a CO2 reduction of 7,000 \nmetric tons (MT)  .
