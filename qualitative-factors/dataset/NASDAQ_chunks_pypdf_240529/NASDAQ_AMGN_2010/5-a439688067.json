{"page_content": "6 Amgen 2010 Environmental Sustainability ReportOur report reflects the efforts of the multiyear environmental \nsustainability plan that we have been implementing to reduce our \nenvironmental impact  . In line with our values as a business grounded \nin research, our environmental sustainability plan is science based \nand data driven  . We have found that advances we make to benefit \nthe environment provide a shared value in helping us to be a more \nefficient and cost-effective company  . Our plan is based on achieving \nfour objectives: measure and reduce our environmental impact, build \na culture of environmental awareness, sustain our business, and \ncommunicate our results  . \nMeasure and reduce our environmental impact\nWe established 2012 targets against a 2007 baseline to help focus \nour conservation efforts and reduce our environmental impact  . We \nhave been implementing projects to help us achieve our targets for \nenergy and carbon dioxide, water, waste, and our U  .S . sales fleet \nvehicle fuel efficiency  . We have already met our water, energy, and \nwaste (recycling) targets, and are on track to meet our remaining \nconservation targets  . To assist in tracking our progress toward these \ntargets, and to improve our collection and analysis of environmental \nperformance data, we launched a new, online data management \nsystem in 2010 (see sidebar) .\nBuild a culture of environmental awareness\nAmgen staff members are creating a culture of environmental awareness \nas they engage in recycling initiatives, energy conservation efforts, \nvolunteering for local cleanups, environmental education, and other \nactivities that support Amgen goals for environmental sustainability  . \nThe efforts and enthusiasm of staff members contribute to our maturing \nenterprise-wide approach to environmental sustainability  .Sustain our business\nOur Design for Environment program includes initiatives we are \ndeveloping in order to use environmental sustainability practices from \nthe outset in multiple areas of our business  . These initiatives include \nthe Green Products and Processes program, which is beginning to \nincorporate environmentally friendly practices in product development \nfrom research stages through delivery of medicines, and the Sustainable \nDesign and Construction program, which sets standards for making our \nfacilities greener and more efficient, in line with our business goals . \nCommunicate our results\nWe have engaged with internal stakeholders to help shape our \nenvironmental sustainability plan . We have gathered feedback externally \nfrom healthcare professionals, patient opinion leaders, policy leaders \nand financial leaders we\u2019ve identified as being key opinion drivers \nfor stakeholder expectations of Amgen as part of the qualitative and \nquantitative research we periodically undertake  . Our plan addresses \nstakeholders\u2019 views that we should operate in an environmentally \nsustainable manner and reduce our use of natural resources  . As \nwe progress, we intend to take a broader, more deliberate approach \nto identifying and consulting with additional internal and external \nstakeholders to help improve our plan and how we report our results .\nAn Environmental Sustainability Council, with representation from \nleaders across the company, guides our plan, in alignment with \nour business, and reports our progress up through our executive \nleadership to the Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee, \na sub-committee of our Board of Directors  . The Board of Directors \nconsists of 12 members, including Chairman and Chief Executive \nOfficer Kevin Sharer  .

This system is \npart of the essential infrastructure we needed to \ninstall in order to report on our progress  . This new \ndata system provides greater functionality than our \nprevious system, which utilized multiple spreadsheets, \nand allows us to better assess and analyze our \nenvironmental impact  . Supporting documents for data \ncollection, such as utility bills, are also collected \nin the system, which provides confirmation for the \nreported data  . Our enhanced ability to analyze data \nis helping us to better target conservation areas \nand plan future projects  .\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2010.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
