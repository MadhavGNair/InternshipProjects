While supporting STEM programs, we also recog-\nnize the role of a strong academic foundation in preparing the technological leaders of tomorrow.\nBecause reading on grade level is a critical indicator of future academic success, Applied invests in programs focused on \nincreasing early literacy and access to books.

In \nShanghai, the Applied Materials Future Science Star competition attracts hundreds of teens from across the city to design \ninnovative science projects. In Israel, Applied ensures that the Ofanim science bus delivers hands-on science learning to \nchildren living in remote areas of the country.  \nIn select cities in the U.S., Applied continued its long-term education initiative targeting student achievement in tradition-\nally underserved neighborhoods. Detailed information on the progress of this fifteen-year effort in San Jose, California and \nAustin, T exas is available in the 2016 Education Initiative Report.\nThe T ech Awards, presented by Applied Materials and a program of the T ech \nMuseum of Innovation, paid tribute to the 294 innovators recognized during the first 15 years of the global awards program.
