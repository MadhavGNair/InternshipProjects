We are committed to complying with or exceeding all applicable regulatory requirements. \nOur EHS Management System aligns and integrates with our site business processes and incorporates formal risk assessments and \nmitigation practices validated by routine internal audits and periodic third-party audits of our certified manufacturing sites. The EHS Management System includes safety self-inspections, walkthroughs, safety review board meetings and committees, training and new chemical approvals, among other ongoing activities. \nAlzenau, Germany and Rehovot, Israel were both registered to OHSAS 18001 during 2016. Applied\u2019s certification roadmap includes registration \nof three additional global manufacturing sites: Kalispell, Montana; Gloucester, Massachusetts; and Heimstetten, Germany. All non-registered sites utilize the same elements of the EHS Management System to align with appropriate environmental, health and safety practices globally.\nThe table below details the Company\u2019s safety performance metrics for the past three fiscal years. We improved safety results from 2015 to \n2016 through continued efforts and management focus on EHS. However, the Company received one notice of violation in T aiwan in 2016, resulting from a lack of safety coordination meetings with contractors and suppliers at the Applied Materials T aiwan Hsinchu offices, as required by T aiwan Occupational Safety and Health laws. This issue was quickly mitigated by Applied EHS staff.\nApplied Materials OHSAS 18001 \nManufacturing Sites: \n \u00bbAustin, T exas\n \u00bbSanta Clara, California  \n(New Product Integration)\n \u00bbSingapore \n \u00bbRehovot, Israel \n \u00bbT ainan, T aiwan\n \u00bbAlzenau, Germany", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2016.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
