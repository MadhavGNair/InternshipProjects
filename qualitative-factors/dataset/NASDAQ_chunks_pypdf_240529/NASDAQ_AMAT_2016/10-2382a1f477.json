The decrease in non-hazardous waste is the result of implementing additional \nrecycling programs that enabled improved diversion rates. Among the factors contributing to the increase in hazardous \nwaste was higher production rates of manufacturing equipment and an increase in research and development activities. \nWhile periods of strong business demand can sometimes necessitate greater use of hazardous materials, Applied remains \ncommitted to responsibly monitoring all our waste streams and working to minimize the use of hazardous materials to the best of our ability.\nApplied\u2019s offices, campuses and manufacturing facilities globally implement recycling programs to decrease non-hazardous \nwaste generation and increase waste diversion. The total amount of hazardous waste or nonhazardous waste generated \ndepends on fluctuations and changes in business volumes, facility system or process improvements and the use of enhanced \nmaterials controls and management. \nActivities currently in place to minimize waste production include recycling of solid materials, cafeteria items and building \nmaterials, as well as creation of reusable packaging for shipping and other uses. 2016 WASTE REDUCTION\nLandfill\n30%\nRecycled/composted/diverted\nDiversion rate12%\n78%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2016.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
