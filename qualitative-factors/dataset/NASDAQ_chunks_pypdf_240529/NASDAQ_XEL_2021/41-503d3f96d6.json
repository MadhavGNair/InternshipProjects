It covers all environmental media, including air, water, land, waste and \nbiodiversity, and sets expectations that align business practices with our commitment.\nThrough our corporate strategy and daily operations, we aim to achieve environmental excellence and seek \nto demonstrate leadership by doing what is right and advancing initiatives that benefit the environment.  \nWe also balance our environmental commitment with our obligation to provide customers reliable, \naffordable energy.\nIn making decisions, we consider opportunities to reduce emissions, eliminate waste and conserve or \nprotect resources, such as water and wildlife. We also monitor our operations, and if appropriate, make \nimprovements that further environmental excellence. Often, we participate in environmental research and \nstewardship projects or partnerships in our communities.\nWe have more than 40 policies, procedures and guidance documents that support our ongoing \nenvironmental performance and foster environmental excellence.
