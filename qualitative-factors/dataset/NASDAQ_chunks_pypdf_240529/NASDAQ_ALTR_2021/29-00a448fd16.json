{"page_content": "Practices Overview People Products Planet\nProducts: \nAltair Sustainability Report  /  30\nOperational Efficiency\nOur HPC technology empowers customers to \noptimize utilization across all dimensions of \ntheir compute infrastructure, and take energy efficiency a step further with green provisioning \nand power-aware job scheduling. We also support \nadditive manufacturing and other advanced manufacturing techniques that help users create \ncost-effective, optimal designs developed and \npowered by AI and machine learning.\nMaterial Efficiency\nEngineered plastics and laminate composites \noffer the design freedom to meet lightweighting \nand cost requirements for complex parts.Users can produce high-quality plastic materials quickly and at high volume, but holistic simulation  \ngives them the power to tailor materials to \nindividual product requirements. We offer \na comprehensive set of engineering plastic solutions to produce innovative plastic parts \nquickly and reliably.\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) isn\u2019t just for rapid \nprototyping, research projects, and advanced \nengineering teams. It\u2019s now a viable production \nsolution, and we provide a robust simulation  tool chain to support production designs users \ncreate specifically for AM.\nOur Technology\nALPLA's ambitious sustainability \ngoals are also achieved with the \nhelp of an ongoing investment in technologies that promote lower material consumption and optimized design simulation and its democratization is one element to achieve a reduced material usage in the design and facilitates the increased usage of recycling material. Altair\u2019s solutions can provide designers the access to simulation technology enabling them to contribute to the sustainability of their design and virtually validate better decisions.\u201d \nChristoph Plankel, Head of Product Design, \nALPLA", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALTR_2021.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
