We expanded the program to 12,000 hectares and 120 farmers in 2016.\nEach year, farmers get a report of their \nperformance versus peers and engage their agronomists on opportunities for improving their yield and environmental footprint. In the first two years, farmers in the program reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent versus the regional average, and only one farmer relied on irrigation, thus minimizing the water withdrawal footprint. The program continues for a third year in 2017, expanding to 139 farmers \u2014 of whom 10 percent joined The Nature Conservancy\u2019s Saginaw Bay Regional Conservation Partnership Program that we support.Palm Oil\nWe believe sustainable palm oil is important for the long-term growth of our business and should be accessible to all.\nWithin our supply chain, we tackle deforestation \nthrough our Palm Oil Action Plan. Our suppliers must implement traceability and more sustainable production practices. Our guidelines also dictate that development should not take place in Primary Forest, High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests, or use fire in plantation operations.\nWorking with World Wildlife Fund  and the UNDP , \nwe developed our Palm Oil Action Plan in 2014 \nand updated it in 2016 . The updated plan requires suppliers to improve practices across entire operations and focuses on risk assessment and engagement of third-party suppliers to drive accountability for traded oil. Key new provisions require suppliers to:\n\u2022 Map and assess the risk for all supplying mills \non Global Forest Watch  (GFW)  to increase \ntransparency\n\u2022 Provide assurance that no deforestation occurs on their own concessions and exclude third-party suppliers who do not immediately cease deforestation\n\u2022 Work with recognized third-party experts to protect labor rights\nPhoto Credit: UNDP Indonesia Palm Oil Platform (InPOP)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2016.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
