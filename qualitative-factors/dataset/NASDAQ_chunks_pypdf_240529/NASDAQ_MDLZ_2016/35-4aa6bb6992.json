The team had the unique chance to learn first-hand about the challenges and opportunities in securing a sustainable cocoa supply, as well as help mentor and coach Cocoa Life community members.\nDuring their time, the Joy Ambassadors immersed \nthemselves in Ghanaian culture, visited cocoa communities and learned how cocoa is grown and harvested \u2014 from cutting and scooping to fermenting and drying. In turn, the Joy Ambassadors shared their diverse business skills to help Cocoa Life farmers with the challenges they face managing their business and accelerate the impact of our cocoa sustainability efforts.  \nThe team held community workshops with over \n400 community members centered on enhancing the capacity of cocoa farmers\u2019 cooperatives. Sessions focused on relationship building, as well as negotiation and collaboration skills. You can hear more about the 2016 Joy Ambassadors\u2019 experiences and highlights from their amazing journey in this video .\n\u201c The openness and engagement of the \npeople in Ghana was inspiring. The way they welcomed us with our thoughts and ideas \u2014 having inherent faith that they had something to learn from us was tremendous.
