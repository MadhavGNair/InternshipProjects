We will meaningfully enhance the well-being of people around the world by focusing where we can have the greatest impact. Our three pillars of action to grow our business are:\n\u2022 Expanding 10 existing well-being brands in our portfolio, with the goal of growing them at twice \nthe rate of our base portfolio.  These well-being brands will meet a set of strict, category specific nutrition and ingredient criteria.\n\u2022 Renovating and improving the nutrition and ingredient profile of our biggest-selling brands. We\u2019ve made strong progress in improving the nutrition of our portfolio globally. And by focusing on enhancing the nutrition and ingredients of our biggest selling brands, including removal of artificial ingredients, we can have a greater impact with our most popular snacks that are eaten more frequently.\n\u2022 Continuing to inspire consumers to snack mindfully and plan to deliver 15 percent of our revenue from our portion control snacks.\nOverall, we feel that this portfolio approach to well-being will be better aligned with what consumers are looking for in their snacks and what we are hearing from external partners. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2016.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
