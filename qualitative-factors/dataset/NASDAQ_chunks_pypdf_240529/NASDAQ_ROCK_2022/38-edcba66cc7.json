{"page_content": "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES  \n \nPortfolio management is one of the three pillars of Gibraltar\u2019s strategy to transform the Company \nto create compounding and sustainable val ue for our shareholders and stakeholders . We use  \nportfolio management to optimize t he Company\u2019s business portfolio and ensure our financial capital \nand human resources are effectively and efficient ly deployed to deliver sustainable, profitable \ngrowth, while increasing our relevance with customers and shaping our markets . When we evaluate \nacquisition candidates, we focus on our acquisition rubric which emphasizes attractive markets and \nour ability to extract and create va lue from the target business . Our rubric has guided our capital \nallocation decisions for acquisition targets in the renewables, Agtech, and comfortable living markets . \n \nSince 2015, Gibraltar has invested nearly $500 millio n of capital for acquisitions in the renewables \nand Agtech markets . These investments, coupled with the divestiture of our industrial business \nsegment, have led to a signific ant transformation of our busi ness as noted in the section  \nentitled About Gibraltar . We believe these investments have aligned Gibraltar with more relevant \nproducts and services that address some of the world\u2019s most challenging opportunities, \nincluding climate change . \n \n  \n \n \n \nResilience of Gibraltar\u2019s Strategy for Various Climate Scenarios  \n \nWe recognize the recommendations set forth by th e TCFD of the need to consider how identified \nclimate-related risks and opportunities may evolve and what potential implications to our businesses \nmay be under different warming scenarios . Through our risk assessment process, we have identified \nseveral key climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as mitigation and capitalization measures \nthat our businesses have in place to address them . In our overall risk profile, climate related risks are \nrelatively low, and we believe our portfolio manage ment strategy has posit ioned us well to address \nmitigation and resiliency chall enges posed by  climate change . We may consider conducting a \nclimate-scenario analysis to evaluate our existing programs and processes relative to the TCFD recommendations in the future \n. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPriorities,  Progress  and Performance  39 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ROCK_2022.pdf", "page": 38, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
