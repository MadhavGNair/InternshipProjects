{"page_content": "COMPLIANCE WITH MARKETING \nSTANDARDS\nMarketing is powerful \u2013 it can change \nattitudes and behaviour. It is critical that we \napply high ethical standards to our work to \nensure those changes are for the better. We \nwork hard to maintain high standards and \nstrong compliance in areas such as ethics, \nhuman rights, privacy and data security.\nWe require that all the work our companies \nproduce for clients complies with all relevant \nlegal requirements, codes of practice and \nmarketing standards. There are occasional \ncomplaints made about campaigns we have \nworked on, and some of these are upheld \nby marketing standards authorities. Our \ncompanies take action where needed to \nprevent a recurrence. \nOur agencies have policies and processes \nto mitigate against online advertising \nappearing on sites with illegal, illicit or \nunsuitable content. Our approach to limiting \nrisk and improving trust and quality in the \ndigital supply chain is multi-layered involving \nour trading, operational, technical, legal and \nindustry engagement teams. We take a zero \ntolerance approach to advertising placed \nadjacent to harmful content, in fraudulent \nenvironments or on non-viewable \nplacements but we recognise that zero \ntolerance does not always equal zero risk. \nThat is why we apply a consultative \napproach to brand safety. We believe clients \nshould be fully aware of the strategic, \nimplementation and tactical implications of \nmanaging brand safety across all buying \nmethods and media channels.ETHICAL DECISIONS IN OUR WORK\nWe have a review and referral process \nfor work that may present an ethical risk, \nsuch as work for government clients, work \nrelating to sensitive products or marketing \nto children. \nBefore our people can accept potentially \nsensitive work, they must elevate the \ndecision to the most senior person in the \nrelevant office and then to the most senior \nWPP executive in the country concerned, \nwho will decide if further referral to a global \nWPP executive is required. This referral \nprocess is covered in our How We Behave \nonline training, which will contain a new \nsustainability module from 2020 onwards. \n  See page 49 for more details about updates to \nour How We Behave training \nOur companies also have copy-checking \nand clearance processes for the legal team \nto review campaigns before publication. \nThese processes have strict requirements \nin highly regulated sectors such as \npharmaceutical marketing.\nIn 2019, we established Network Risk \nCommittees with the aims of ensuring \naccountability at both the enterprise and \nnetwork level and to review, monitor and \nadvise on risk and compliance throughout \nall of our businesses and markets. Duties \ninclude providing reports and insights on \ncurrent risk exposures, identifying new \nrisk types and tracking and pro-actively \naddressing any breaches of risk limits.CHANGE THE BRIEF\nIn November, on Mindshare\u2019s 22nd anniversary, \nthe global network with 116 offices and 7,000 \npeople spent the day connecting with the \nscale and urgency of the climate crisis and how \ntheir work could be part of the solution with \n#ChangetheBrief. #ChangetheBrief is an \ninvitation for the advertising industry to use its \nskills to tackle the issue. \n#ChangetheBrief is about creating work which \nanswers the \u201cNow\" brief, but also the \u201cFuture\" \nbrief, to encourage the attitudes, lifestyles and \nbehaviours which are consistent with a transition \nto a carbon-free world. \nFor example, through the \u201cFuture\" brief, a food \nbrand could develop packaging that encourages \npeople to freeze unused food to avoid food \nwaste, while a shampoo client could promote \nconsiderate water usage by creating a \u201csongs to \nsing in the shower\" playlist on Spotify lasting only \nfour minutes.As part of Mindshare day, the network took live \nbriefs from Unilever to generate #ChangetheBrief \nideas. \nCarrie Timms, vice-president of global media at \nUnilever, said: \u201cAt Unilever, we believe brands \nshould be a force for good for the world we live \nin. Mindshare\u2019s #ChangetheBrief initiative is a \npowerful statement to the industry that we \nshould all do what we can through media, both \nexpertise and investment, to deliver a more \nsustainable future.\"\nNick Emery, Global CEO Mindshare, said: \u201cOur \ngreat challenge as a society and as an industry \nis to show how living sustainably is possible, \nenjoyable, fulfilling and aspirational, and that it \ncan also drive our clients\u2019 business. These are all \nthe things that we know how to do.\u201d\n17\nWPP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019SUSTAINABILITY AT THE HEART OF OUR OFFER FOR CLIENTS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WPPGY_2019.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
