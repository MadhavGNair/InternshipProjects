{"page_content": "CREATIVE ACTIVISM\nAGENCY\nSCHOLZ & FRIENDS\nCLIENT\nTHE FEMALE COMPANY\nIn Germany, tampons and other female sanitary \nproducts attract the top value added tax rate of \n19% while many luxury goods \u2013 like truffles and oil \npaintings \u2013 are taxed with the reduced rate of 7%. \nThe so-called tampon tax has already been \nabolished in some countries. \nThe Female Company, an online shop that sells \norganic female sanitary products, decided to take \non the discriminatory tax. To gain attention for the \ntampon tax with media, influencers and politicians, \nScholz & Friends outsmarted the tax law with the \nlaw itself. \nThe agency packaged tampons in books which \nare also taxed with the reduced rate of 7%. But The \nTampon Book  is much more than smart packaging \nthat hacked the German tax system. The Tampon \nBook  contains 45 pages with bold illustrations and \nempowering stories about menstruation, taboos \nand feminism and successfully promoted a petition \nthat urged the German Parliament to discuss the \nabolition of the tampon tax.\nIt was subsequently announced that the reduced \nVAT rate will be charged for female sanitary \nproducts, and this became law in January 2020.\n10,000\ncopies of the  \nbook soldWinner\nCannes Grand Prix and \nfour Lions\nData from: April \u2013 October 2019\nwpp.com/tamponbook\n20\nWPP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019SOCIAL INVESTMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WPPGY_2019.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
