Project Somos works \nto improve the disparity by edu -\ncating children and families about \nthe importance of nutrition, overall \nhygiene as well as dental hygiene in \nthe Tecp\u00e1n area of Guatemala. Over \n90 percent of Tecp\u00e1n\u2019s inhabitants \nare indigenous. The project is run by \nthe Compassion Fruit Society, which Building smiles in Uganda  \n \nThe Build Your Smile Dental  \nFoundation, based in Canada,  \norganizes dental missions to im -\nprove the oral health of communities \nin Uganda. Dentsply Sirona Canada \nis proud of its ongoing support of \nthe foundation, helping it to utilize \nthe latest dental and laboratory \ntechnology in challenging settings. \nA recent mission resulted in 1,022 \ntooth extractions, 2,300 fluoride  \ntreatments, and the delivery of 90 \ndentures. The team placed over \n100 restorations and performed 130 \npreventive scaling treatments. They \nwere even able to perform five bone \ngraft surgeries and seven patients \nreceived dental implants.  \n \nBeyond the physical dental work, \nthe foundation also trains local \ndental practitioners to work at their \nstandard of care. Build Your Smile\u2019s \nvaluable volunteer work continues \nto substantially improve lives of \nthose they treat in Uganda, who \nwould otherwise face adversity due \nto not having teeth.  \n \nTransforming treatment in Kenya  \n \nDentaid supports dentists around \nthe world by providing equipment, \nrunning oral health programs and \nsending teams of volunteer dental \nprofessionals. In rural Kenya the \nneed for these projects is high, as \nthe dentist to population ratio is \n1:40,000, while the World Health \nOrganization recommends a ratio  \nof 1:7,500.  \n \nDentsply Sirona supported  \nDentaid in 2019 with the donation  \nof a portable Cavitron Select \nultrasonic scaler, which made a \nsignificant difference by completely \ntransforming the amount of work \nthe team was able to do. In 2019,  \nthe mission completed 322 scaling \ntreatments.is a Canadian charity. In indigenous \ncommunities near where Project So -\nmos works, preventive dental care is \nnot something most can afford.  \n \nTherefore, in 2019, Dentsply Sirona  \nsponsored two days of dental \ntreatment, held at the Maxillofacial \nCentre in Antigua, Guatemala, for \n40 children aged 3 to 8. For most \nof the children, this was their first \nvisit to a dentist. All of the patients \nreceived a panoramic X-ray or OPT, \nand a clinical examination to deter -\nmine the rate of decayed, missing or \nfilled teeth. Some children received \nroot canal treatment while most  \nof them were treated for cavities  \nwith fillings and some received  \nfluoride applications.A patient \nreceives new \ndentures at  \nthe Build Your \nSmile outreach \nin Uganda,  \nimproving his \nquality of life \nimmensely.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XRAY_2019.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
