Due to \nthis diversification, the ideal solution \nis available to everyone, from new 3D \nusers to experienced practitioners \nready to maximize on all of the pos -\nsibilities with 3D technology.\nPre-clinical testing  \n \nDentsply Sirona develops and  \nlicenses numerous medical devices \nfor use in dental care applications. \nThe Company strives to develop \ninnovations that represent significant \nimprovements to the status quo. \nWhenever possible, Dentsply Sirona \nuses in-vitro or benchtop methods \nthat do not require testing on  \nanimals. When studies involving \nanimals are absolutely necessary \n(e.g., when required by law, regula -\ntion or standards) to establish safety, \nDentsply Sirona uses facilities that \nfollow the relevant national guide -\nlines for the Care and Use of Animals. \nIn the U.S., this follows 21CFR Part 58 \nand 9CFR Parts 1-3 and global ISO \n10993-2 (Animal Welfare Require -\nments). These guidelines require that \nall studies be approved by an Institu -\ntional Animal Care and Use Commit -\ntee and the number of animals are \nlimited to the minimum amount pos -\nsible to demonstrate safety and effi -\ncacy prior to human clinical studies. \nThe 3R principle of replace, reduce \nand refine is always applied. Dentsp -\nly Sirona partners with institutions \nwith highest ethical standards and \nthey calculate the minimum number \nof animals required. Within these \nfacilities, animal research monitoring is required to ensure that the animals \nare treated safely and humanely.  \nClinical testing  \n \nPrior to commercializing innovative \nproducts, Dentsply Sirona often uti -\nlizes data from human clinical tests. \nThe company conducts all studies \nwith human subjects in a manner \nthat protects the safety and rights \nof patients and investigators. In \naddition to protecting the rights of \nindividuals, including confidentiality, \nDentsply Sirona complies with regu -\nlatory requirements of the countries \nin which studies are conducted and \nthose in which regulatory submis -\nsions take place. Its practice ensures \nthat controls are in place and fol -\nlowed to protect the integrity of the \nstudy results.  \n \nDental amalgam  \n \nDental amalgam, which is com -\nposed of a mixture of metals such \nas silver, mercury, copper, and tin, is \nconsidered a safe, affordable, and \ndurable material that has been used \nfor over 100 years to restore teeth \naffected by dental caries (tooth \ndecay). It has a long-established \nrecord of safety and effectiveness. \nWhile it has been the subject of \nquestions because of its mercury \ncontent, dental amalgam has been \nstudied and reviewed extensively \nand continues to be preferred and \nused by dental professionals in  \ncertain clinical applications.  \nDentsply Sirona sells numerous \nrestorative products that are alter -\nnatives to amalgam. Many organiza -\ntions, including the American Dental \nAssociation (ADA), Federation Den -\ntaire Internationale (World Dental \nFederation) and the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA), support the \nuse of dental amalgam. The Com -pany has \nreviewed \nand evaluated its \ndental amalgam prod -\nuct line.This review included assess -\nment of a wide range of factors \nincluding the clinical effectiveness \nof amalgam, published scientific \nstudies regarding material safety, \nthe results of the FDA review of \ndental amalgam, as well as envi -\nronmental and legal considerations. \nBased on an internal assessment \nand published industry research, \nDentsply Sirona concludes that \ndental amalgam continues to be a \nuseful restorative material whose \nsafety and efficacy have been ex -\ntensively documented.\nBased on this assessment and the \nneeds of customers, Dentsply Sirona \nexpects to continue to responsi -\nbly manufacture and sell dental \namalgam while focusing research \nand development investments on \nadvanced alternative dental-restor -\native materials. In agreement with \nthe Minamata Convention, Dentsply \nSirona supports the consensus for \na phase-down approach, ratified by \nthe Convention and signed by over \n100 countries, to reduce the use of \ndental amalgams. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s \nmarketing efforts and educational \nactivities are designed to educate \nclinicians about the benefits and \ntechniques for using today\u2019s state-\nof-the-art alternative restorative  \nsolutions. In addition, the Company \ncontinues to promote the use of the \nADA\u2019s Best Management Practices \nfor Amalgam Waste to customers \nwho choose to use dental amalgam. \nFinally, Dentsply Sirona supports \na variety of industry-wide initia -\ntives to promote prevention of \noral health disease, which in turn, \nreduces the need for restorative \nprocedures.32\n \nThe SmartLite Pro \ncuring light sets \nnew standards for \ndentists.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XRAY_2019.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
