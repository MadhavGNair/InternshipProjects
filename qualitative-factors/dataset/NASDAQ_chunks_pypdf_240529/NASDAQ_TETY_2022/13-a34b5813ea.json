As the data is \ncollected, Tethys Oil will assess the discov-\nery\u2019s long-term technical and commercial \nviability.\nIn addition to the three wells on the Al \nJumd discovery, two exploration wells were \ndrilled on Block 56 in other parts of the Al \nJumd area in 2022.\nBlock 58 \nBlock 58 covers an area of 4,557 km2 and \nis adjacent to Tethys Oil\u2019s operated explo-\nration licence in Block 49 located in the \nDhofar Governorate in the southern part \nof Oman. The South Oman Salt Basin \nand the Western Deformation Front area \nis characterised as gravel and rocky plain \ndesert landscape, rural setting, with minor, \nsmall industrial activity and agricultural \nactivities scattered across the area. Situ-\nated on the Nejd plateau the Project area \nis characterised by gravel plains, low hills, \nand wadis. A relatively diverse plant and \nanimal community is associated mainly \nwith the wadi areas, while the gravel plains \nare less varied. \nIn 2020, Tethys Oil was awarded the \nlicence as the operator with a 100 percent \ninterest share in the Block. \nIn 2022, processing of 450 km2 3D seis-\nmic acquired over the South Lahan area \nis near completion and the interpretation \nwork is well underway. The interpretation \nis expected to yield drillable prospects in \nthe first half of of 2023.\nIn the Fahd area, in the Block\u2019s north-\neastern corner, prospect maturation was \ncompleted in the fourth quarter 2022 and \nvolumetrics have been finalised. Based on \nfurther analysis of the finalised prospect \ninventory, the location for the first explo-\nration well on the Block will be selected, \nwith drilling planned for the second half \nof 2023.\nNon-operated interests\nProduction Blocks 3&4 \nThe vegetation of the central desert is \nsparse with low species richness. Indeed, \ndespite covering nearly three quarters of \nOman\u2019s land mass it is estimated that only \nabout 200 floral species, approximately 20 \npercent of the total species in Oman, occur \nwithin the central desert. The operations' \narea does not lie within either a candidate \nor designated conservation area. \nIn areas of ongoing production activities, \nmore detailed and broader-spectrum anal-\nyses are customarily required. Tethys Oil \nholds a 30 percent non-operated interest in \nBlocks 3&4 and has maintained an inter-\nest in the blocks since 2007. The blocks\u2019 \nproduction is produced from several fields; \nFarha South, Saiwan East, Shahd, Ulfa, \nSamha, Erfan and Anan.\nComplete production facilities have been \nconstructed on Farha South field and on Saiwan East field. At these facilities, reser-\nvoir fluids are processed in separators and \nheater treaters to remove water, gas and \nimpurities to make the oil ready for export. \nThe facilities also include large storage \ntanks, pumps and other necessary infra-\nstructure including field camps for the oil \nfield staff. In 2022, the operational focus \non Blocks 3&4 has been on mitigating the \ndeclining production over the course of the \nyear that followed the decreased activities \nduring the pandemic years.\nBlocks 3&4 have an active Health, Safety \nand Environment (HSE) programme man-\naged by the operator focused on health and \nsafety issues, emission reduction and spill \nprevention plans. One of the primary envi-\nronmental challenges for Blocks 3&4 is the \nreduction of emissions resulting from the \nflaring of associated gas and the consump-\ntion of diesel for power generation. The \ncommercial evaluation is to be completed \nin the first quarter of 2023 and the first \nphase of power production is expected to \nstart by the end of the year. \nTethys Oil\u2019s activities strive to create shared \nprosperity between stakeholders. It seeks to \nrespect and gain the respect of the people \nand governments of the countries in which \nit operates. In 2022 Tethys Oil and the \npartners for Blocks 3&4 sponsored several \ncommunity activities.\nFor more information about Tethys Oil's \noperations on its operated and non-oper-\nated blocks, please see the Annual Report \n2022.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TETY_2022.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
