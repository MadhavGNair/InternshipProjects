We believe that Zealand has an obligation to be socially \nresponsible in order to benefit not only Zealand\u2019s main stakeholders, being mainly shareholders, patients \nand employees, but also to society. It remains a key foc us for us across our business to have an open, \nengaging and respectful communication with all our stakeholders.  \n   \nOur CSR efforts are based on the most admissible elements of some of the most widely implemented \nCSR initiatives in the world, notably the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the United Nations Global \nCompact. Zealand has found in these two systems complementary frameworks for both guiding and \nreporting its CSR activities along several principles in the areas of labor, the environment, huma n rights \nand anti -corruption. In addition to these, we have supplemented a provisional category for animal rights \nowing to the unique exigencies of our industry.  \n \nZealand is a maturing biotech company with established scientific expertise and a leading -edge position \nin turning peptides into medicines.

Zealand\u2019s strategic focus \nis on its growing proprietary pipeline, which includes four inves tigational medicines in clinical \ndevelopment.  \n \nIn 2015 we launched an accelerated growth strategy which we call \u201dFrom peptide to patient\u201d. It is an \nambitious strategy for accelerated value creation that builds both on the prospects of significant revenue \ngrowth from our out -licensed products and on the potential in our growing proprietary pipeline.  \n \nThe strategy consists of four main elements:  \n\u2022 Build a portfolio of proprietary medicines  \n\u2022 Focus on specialty disease areas  \n\u2022 Enhance our peptide expertise and main tain a dynamic R&D organization  \n\u2022 Accelerate growth via strategic partnerships  \n \nThe strategy is rooted in our core values: Ambitious, Passionate, Courageous, Curious and Empathetic. \nThese are fundamental for the way we work and act against all stakeholders.
