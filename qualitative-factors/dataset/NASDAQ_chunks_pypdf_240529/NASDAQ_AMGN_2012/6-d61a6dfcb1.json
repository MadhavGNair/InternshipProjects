We identified a multitude of ways to recycle, \nincluding composting landscape, food, and disposable food-service \nwaste, and reusing equipment and office supplies on-site. With this \nsuccess as a foundation, we shifted to the practice of reducing the \nwaste at its source.\nAmgen continuously strives to conserve water, which is a vital \ncomponent of our medicines. Water conservation solutions we\u2019ve \nimplemented include a wastewater treatment plant in Puerto Rico \nthat has enabled an average of 70 percent of the treated wastewater \ngenerated at the facility to be recycled on-site each year, and low-water \nlandscaping and smart-irrigation controls at a variety of facilities.Water Intake Water Intake Avoided* through Conservation Efforts3,000\n1,000\n5002,000\n1,5002,5003,500\n*Value represents year-over-year, cumulative avoidance.2007\u20132011 Water Intake and Intake Avoided* \nthrough Conservation Efforts (1,000 m3)Water\n0Reduction\nRecycling, Composting, Reuse\nDisposal\n2007 2008 2010 2011 2009 2012\n2007 2008 2010 2011 2009 20123,286\n2,738 2,537 2,574 2,5772,720550601663 673690", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2012.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
