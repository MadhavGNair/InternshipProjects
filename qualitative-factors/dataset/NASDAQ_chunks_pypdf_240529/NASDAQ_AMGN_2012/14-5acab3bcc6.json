{"page_content": "15Notes\n(a) The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and \u201cAdjusted\u201d results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each \nadjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the US marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including amortization of \nintangible assets and non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including the charge for \ncertain legal proceedings and stock option expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the tax jurisdictions where the expenses are incurred or the \nasset is located and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions.Summary of Data \u2014 Notes\nBusiness Profile\n(p)Corporate political contributions represent Amgen Inc.\u2019s US aggregate contributions among those states where these are permissible.
