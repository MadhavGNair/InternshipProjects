Additional information may be found in the \nCorporate Governance section at www.amgen.com.Summary of Data \u2014 Notes\n(a)Amgen has included data from 15 facilities covering energy and carbon, water, and waste. The facilities represent approximately 95 percent of Amgen\u2019s worldwide facility space based on \ntotal square feet. Included facilities are in Thousand Oaks, California, US; Greenwich, Rhode Island, US; Boulder and Longmont, Colorado, US; Seattle and Bothell, Washington, US; Juncos, \nPuerto Rico, US; Louisville, Kentucky, US; South San Francisco, California, US; Cambridge and Woburn, Massachusetts, US; Burnaby, Canada; Breda, Netherlands; Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; \nand Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge, United Kingdom. This includes leased buildings where we have operational control over building infrastructure, including utilities. In 2011, Amgen \ndivested of its Fremont, California, facility and acquired facilities in Dun Laoghaire, Woburn, and S\u00e3o Paulo. In 2012, Amgen acquired four companies: Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, \ndeCODE genetics, and Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals. In our 2012 report, data beginning in May 2011 through the end of 2012 will be included from our Dun Laoghaire facility, which \nwe purchased in May 2011. Data will be included from our Woburn and Abingdon facilities beginning in March 2011 through the end of 2012. No data will be included for our S\u00e3o Paulo \nfacility or for Micromet, KAI Pharmaceuticals, deCODE genetics, or Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals in this report, as we are still working through the integration process for these facilities.\n(b)Measurement and verification of conservation and reduction projects for energy and carbon dioxide, water, and waste are based on adaptation of the International Performance \nMeasurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Concepts and Options for Determining Energy and Water Savings Volume 1, EVO 10000-1.2007, April 2007. Project measurements \nare conducted using reasonable means, including direct measurements and scientific estimations as appropriate.\n(c) Small changes to 2007\u201311 data have occurred due to refinements in calculations. All changes have been confirmed through a documented change control process.\n(d)Direct energy use results from the operation of equipment that is owned or controlled by Amgen at the facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of natural gas, propane, and diesel in \nboilers, furnaces, and HVAC are recorded from utility bills or purchase records. Data on the use of diesel in emergency generators are recorded from purchase records or meter readings \nand, in some cases, estimated from run-hours. Utility bills recorded in units of volume are converted to energy by using the Global Reporting Initiative Version 3.0, EN3 table, to convert \nvolumes of primary sources (natural gas, diesel), or from specific fuel analysis data (diesel used in Juncos, Puerto Rico), and the US Energy Information Administration/Annual Energy \nReview Table A1 (propane). Energy from emergency generators recorded as run-hours is estimated using the manufacturer\u2019s specified fuel-feed rate for each generator.\n(e)Indirect energy use results from purchased energy in the forms of electricity and steam at the Amgen facilities listed in note (a). Data on the use of electricity and steam are recorded \nfrom utility bills. Utility bills for purchased steam that are recorded in units of mass (i.e., \u2018lb steam\u2019) are converted to energy by using the latent heat of evaporation from the saturated \nsteam tables, then dividing by the efficiency of the supplier\u2019s steam generator.\n(f)Scope 1 carbon emissions result from direct energy sources defined in note (c). Carbon emissions from our US sales fleet and executive air fleet are found in the Other Carbon category \nin this data summary. Carbon data from natural gas sources are calculated using regional specific emission factors from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for all US \nsites; from the Ireland UFCCC for Amgen\u2019s facility in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland; from U.K. Defra/DECC\u2019s 110819 Guidelines for Amgen\u2019s facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, \nand Cambridge); from the NL Agency standard CO2 emission factors for Amgen\u2019s facility in the Netherlands (Breda); and from the Methodology for Reporting 2011 Version 2.0/Ministry of \nEnvironment Victoria, BC, December 2011, for Amgen\u2019s facility in Burnaby, Canada. Carbon emissions data from propane and diesel fuel sources (except Amgen\u2019s facility in Juncos, Puerto \nRico) are calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (Sept 2011). Carbon from diesel use in Amgen\u2019s Juncos, Puerto Rico, facility are \ncalculated using specific fuel analysis information and from US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-1. Carbon data from direct energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors \nfrom the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Stationary Combustion-V.1.0 (Jul 2009). Scope 1 emissions that are not included in this data summary include fugitive emissions \nfrom chillers, coolers, and HVAC, as well as process-related emissions from cell respiration (carbon as a by-product) and pH adjustments (CO2 injection). Analysis of these sources in \n2012 showed that our fugitive emissions are less than 3 percent of total carbon emissions when compared with other sources such as energy use and that cell respiration and emissions \nfrom pH adjustments are negligible (less than 0.1 percent of our total carbon emissions). Processes are in place to maintain chillers, coolers, and HVAC equipment to prevent unintended \nemissions. Amgen has not included fugitive emission sources as a core emission but will continue to monitor these impacts.\n(g)Scope 2 carbon emissions result from indirect energy sources defined in note (d). Carbon data from purchased electricity are calculated using emission factors from US EPA eGRID2010 \n10/11/2011 Version 3.2 (2007 data: eGRID subregion annual carbon output emission rate) for all US locations except Amgen\u2019s facility in Puerto Rico which has been determined using \nEPA GHG Report YE 2011 for Power Suppliers in Puerto Rico; from the Greenhouse Gas Division, Environment Canada (2006 data)-V.1.0 (April 2009) for Amgen\u2019s facility in Burnaby, \nCanada; and from specific utility annual providers\u2019 reports for Amgen facilities in the United Kingdom (Uxbridge, Abingdon, and Cambridge), the Netherlands (Breda), and Dun Laoghaire, \nIreland. Carbon data from purchased steam are calculated using the Emission Factor for Natural Gas as identified in US EPA Rule Part 98A Table C-3 (US weighted average) for Amgen\u2019s \nfacility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Carbon data from indirect energy sources prior to 2011 were calculated using emission factors from US EPA eGRID2007 Version 1.1 for US facilities.\n(h)The Other Carbon category contains Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon emissions that are tracked but not included in our current CO2 reduction target. Carbon emissions from our \nexecutive air fleet are calculated using emission factors from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Cross-Sector Tools-Transport-Fuel-Use (Sept 2011). Carbon emissions from our US sales \nfleet are calculated using emission factors from the GHG Protocol Emission Factors for Petrol passenger cars (volume) (GHG Protocol) = 8.81 kg/gal. Fuel use and mileage data are \ncollected at the pump for each vehicle. Carbon emissions from our commercial business travel are calculated by Amgen\u2019s travel provider using the Defra tool. Carbon emissions from \nAmgen\u2019s material transportation have been provided by the carrier using its own specific methods.\n(i)Scope 3 carbon emissions are a consequence of the activities of the Company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the Company. Scope 3 carbon emissions that are \ncurrently tracked include emissions from Amgen\u2019s commercial business travel (air and rail) and material transportation.\n(j) Commercial business travel was not tracked in 2007 or 2008. Material transportation was not tracked from 2007 to 2011.\n(k) Slight discrepancy between values for total water fate and total water withdrawal is due to rounding and compilation of individual facility totals.\n(l) Recycling rate is the proportion of waste that is recycled and reused compared with the total volume of routine, nonhazardous waste generated with potential for landfill disposal.\n(m)Treatment means the physical, thermal, chemical, or biological processes that change the characteristics of the waste in order to reduce its volume or hazardous nature, facilitate its \nhandling, or enhance recovery.\n(n) Nonroutine waste constitutes waste generated outside the normal operations of our facilities and consists mainly of construction and demolition waste.General\nEnergy\nCarbon\nOther Carbon\nWater\nWaste\n(o) Measurement equivalents: 23.0 MPG-US = 27.6 MPG-Imperial = 10.2 L/100KM = 9.78 KM/LFleet", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2012.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
