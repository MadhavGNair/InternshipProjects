We started our sustainability \napproach by tackling large projects that provided big returns for both \nenergy savings and carbon reduction across our network of facilities \naround the world. Most recently, we\u2019ve looked at new technologies \nfor product manufacturing that provide energy and carbon reduction \nbenefits. Energy conservation and carbon reduction projects have \nsaved our Company close to $17 million annually and reduced carbon \nemissions by 83,000 metric tons since 2008.\nOur improvement target for the fuel efficiency of our US sales fleet, \nwhich we met in 2012, has driven our approach to fleet management \nover the years. We\u2019ve steadily expanded fuel-efficient vehicle choices \navailable for mobile staff, rotating less-fuel-efficient vehicles out of the \nfleet for more-efficient options that achieve 23 miles per gallon or higher.\n2007\u2013201 2 US Fleet Fuel Use and Fuel Use Avoided\u2020 through \nConservation  (per 1,000 Gal)\n2,000\n1,000\n500\n01,5002,500\nUS Fleet Fuel Use Fuel Use Avoided through Conservation Efforts1,498 1,297169\n1,44314\n1,849345\n1,784 1,739363427Fuel Efficiency4,019245\n4,006\n410\n200936Performance\n83\n383\n20122007 2008 2010 2011 2009 2012\n2007 2008 2010 2011 2009 2012", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2012.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
