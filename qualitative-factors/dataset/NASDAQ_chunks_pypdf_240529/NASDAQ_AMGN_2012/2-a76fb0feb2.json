We saved more than $24 million in costs from \n2008 to 2012 as a result of striving toward those targets and achieving efficiency gains. For 2020, we have set new \ntargets in the areas of facility carbon emissions, fleet carbon emissions, and disposed waste reduction, emphasizing \na continued focus on reducing greenhouse gases as well as the amount of waste we dispose.Our Targets\nFinal Results 2012 Target\nWater  Reduce 235,000 cubic meters (m3)\n7% of 2007 baseline\nRecycling   Divert more than 40% \n2007 rate was 38%\nWaste   Reduce 700 metric tons (MT)\n7% of 2007 baseline\nFuel efficiency   Improve by 4 miles per gallon (MPG)\n23% of 2007 baselineEnergy  Reduce 500,000 gigajoules (GJ) \n12% of 2007 baseline\nCarbon dioxide   Reduce 75,000 metric tons (MT) \n18% of 2007 baseline83,000 MT\n690,000 m3\n59 percent\n1,094 MT\n5 MPG919,000 GJThis brochure, a supplement to Amgen\u2019s 2012 Environmental Sustainability Report found at \nenvironment.amgen.com, highlights how the Company has successfully implemented an environmental \nsustainability plan in a data-driven and strategic way.
