Risk awareness and risk culture are two \nprimary components of our enterprise risk management. \nRisk Awareness\nOur risk management team is comprised of risk managers who work with various areas of the organization to \nmonitor risks and establish risk profiles. This team\u2019s work transcends siloed or departmental risks to instead \ndevelop an enterprise-wide view of risks. Risk and control self-assessments are deployed as a bottom up \napproach to the development of a process mapping exercise to best understand our risks. This assessment \nhighlights process improvement opportunities, potential risks and openings for gained efficiencies. \nRisk Culture\nStrong leadership and ongoing training are required at Ameris. Both allow us to better understand how to make \neducated risk-related decisions and ensure consistent risk behavior. Ameris consistently educates our first line \nof defense \u2013 the front-line business units \u2013 as they play an important role in identifying, measuring, managing, \nmonitoring and reporting risks. Additionally, development of a common risk language, as well as a shared \nmethodology for identifying, assessing and measuring risk, is ongoing and critical in supporting our unified and \ntransparent approach to risk management. \nGovernance: Acting with Integrity", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ABCB_2020.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
