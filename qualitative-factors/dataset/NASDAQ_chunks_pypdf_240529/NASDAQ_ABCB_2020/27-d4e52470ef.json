Ameris was \ndetermined not to allow this increase in volume to negatively impact customer experience or quality of service. \nAs a result, in 2020, the ingenuity of our mortgage and technology teams created scalable, automated, \nelectronic and robotic solutions. This inventiveness enhanced customer experiences and added quality and \nassistance without increasing expense. \n\u2022 Automated Processing of Interim Checks. What once was a tedious process, technology now automatically \nscans the check, obtains the necessary data and enters the data into our software of record. This new \nautomated process significantly decreases customer servicing issues, expedites turnaround and allows our \nteammates to focus on more complex customer needs. \n\u2022 Automated Insurance Transfer Letters.  Teammates \nwere previously processing and mailing the extensive  \namount of letters needed when a loan closes and \ntransfers to our third-party servicing provider. To \nincrease efficiency, software was created that now \nprogrammatically streamlines this correspondence. \nThis automatic trigger-based process pulls all \nnecessary information from the closed loan, feeds \nthe data into our loan software, creates the necessary \nletters and sends them to a third-party print and mail \nfulfillment site. \nCorporate Social Responsibility Report | 28 Advancing a Sustainable Future1Ameris Bank estimates there to be 8,211,017 pages associated with the \n148,007 e-statements.
