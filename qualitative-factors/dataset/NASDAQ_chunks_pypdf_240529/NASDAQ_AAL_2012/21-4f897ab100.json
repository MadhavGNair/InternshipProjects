{"page_content": "22The GHG Intensity Ratio chart shows our progress, splitting out performance attributable to American Airlines, American Eagle and AMR as a whole. We continue to implement \nmeasures to meet our 20-year goal, and with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft coming online, we are confident that progress towards our goal should accelerate.\nThis chart shows American\u2019s progress towards its goal of reducing overall GHG intensity by 30 percent by 2025. Our intensity ratio compares the amount of CO2e we emitted with \nthe work we performed as measured by revenue ton miles (RTMs), which is the weight of passengers and cargo we are paid to transport.\nFuel Smart conservation initiative\nFuel Smart is our cornerstone fuel conservation initiative. Established in 2005, this program identifies and implements new fuel-saving ideas. To date, we\u2019ve saved more than 800 \nmillion gallons of fuel and reduced emissions by 7.8 million tons of carbon dioxide.\nFuel Smart 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 GOAL\nAnnual Savings Rate Improvement (million gallons) 108 123 141 147 154\nEvery year, we set a new goal for improvement in the Fuel Smart Annual Savings Rate. Our success in reaching these goals directly translates to cost savings for the company, especially as fuel prices continue to \nrise.\nAMR fuel consumption and pricing 2012 2011\nFuel consumption (gallons, in millions) 2,723 2,756\nFuel price per gallon (USD) $3.20 $3.01\nAs part of our ongoing partnership with Air Compassion for Veterans (ACV), a portion of Fuel Smart savings generated by employees is used by ACV to provide transportation for wounded warriors and their families.
