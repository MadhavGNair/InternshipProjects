Our \nbaseline year is 2019 and the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard \nwas used in the calculation of energy use and GHG emissions. Electricity emission factors are \nobtained from the International Energy Agency\u2019s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 2020 \nreport, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Emissions & Generation Resource \nIntegrated Database (eGRID) publication. Additional emissions factors are sourced from the UK \nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). All energy sources are included in \nintensity calculations. Gases covered in GHG emissions calculations include CO2, CH4, N2O, \nand HFCs. Global warming potentials are obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. The chosen consolidation approach for emissions \nis facilities under operational control. We have no emissions from biogenic sources. Emissions \ncalculations are based on a combination of actual, estimated and extrapolated data. As our \nemissions methodology is refined in future years, our emissions numbers are subject to change.SOCIAL\nGOVERNANCEINTRODUCTION\nENVIRONMENTAL\nAbout the Report\nData Tables \nGRI Content Index\nSASB Index\nTCFD IndexAPPENDIX\nESG REPORT 2021 \u2013  56", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZD_2021.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
