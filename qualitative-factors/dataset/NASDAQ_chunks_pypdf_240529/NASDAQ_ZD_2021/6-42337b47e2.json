As part of this work, Ziff Davis retained the \nGovernance & Accountability Institute (G&A), a highly respected advisor on \nESG issues, to perform an independent third-party assessment.\nThe assessment began by examining a range of key stakeholders, as well \nas studying industry peers, to conduct a materiality analysis for ESG topics. \nTopics included each of the GRI Standards Topics, the SASB Software & IT \nServices 2018 Accounting Standard and SASB Internet Media & Services \n2018 Accounting Standard, and other ESG topics of interest to investors \nand other important stakeholders.\nWe first mapped sector-specific material ESG topics identified by these \nstakeholders to the GRI Standards Topics. For material ESG topics \nidentified that did not map directly to a GRI Standards Topic, an additional \n\u201cNon-GRI Material Topic\u201d was added to the materiality analysis. This initial \nstep produced a list of 38 topics of interest to different stakeholder groups.Our Key Stakeholder Groups: Materiality-based Approach to ESG \nOur materiality assessment identified 38 \ntopics of interest to stakeholders.A Message from Our CEO\nCommitments  \nMateriality-based  \nApproach to ESG\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCEINTRODUCTION\nENVIRONMENTAL\nAPPENDIX\nESG REPORT 2021 \u2013  7", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZD_2021.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
