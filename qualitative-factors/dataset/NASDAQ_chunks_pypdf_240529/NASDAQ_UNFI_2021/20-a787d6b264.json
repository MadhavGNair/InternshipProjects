We are currently preparing to install a roof-mounted solar project at one of our distribution centers, which will be our largest to date with the potential to add over 3,785 MWh of solar production to support that distribution center.\n40 39 Better for All Report  |  FY 2021\nAs we continue our energy efficiency work, we are also honing in on our renewable energy strategy. We want to increase the overall portion of renewable electricity we consume and are evaluating new renewable energy projects, including power purchase agreements, utility \nRetrofitting our existing operations is an important step, but when we have to  construct new distribution centers to accommodate our growth, we\u2019re building them better. We implement LEED\u00ae green building program practices to help save energy and water, reduce climate warming emissions, and provide a healthier indoor working environment for our associates.
