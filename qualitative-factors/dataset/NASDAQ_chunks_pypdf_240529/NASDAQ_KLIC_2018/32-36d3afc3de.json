Conducted Gemba Walk to assess current \nstate of waste management process  \n2. Mapped out waste disposal process \nstating various waste categories, person -\nin-charge, sources  of waste  \n3. Identified gaps and brainstormed on \naction plans for improvement  \n4. Implemented monthly reporting on solid \nwaste and recycled  waste disposal  \n \n \nSince the implementation, waste has undergo ne proper classification and percentage of recyclable \nhas improved significantly from the previous year . In addition, a RASCI* syst em has been \nimplemented which guides on the allocation of waste management  resources . The FY2018 recycling \nrate was 62.7% (of total solid waste recorded 436  kg), an improvement of 6.9% from CY2017.  \n \n*RASCI describes the level of responsibility in a decreasing manner. It stands for who is responsible, who is \naccountable, who is supporting, who is consulted and who should be informed.  \n \nCase S tudy 2 : Value Stream Mapping for Waste Management at K&S Sin gapore   \nTable 7: Gaps Identified and Actions Taken by K&S Singapore  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2018.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
