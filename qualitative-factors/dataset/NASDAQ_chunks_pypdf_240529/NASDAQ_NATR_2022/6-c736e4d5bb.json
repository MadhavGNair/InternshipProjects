MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT\nIn early 2023, we conducted a materiality assessment to \nhelp us better understand the topics that matter most \nto our stakeholders. We use these topics to prioritize \nour Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and \nsustainability efforts for the coming years.    \nWe sought out and heard from voices within Nature\u2019s \nSunshine for a diversity of perspectives when \ndetermining our material ESG topics. We distributed a \nmateriality survey asking our employees in every region \nto rank 26 ESG topics by importance to the individual, \nNature\u2019s Sunshine as a business, and our stakeholders.   We compared the quantitative survey data to interviews \nwith members of the executive leadership team, subject \nmatter experts and key external stakeholders.    \nOur ESG leadership team further assessed the final \ntopics to prioritize those with the highest potential \nimpact on society and our business as well as the \nhighest importance among our key internal and external \nstakeholders. \nHIGHEST \nIMPACT\nSUBSTANTIAL \nIMPACT\nMODERATE \nIMPACT\nIMPORTANCE TO NSPIMPORTANCE TO STAKEHOLDERS\nEnvironmental (E) Social (S) Governance (G)Supplier DiversityRegenerative AgWater ManagementEmployee Well-Being  \n& EngagementLearning & DevelopmentEnergy Management BiodiversitySustainable PackagingTalent Recruitment  \n& RetentionStakeholder EngagementClimate ActionResponsible Sourcing\nHuman RightsSupply Chain \nResiliencyESG Governance & Integration\nWaste Management\nDEICommunity Investment & ImpactIngredients Transparency2022 ESG REPORT 2022 ESG REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_NATR_2022.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
