Through \ncollaboration with ArcBest Technologies, ArcBest has \ncollected and analyzed this data over the last several \nmonths, allowing us to accurately disclose emissions \noutput. This project is ongoing as we work to create an \nESG dashboard that offers greater insights into how we \ncan better manage these levels of emissions. We also \nplan to capture and measure Scope 3 emissions over \ntime. \nWhile we know there is significant work to be \ndone in environmental disclosure, we have made \nconsiderable progress since our initial ESG reporting. \nWe\u2019re committed to continual progress and increased \nreporting as we move forward.\nGross Global \nScope 1 Emissions\nMetric tons (t) CO2-e\nView Full SASB Index >486,670\nMetric tons (t) CO2-e15,348Gross Global \nScope 2 Emissions", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2021.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
