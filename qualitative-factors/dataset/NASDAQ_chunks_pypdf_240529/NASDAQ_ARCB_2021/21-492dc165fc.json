{"page_content": "21  |  GovernancePreparing for Crisis and \nBusiness Disruptions \nAs a leading logistics provider with global reach, we understand that \nfailure to prepare for and respond to a crisis or business disruption \nin a timely and effective manner can have a direct impact on our \nability to serve our stakeholders. No one can predict when disaster \nor disruption will strike, but having a plan in place if it does can help \nmitigate the impact.\nTo heighten the resilience of our business in the face of disruption, \nin 2021, we developed the ArcBest Crisis Management Framework, \nwhich provides a planning structure that improves our ability to \nprepare for, respond to and recover from crisis events. Our focus \nwas and is on developing an all-encompassing view of crisis \nmanagement and business continuity plans and bringing those \nplans and our people together to coordinate efforts. \nOur Crisis Management Planning Team includes employees from \nmany departments across the organization who work together to \ndefine how the company prepares, responds to and recovers from \na wide variety of disruptive events. Moving forward, this team will \nfocus on building awareness, training and testing these plans to \nensure the program\u2019s success.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
