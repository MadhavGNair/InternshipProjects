{"page_content": "39  |  Technology and InnovationGirls Who Code \nIn September 2021, volunteers from ArcBest Technologies launched a Girls Who Code (GWC) club \nat Southside High School (SHS) in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for the 2021-2022 school year. GWC is on \na mission to close the gender gap in technology, instilling core values of bravery, sisterhood and \nactivism. \nThe club at SHS consisted of 25 students and 12 ArcBest Technologies volunteers who met every \ntwo weeks after school to collaborate on mini IT-inspired projects, using tutorials provided by the \nGirls Who Code program. Projects included using Scratch language to code and create interactive \ngames and animations, using Python language to create storytelling programs and interactive \nchatbots and using JavaScript to learn game development concepts. The projects allowed the students to work together to develop a foundation they can \nbuild on as they gain experience with tech and computer science fields. \nI think most women have experienced loneliness at some point during their IT journey, \nwhether that be as the only female in their college classes or on a team at work. To \nbe able to provide a space for these girls to connect and form a network is not only \npersonally fulfilling, but it can mean the difference between them choosing a career in IT \nor changing course to another profession.\n       Adrienne Kaminshine\n       technical administrator and \n       SHS Girls Who Code program director\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2021.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
