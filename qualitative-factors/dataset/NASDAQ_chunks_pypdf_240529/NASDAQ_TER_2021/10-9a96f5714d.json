Many of Teradyne\u2019s employees use alternatives to \ntraditional Monday-through-Friday work arrangements. These \ninclude part-time, hybrid work arrangements, job-shares, and \nvariable work schedules.\nFuture Plans  \u2013 Teradyne is committed to managing business activities that could potentially impact the environment in a responsible \nand effective manner. We will continually strive to improve our environmental performance consistent with other business objectives, \nto regularly set documented objectives and targets for the company and our supply chain and to monitor progress in achieving them.\nEnergy\n\u2022 Hold carbon emissions flat while \ncontinuing to grow company \nrevenues\n\u2022 Investigate additional renewable \nenergy options on and off-site and \ncarbon offset (scope 2 options) \nsources\n\u2022 Leverage and continue to invest in \nmore efficient facility infrastructure \ntechnologyClimate Change\n\u2022 Achieve net zero emissions for \nall North American Scope 2 \noperations by 2025 and investigating \nalternatives for global net zero \nemissions thereafter\nWater\n\u2022 Investigate and deploy water \nreduction measures where feasible\n\u2022 Implement best practices in water \nmanagementWaste\n\u2022 Investigate end-to-end waste/ \nrecycling streams at our facilities\n\u2022 Implement best practices in waste \nmanagement to increase the amount \nof waste diverted from landfill for  \nre-use, reclaim and recovery. \n\u2022 Continue to conduct external audits \non providers of waste and recycling \nservices to ensure they are in \ncompliance with applicable laws  \nand meet Teradyne standards.\nSpotlight on Universal Robots\nTeradyne\u2019s Universal Robot (UR) unit is the leader \nin the fast-growing Collaborative Robot industry.\nUR\u2019s cobots perform dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks, reducing \nsafety risk to workers and allowing them to focus on more \nproductive activities. UR cobots are reliable and easy to \nadapt to new tasks, important features for Rope Robotics, an \ninnovative Danish company using robotics to automate wind \nturbine blade maintenance. \nThe traditional approach to blade maintenance requires a \ntechnician to rappel down the length of a turbine blade in a \nclimbing harness while suspended high in the air, often in difficult \nweather conditions, to inspect and repair the blade. Rope \nRobotics has integrated a UR collaborative robot with a climbing \nvehicle, cameras, blade repair tools and creative software to \nautomate this laborious, repetitive and dangerous process.\nThe result is safer maintenance performed with less downtime \nfor the clean energy producing wind turbine.
