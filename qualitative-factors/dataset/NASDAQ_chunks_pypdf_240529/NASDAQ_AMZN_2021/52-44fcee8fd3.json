This includes \nrepresentation in the workplace, as well as in the media \nwe consume daily. The work is not easy, but we are \ncommitted to achieving real, lasting change. \nWorking closely with the University of Southern \nCalifornia\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, the \nInternational Documentary Association, and \nGamechanger Films, we created the Inclusion Playbook   \nto help people recognize biases that occur across the \nlifecycle of a series or movie\u2014from production to launch. \nThe Playbook explores this issue further by allowing \npeople to understand how they can meet the Amazon \nStudios Inclusion Policy. \nBy thinking about a story, casting, crewing up, and how \nto track and report inclusion successes, the Playbook \nis specifically designed to advance the visibility and \nresponsible depictions of underrepresented communities. \nWe view this as an evolving document that will be \nupdated over time, offering a much-needed tool to \nguide decision-making in creative hiring practices. \n\u201c This Inclusion Playbook adds important, \nadditional depth and guidance for our \ninternal teams and external partners to \nensure we continue to advance our shared \nmission of amplifying the best creatives \nand content around the world.\u201d\nLatasha Gillespie \nExecutive Head, DEI, Amazon Studios Our Goals for Increasing Representation\nIn 2021, we set a number of goals to guide our efforts and \nprogress for improved representation:\n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix 53  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2021.pdf", "page": 52, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
