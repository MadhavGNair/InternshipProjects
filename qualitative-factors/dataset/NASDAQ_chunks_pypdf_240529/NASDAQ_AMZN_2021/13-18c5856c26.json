Step up and accelerate \nemissions reductions so that we might \navoid the worst of the damages yet \nto come. It\u2019s encouraging that 300 \ncompanies are committed to working \ntogether to achieve net-zero carbon by \n2040 or sooner through The Climate \nPledge. But 300 companies are not \nenough to deliver the transformations \nwe need. I encourage all business leaders \nto get to grips with the science, translate \nit for their businesses, and enable the \nchanges we need without delay.\u201d\nChristiana Figueres\nFounding Partner of Global Optimism, Former \nExecutive Secretary of the UN Framework \nConvention on Climate Change\nProgress in 2021 \nIn 2021, 253 companies joined Amazon as signatories \nof The Climate Pledge\u2014an increase of over 700% in \nsignatories over the previous year.Collectively, The Climate Pledge signatories represent:\n300+ \nBusinesses and organizations $3.5T+\nIn global annual revenue \n8M+\nEmployees\n29\nCountries51\nIndustries Growing The \nClimate Pledge\nThe Climate Pledge is a commitment \nto reach net-zero carbon emissions \nby 2040\u201410 years ahead of the Paris \nAgreement.
