As \nour transportation businesses have expanded, we\u2019ve focused \non making our roads safer for our drivers and communities \nthrough innovative mobile and vehicle technology. \nArtificial intelligence reduces accidents by capturing data \nand providing real-time alerts for unsafe driving behavior, \nsuch as driver distraction, close following distance, stop sign \nand signal violations, and seatbelt infractions. Our 2021 \ninvestment of more than $130 million in new transportation \nsafety technology and programs resulted in nearly 50% \nfewer accidents since October 2020, and we are investing \nan incremental $100 million in 2022 to scale innovations in \nergonomics and driver assistance technologies across our \ndelivery fleet. Boosting Wellness and Well-Being \nWhen people are given the tools to take care of their \nwell-being at work and at home, they are not only less \nprone to injuries but they feel better, healthier, and happier. \nWe proactively help employees manage their health and \nwellness through a wide range of programs. We also provide \naccess to convenient health care through our Neighborhood \nHealth Centers , with 17 facilities located near fulfillment \ncenters in the U.S. as of 2021.\nOur innovative WorkingWell program uses academic \nresearch and certified athletic trainers to educate new \nemployees about their bodies, health, and wellness to help \nthem successfully adapt to working at Amazon.
