To identify these products, \nwe partner with a wide range of trusted and transparent \nexternal certifications . Qualifying products are labeled \nin shopping results and have additional sustainability \ninformation on their product pages. \nWe also developed our own certification, Compact by  \nDesign , to identify products that have a more efficient \ndesign. By eliminating excess air, water, and packaging, \nproducts require less packaging and become more efficient \nto ship. At scale, these small differences in product size and \nweight lead to significant carbon-emission reductions. \nOur Journey\nSince we launched Climate Pledge Friendly in 2020, the \nnumber of products included in the program has grown \nfrom 75,000 to more than 250,000 by the end of 2021. \nSearch rates for these products have also increased \nsignificantly during the same time frame. In 2021, more than \n370 million Climate Pledge Friendly units were shipped to \nAmazon customers and we welcomed 20 new third-party \nsustainability certifications to the program.
