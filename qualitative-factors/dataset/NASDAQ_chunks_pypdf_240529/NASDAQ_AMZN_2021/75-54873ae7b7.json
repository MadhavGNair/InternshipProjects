In a typical year, we will engage with dozens \nof shareholders, including our largest shareholders, two to \nthree times. This outreach is complementary to the hundreds \nof touchpoints our Investor Relations team has with \nshareholders each year. We find it beneficial to have ongoing \ndialogue with our shareholders throughout the year on a full \nrange of investor priorities. Depending on the circumstance, \nour lead director or another independent director may \nengage in these conversations with shareholders as well. \nIn 2021, as part of our corporate governance engagement, \nwe met with corporate governance representatives at \nshareholders owning over 35% of our stock (not counting \nthe approximately 13% voted by our founder and Executive \nChair) and responded to numerous letters from our investors. \nOur direct engagement with shareholders helps us better \nunderstand our shareholders\u2019 priorities, perspectives, and \nissues of concern while giving us an opportunity to elaborate \non our many initiatives and practices and to address the \nextent to which various aspects of these matters are (or \nare not) significant given the scope and nature of our \noperations and our existing practices. We take insights \nfrom this feedback into consideration and regularly share \nthem with our Board as we review and evolve our practices \nand disclosures. \n2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix 76  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2021.pdf", "page": 75, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
