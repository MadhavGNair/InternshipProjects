As part of this effort, in 2021, Amazon \nHandmade and Nest teamed up to support artisan and maker \nbusinesses to increase their sales and impact by leveraging \nthe power of Amazon\u2019s marketplace. Nest, a nonprofit \nsupporting the responsible growth and creative engagement \nof the artisan and maker economy to drive gender equity, \nsupports a growing network of over 1,600 artisan businesses \nacross 120 countries. The partnership between Nest and \nAmazon Handmade led to the launch of a dedicated cohort \nof Nest artisan businesses that were promoted through a \ndedicated gateway on Amazon Handmade.In the wake of COVID-19, providing artisan businesses with \na multichannel sales strategy is essential to their resilience \nand ability to withstand unprecedented times for small \nmaker businesses. For example, Espacio Handmade, based in \nAustin, Texas, is a women-owned leather goods business that \nwas highlighted in our 2020 Sustainability Report. Amazon \nHandmade also featured the business in the \u201cOur Favorite \nFinds\u201d section, and within weeks, Espacio Handmade had \nreceived hundreds of orders.
