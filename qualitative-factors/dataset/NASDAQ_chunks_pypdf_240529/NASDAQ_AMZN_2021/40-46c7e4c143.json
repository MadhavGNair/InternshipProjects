Strong Policies\nOur efforts are anchored in policies that apply across our \nbusiness\u2014from our own operations to our supply chain, \nand from the design and use of our technology to the \ncommunities we impact.

They are grounded \nin principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and \nsupply chain accountability. We engage with suppliers that are \ncommitted to these same principles; suppliers commit to these \nstandards as a condition of doing business with us. At least \nevery three years, in line with industry best practices, we review \nour Supply Chain Standards against policies developed by \nindustry associations. Additionally, we review these standards \nin consultation with human rights experts and organizations, \nincluding Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), Impactt \nLimited, International Center for Research on Women, Nest, \nthe Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), and UN Women.\nEmbedding Human Rights Into \nOur Business\nWe are committed to embedding human rights \nconsiderations into decision-making across our company and \ninto our policy and governance framework.
