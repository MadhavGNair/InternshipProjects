{"page_content": "4\nAbout the Company  \nHistory \nIT ALL STARTED WITH A FRIENDSHIP \u2026 Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and \nPatricia R.\u00a0Miller came upon a colorful idea while traveling together in 1982  \n(on a girls\u2019 trip, of\u00a0course!) Sitting in an airport during a long layover, Barb  \nand Pat observed the\u00a0need for more color and fun in women\u2019s luggage.  \nWhen they returned to\u00a0Indiana, they each borrowed $250 and cut pattens  \non a family ping pong table\u2009\u2014\u2009quickly\u00a0turning a simple idea into an iconic \nAmerican brand that is loved and carried\u00a0by millions of women today. \nVera Bradley has since grown into an internationally recognized, iconic lifestyle \nbrand providing beautiful solutions to its customers. Vera Bradley is a leading \ndesigner of women\u2019s handbags, backpacks, tote bags, luggage and travel items, \nfashion and\u00a0home accessories and unique gifts.

FAMILY EXPANDED  in July 2019 when we acquired  \na 75% interest in Creative Genius, Inc., which also operates under the name \nPura Vida Bracelets (\u201cPura Vida\u201d). Pura Vida, based in La Jolla, California,  \nis a rapidly growing, digitally native and highly engaging lifestyle brand that \ndeeply resonates with its loyal consumer following. \nMuch like Vera Bradley, Pura Vida began when two Southern California \nfriends\u00a0 \u2014 Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman\u00a0 \u2014 took a college graduation trip to \nCosta Rica. They came across two artisans named Jorge and Joaquin, whose \ncolorful string bracelets captured the simple beauty of Costa Rica. Sadly, Jorge \nand Joaquin were struggling to survive on their artisan wages, living with their \nfamily in a single room with three beds. Desperate to find some way to help, \nGriffin and Paul asked the artisans to make 400 bracelets to take home with \nthem. Paul and Griffin put the bracelets on display in a local boutique, selling 1982\n2019", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VRA_2020.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
