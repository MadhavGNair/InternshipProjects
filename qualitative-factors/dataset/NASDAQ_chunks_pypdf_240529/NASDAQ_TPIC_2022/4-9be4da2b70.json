The geopolitical and macroeconomic events of this past year have \nunderscored the need to accelerate the growth and transition to clean and \nrenewable energy. Governments around the world have taken decisive action \nthrough landmark plans and legislation such as REPowerEU and the Green  \nDeal Industrial Plan in Europe and the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States  \nto address these challenges. We believe these initiatives will accelerate the \ntransition to renewable energy and the pace at which we reach net-zero \nemissions globally.\nThe International Energy Agency expects global wind installs to reach almost \n400GW per year in 2030, more than three times larger than in 2022, with the  \ngoal of achieving zero emissions by 2050. TPI\u2019s mission is to deliver innovative \nand sustainable solutions to decarbonize and electrify the world by expanding  \nthe adoption of renewable energy. We intend to expand our manufacturing  \noutput over the next five years and have a significant role in addressing the  \nglobal energy crisis and climate change. With our focus on decarbonizing and \nelectrifying the world, we strive to set the \u201cESG Gold Standard.\u201d To accomplish \nthis, we have developed long-term ESG goals and continue to make progress \ntoward achieving them.
