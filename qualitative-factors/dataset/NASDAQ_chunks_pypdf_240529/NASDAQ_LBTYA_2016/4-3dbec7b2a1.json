As part of a detailed materiality assessment in 2014, we carried out an industry peer and media review, interviewed 11 sustainability experts, surveyed 200 employees and over 6,000 customers  and consulted with senior management. The issues we identified and  prioritized, along with the feedback we received, shapes our current CR strategy.\nIt\u2019s important that we continue engaging with our stakeholders and stay up-to-date \nwith their most pressing issues. That way, we can adapt our strategy to focus on the key topics relevant to them and to our business. Using this process, we\u2019ve recently conducted a new materiality review, the results of which will be published in 2017.\nGRI: 102-46, 102-47", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2016.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
