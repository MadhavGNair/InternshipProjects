{"page_content": "About this report\nWelcome to Liberty Global\u2019s 2016 Corporate Responsibility (CR) \nSummary Report. This annual report provides an overview of our economic, social and environmental impacts and performance. Additional details, including our latest stories, can be found on our website: www.libertyglobal.com/cr .\n This report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option. All data in this report covers the period January 1 to December 31, 2016 unless otherwise stated. We report on our global operations, including Virgin Media, operations under the UPC brand, Unitymedia, Telenet, VTR and Liberty Puerto Rico.\nOur policy is to include any new subsidiaries that have been \nacquired in the first six months of the reporting period. Therefore, we include the recent acquisition of BASE in Belgium (completed in February 2016) and of Tullamore Beta Limited, the parent of TV3, in Ireland (completed in December 2015) in our 2016 data. In May 2016, we completed the Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC) acquisition. Due to the nature and size  \nof CWC, a readiness review of its 2016 data will be carried out prior to inclusion of CWC within our 2017 reporting. Therefore,  \nwe have excluded CWC from this report. In terms of disposals, our policy is to exclude any subsidiaries where we no longer have operational control during the reporting period. In December 2016, Liberty Global and Vodafone formed a joint venture in the Netherlands, therefore, we have excluded Ziggo Group Holding from our 2016 reporting. We engaged KPMG LLP to perform independent limited assurance, reporting to Liberty Global plc, using the assurance standards ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410, of the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions data presented in Liberty Global plc\u2019s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ending December 31, 2016.
