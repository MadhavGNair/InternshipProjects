Our objective is  \nto partner with management teams, when applicable, to develop a systematic process to  \ndevelop, track and monitor performance against ESG goals and drive tangible impact at our \nportfolio companies. INTEGRATING ESG    \nOur approach to ESG stems from our culture of collaboration. Our ESG strategic plan was developed by a volunteer task force that included professionals from all levels of our organization. Through many working sessions with the task force, Executive Leadership and an ESG Stakeholder Group, along with a group-wide survey, we aligned on four strategic priorities: Employee Health & Safety, DEI, Climate Change and Employee Engagement. Following teach-ins with the full Corporate Private Equity team on our revamped ESG program, senior investment professionals volunteered to serve as ESG Champions for each of these initiatives as we move from strategy to execution. \nWith an approach to ESG that is driven by our \ninvestment professionals, our ESG program is owned and managed by the deal team through the lifecycle of a transaction: from diligence to ownership and through exit. We believe this direct ownership model will make our ESG efforts more impactful and result in consistent dialogue and active monitoring with our management teams and at the board level.\u201c\n W\ne have taken a markedly different approach \nto ESG in 2020. The strategy refresh was led by a diverse set of my investment team colleagues versus being siloed with one dedicated ESG person. ESG is shifting from being a set of individual initiatives to being woven into the fabric of our culture.\u201d   Abraham Zilkha  \nPartner,  \nPrivate Equity Group\u201c I t is critical that ESG is driven by our \ninvestment team; this ensures ownership and accountability as we continue to make ESG an active and ongoing dialogue at the company and board level. \u201d  \n David Ricanati  \nPartner,  \nPrivate Equity Group\nEMBEDDING ESG IN CORPORATE PRIVATE EQUITY\nSOURCING\n\u2022 \n Ap\nply Ares responsible \ninvestment strategy \nscreening framework.\n\u2022 \n N\negative screen for \nopportunities involving harmful products/services.\n\u2022 \n E\nscalate potential \ninvestments in industries that have a possible adverse ESG impact.
