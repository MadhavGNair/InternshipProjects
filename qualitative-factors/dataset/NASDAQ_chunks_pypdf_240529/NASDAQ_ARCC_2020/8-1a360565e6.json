To this end, we made it clear that we had no plans to eliminate roles. We pivoted to remote work and made coming on-site, to the extent it was available, optional. We used multiple communication channels to keep people informed. We listened to our employees\u2019 needs, including through several surveys and townhalls with senior leadership, and adapted to support them. In terms of health and safety, we implemented policies and controls to minimize transmission risk for team members who wished to come on-site. We also made available, at no-cost, home fitness and mental health resources, while hosting webinars and expert speakers across a range of disciplines and sponsoring virtual team-building events to help keep our employees motivated and inspired. 2020 HIGHLIGHTS\nIn 2020, we were recognized as a Great Place to Work by Great Place to Work U.S., based on employee feedback across a range of dimensions.
