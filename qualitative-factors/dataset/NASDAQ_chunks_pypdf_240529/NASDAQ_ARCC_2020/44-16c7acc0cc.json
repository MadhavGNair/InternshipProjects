We have adopted an ethics hotline (also called a Whistleblower Hotline) hosted by an independent third party that allows for open reporting or anonymous and confidential reporting, which is available to all our people globally. This supports our employees in coming forward with concerns about unethical or unlawful behavior. Reporting through the hotline can be done anonymously 24/7 via web-based form or via dedicated local phone numbers for our offices globally (in local languages). All incidents are reviewed by the Global Chief Compliance Officer and escalated appropriately depending on the nature of the complaint. On an annual basis, all employees certify their understanding of policies and code of conduct, which includes the Ethics Hotline. Through this annual certification, we seek to clearly communicate that any employee who comes forward with a complaint will not be subject to retaliation as a result of their reporting violations through the hotline. In addition, our external auditors review our Whistleblower logs at least annually.DISCLOSURE NUMBER DISCLOSURE TITLE DESCRIPTION INDEX & INFORMATION\n44\nINTRODUCTION CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nCONCLUSION & \nLOOKING FORWARD DISCLOSURES END NOTES\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2020.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
