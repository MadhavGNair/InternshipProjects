For each of our material ESG issues, we  \nstrive towards five markers of sustainability  \nbest practice: \n\u2022  \n Es\ntablish  clear accountability by identifying  \na subject matter owner. \n\u2022   P\nublish key ESG disclosures. \n\u2022   C\nlearly communicate  the issue\u2019s relevance to \nour business and how we approach managing it.\n\u2022   D\nevelop policies and procedures   \nwith relevant back-up documentation to \ndemonstrate follow-through.\n\u2022   D\nefine annual initiatives and targets to \nmeasure continuous improvement.\n\u2022   W\nhere appropriate, develop  multi-year \nobjectives and targets.\nWe build momentum and year-on-year progress by integrating ESG objectives into our internal budgeting processes and communicating our key accomplishments and challenges through this annual sustainability report.2020 HIGHLIGHTS\nA YEAR OF GREAT CHANGE\nThe past year was marked by unprecedented \nmoments on both a global and local scale.
