For our 2021 U.S. pipeline intern class, we aspired for greater diversity. We established a Campus Recruitment and Development Committee, set ambitious diversity goals, launched an Early Pipeline Program for Women in Alternatives, and deepened our diversity partnerships. As a result, our 2021 pipeline intern class reflects significantly higher diversity levels relative to our 2020 class - 41% female and 59% ethnically diverse, with 28% underrepresented minorities (near population-level representation).OUR APPROACH \nIn 2017, we formalized our DEI initiatives by channeling the passion of our employees across leadership positions and functions to form a DEI Council.
