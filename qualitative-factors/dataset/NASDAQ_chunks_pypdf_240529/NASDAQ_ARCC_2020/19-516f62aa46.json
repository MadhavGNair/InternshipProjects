{"page_content": "Direct Lending\nOUR DIRECT LENDING STRATEGY  \nWe are one of the largest non-bank lenders to middle-market \ncompanies in the world, with $98.8 billion7 of assets under \nmanagement as of December 31, 2020 comprising ~500 existing borrowers. Our 213 investment professionals across 14 offices in the U.S. and Europe offer flexible capital solutions to ~830 financial sponsors and corporates to successfully grow and operate their businesses. Given this span of influence, we believe we are well positioned to catalyze positive change through the integration of ESG in our investment process.INTEGRATING ESG      \nBuilding on Ares\u2019 platform-wide objectives for ESG integration, we identified four goals tailored specifically to Direct Lending:\n1.\n  \nEnhance  our ability to identify and evaluate \npotential risks pre-investment, as well as to \neffectively monitor these risks throughout the investment horizon. \n2.\n  \nPromote  improvements in ESG performance \nin our portfolio companies to reduce risk and improve long-term performance.\n3.\n  \nServe  as a resource to middle-market \ncompanies and their sponsors regarding ESG best practices.\n4.\n  \nProvide  detailed reporting to our \ninvestors, giving them confidence that our ESG processes are being implemented appropriately. \nImportantly, proper ESG integration allows us to better assess credit quality and price the risk in a given investment. In 2020, we improved our approach to integrating ESG into the investment decisions of our Direct Lending strategies. Our aim was to ensure it is clear, systematic and consistent from sourcing to exit across the platform. In spring 2020, a global cross-functional Direct Lending team of ESG Champions represented by ~20 investment, portfolio management, investor relations and technology professionals volunteered to partner with the ESG Team to create a differentiated and tailored process across geographies.\nOur Direct Lending ESG Champions embraced \nour firmwide ESG principles and objectives while carefully weaving the approach into a bespoke investment process, highlighted in the table to the left. The process culminated in the ESG Champions walking their investment and portfolio management colleagues through the steps in a team-wide teach-in in August. \nEMBEDDING ESG IN DIRECT LENDING\nSOURCING\n\u2022 \n A\npply Responsible \nInvestment firmwide \nscreening framework.\n\u2022 \n N\negative screen for \nopportunities involving harmful products/services.\n\u2022 \n E\nscalate potential \ninvestments in industries that have a possible adverse ESG impact.
