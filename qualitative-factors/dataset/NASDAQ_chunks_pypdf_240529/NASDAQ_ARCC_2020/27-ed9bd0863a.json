We believe that it is vital for companies to transparently disclose their sustainability performance to key stakeholders. Given the significant impact that sustainability topics play on a business, this information would ideally be as widely disclosed as financial performance detail. While a universal standard for measuring and reporting on sustainability topics has not been formally adopted, 2020 featured some momentous steps towards putting that reality in motion.\nWith the proposed creation of the \nSustainability Standards Board by the IFRS Foundation, the body that oversees the work of the International Accounting Standards Board in setting financial reporting for companies around the world, a single body is likely to emerge with the expertise and authority to lead the implementation of sustainability reporting in the right direction. Additionally, \nDisclosures \nthe recent partnership between SASB, GRI, CDP, the Climate Disclosures Standards Board and the International Integrated Reporting Council to publish a paper on sustainability reporting displays the much-needed collaboration between organizations to establish clear and widely used sustainability standards.\nWe are very excited to continue the dialogue \non our sustainability practices through this report and disclosures as well as through more integrated reporting in the future. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US     \nIn the tables on the following pages, we have reported against key sustainability topics based on the guidelines of GRI and SASB. In July 2020, these two organizations announced their plan to collaborate in an effort to provide clarity in the sustainability disclosure process. We plan to keep abreast of the developments in sustainability disclosure so that we can provide the most pertinent information to our stakeholders in a digestible manner.\n27\nINTRODUCTION CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nEND NOTES DISCLOSURESCONCLUSION & \nLOOKING FORWARD", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2020.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
