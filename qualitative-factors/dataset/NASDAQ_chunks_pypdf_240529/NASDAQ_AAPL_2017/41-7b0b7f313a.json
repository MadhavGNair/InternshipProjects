We hit this milestone in January 2013, when we began \nserving the data center with energy sourced primarily from California wind \npower. We\u2019re acquiring this energy directly from the wholesale market \nthrough California\u2019s Direct Access program. Late in 2017, when we antici -\npate the 130-megawatt California Flats solar project in Monterey County, \nCalifornia, to come online, we\u2019ll use Direct Access to supply power from \nthat project directly to our data center as well as other Apple facilities in \nCalifornia.\nNewark, California\u2014100% renewable since opening January 2013\nPacific Gas & Electric Default Grid Mix Apple Actual Renewable Energy Use\nNatural Gas 25% Bundled Grid (mostly wind) 84%\nNuclear 23% Grid (mostly wind) 16%\nOther/Unspecified 22%\nRenewable 30%\n2016 Default Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)24,993 2016 Effective Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)0\nhttps://www.pge.com/pge_global/common/pdfs/your-  \naccount/your-bill/understand-your-bill/bill-inserts/  \n2016/11.16_PowerContent.pdfActual fiscal year 2016 energy data\nPrineville, Oregon\nTo support our Prineville data center, we recently signed a 200-megawatt \npower purchase agreement for a new Oregon wind farm, the Montague \nWind Power Project, set to come online by the end of 2018. This is our \nfirst Apple-created wind project. And it\u2019s our largest project to date,  \nproducing over 560 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy \na year. Additionally, we executed a power purchase agreement for the \n56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II PV array located just a few miles from \nour data center. The project comes online at the end of this year and \nwill produce 140 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy a year.
