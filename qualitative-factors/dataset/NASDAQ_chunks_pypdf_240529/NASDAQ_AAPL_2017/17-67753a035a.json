{"page_content": "18\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2017 Progress Report, Covering FY2016\nBut sourcing isn\u2019t enough\u2014we want to recover as much tin as we\u2019re using \nand make sure it\u2019s put back into the world\u2019s supply. Unfortunately, tin is \nnot recovered by all electronics recyclers. So we are working to identify tin \nrecyclers and ensure that the material is being consistently recovered and \nrecycled from our products. To start, we are sending iPhone\u00a06\u00a0main logic \nboards recovered by Liam to a recycler who\u00a0can reclaim the tin\u00a0in addition \nto the copper and precious metals. We are now looking for ways to do this \non a larger scale for tin\u2014and apply what we\u2019ve learned to other materials. \nFor example, we\u2019re experimenting with ways to recover cobalt from our \nlithium-ion batteries and use recycled cobalt.\nThroughout this process, we\u2019re learning a lot about how to create closed-\nloop supply chains. For some materials, sourcing recycled content will be \nsufficient as long as we ensure the same amount is recovered, recycled, \nand put back on the market. Where recycled content isn\u2019t available at \nthe desired quality, we can drive improvements in recycling technologies \nand a tighter closed loop\u2014such as using material from old Apple devices \nto build new ones. And when there are materials for which recycling \ntechnologies don\u2019t yet exist, we\u2019ll need to invest in research and other \ntechnology solutions.For every 100,000 iPhone 6 \ndevices, Liam has the potential \nto recover the following  \nmaterials:\nAluminum (1900 kg)  \nCopper (800 kg)  \nGold (0.3 kg)  \nPlatinum Group Metals (0.4 kg)  \nSilver (7 kg)  \nTin (55 kg)  \nRare Earth Elements (24 kg)  \nCobalt (550 kg)  \nTungsten (3.5 kg)  \nTantalum (2.5 kg)\nLiam is a line of robots that  \ndisassembles iPhone 6 into  \nindividual components, making  \nit easier to recover finite  \nresources such as aluminum, \ntungsten, and cobalt.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2017.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
