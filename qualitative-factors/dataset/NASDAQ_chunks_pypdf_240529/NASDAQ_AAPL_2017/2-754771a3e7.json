{"page_content": "Can we power a global business with the sun, wind, and water?\nCan we get 100 percent of our supply chain to move to 100 percent \nrenewable energy?\nCan we one day stop mining the earth altogether?\nCan we use only 100 percent recycled and responsibly sourced  \npaper in our packaging?\nCan we improve on the world\u2019s best materials?\nThat\u2019s Apple: asking bold questions, tackling big problems, and relentlessly \ninnovating to solve them. The approach also lies at the heart of our global \nenvironmental strategy\u2014driving us to make not just the best products in \nthe world, but the best products for the world.\nApple\u2019s 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report, covering fiscal year \n2016, is our tenth annual update. It highlights the ambitions we have set \nfor ourselves and our progress toward meeting them. We remain focused \non three priorities through which we\u2014and our stakeholders\u2014believe \nApple can make the biggest difference: \n\u2022 Reduce our impact on climate change by using renewable energy  \nsources and driving energy efficiency in our products and facilities. \n\u2022 Conserve precious resources so we all can thrive. \n\u2022 Pioneer the use of safer materials in our products and processes.\nWe still have a long way to go and a lot to learn. But we\u2019re making \ntremendous progress.\nIn 2016, 96 percent of the electricity used at our global facilities came  \nfrom renewable energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 \nmetric tons. We\u2019re 100 percent renewable in 24 countries\u2014and all of \nApple\u2019s data centers. Our work is led by Lisa Jackson, \nApple\u2019s Vice President of Environment, \nPolicy and Social Initiatives, reporting \ndirectly to CEO Tim Cook. The Office of \nEnvironment, Policy and Social Initiatives \nworks with teams across Apple to set \nstrategy, engage stakeholders, and \ncommunicate progress. Our integrated \napproach means that decisions about \nApple values, including environment, are \nreviewed and supported at the highest \nlevels of the company. \n3\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2017 Progress Report, Covering FY2016\nEnvironmental Responsibility at Apple\nT o ask less of the planet,  \nwe\u2019re asking more of ourselves.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2017.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
