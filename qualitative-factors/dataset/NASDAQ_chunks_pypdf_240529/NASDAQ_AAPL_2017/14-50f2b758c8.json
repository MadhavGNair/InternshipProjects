Mac mini consumes 40 percent less \npower when idle than the previous generation. And you can charge your \niPhone 7 once a day for a year for only 61 cents.\u2075 These advancements  \nare bringing down our overall carbon footprint and your electricity bill at \nthe same time.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProduct Transportation and Recycling\nWe\u2019re taking responsibility for shipping \nand recycling.\nWe include all the energy used for shipping and recycling in our carbon \nfootprint. So we make our devices lighter and our packaging smaller to \nconsume less fuel when they\u2019re transported by air and sea. Because it\u2019s \nbetter for the environment, we ship by sea as often as we can. We\u2019re also \nadjusting our recycling practices. When collecting end of life products, \nwe maximize the environmental benefits of recycling by weighing the \navailability of local recovery technology with the impacts of shipping \nwaste. When we have to ship recycled materials, we do it responsibly. \nAnd nothing is discarded unsafely.
