The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 ended on September 24, 2016, September 26, 2015,  \nand September 27, 2014, respectively, and each spanned 52 weeks.\n\u00b9As reported in Apple\u2019s Annual Report filed with the SEC (Form 10-K) for the fiscal year ending September 24, 2016 (fiscal year 2016).\n\u00b2Scope 1 emissions for fiscal year 2016 include 261,580 gallons of diesel use in emergency back up generators at data centers and 21,840 kg of propane in corporate offices. Scope 1 emissions for fiscal year 2016 now \ninclude natural gas use at distribution centers.\n\u00b3In fiscal year 2015, we adjusted our methodology to better reflect locations where natural gas is used. We estimate natural gas usage in offices and retail stores where we are not billed based on usage (e.g., leased\noffice space or retail stores within malls). This more accurate methodology resulted in a decrease in emissions in fiscal year 2015.\n\u2074Beginning in fiscal year 2016, we include distribution centers and colocation facilities as part of Apple\u2019s electricity use and association greenhouse gas emissions. We had previously reported colocation center \nelectricity use separately.\n\u2075Scope 3 emissions reported in this table include only those emissions associated with employee commute and business travel, calculated by employee miles traveled. Scope 3 emissions associated with product\nlife-cycle emissions are disclosed separately. \n\u2076In fiscal year 2015, we adjusted our methodology to reflect actual travel instead of booked travel. Using this more accurate methodology revealed overestimates for previous years.\n\u2077Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2011.\n\u2078We calculate and report our progress toward 100 percent renewable energy by calendar year. In calendar year 2016, we used 1,572 million kilowatt-hours of electricity worldwide.\n\u2079Prior to fiscal year 2015, composted quantities were reported as part of the \u201crecycled\u201d figure.Facilities Environmental Key  \nPerformance Indicators \nThe following table summarizes key environmental performance  \nindicators relating to Apple\u2019s global facilities, including our data  \ncenters, corporate offices, and almost 490 Apple Stores, together  \noccupied by 116,000 Apple employees.\u00b9 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2017.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
