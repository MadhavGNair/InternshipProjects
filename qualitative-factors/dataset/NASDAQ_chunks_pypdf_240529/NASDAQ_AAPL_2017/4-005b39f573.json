We\u2019re sourcing lower-\ncarbon materials to make our devices, we\u2019re partnering with suppliers  \nto add clean energy to their facilities, and we produce and procure  \nclean, renewable energy for 96 percent of the electricity used at our \nglobal facilities.\nIn 2016, our comprehensive carbon footprint was 29.5 million metric \ntons, compared with 38.4 million the year before. A variety of factors \ncontributed to the 23 percent decline, including benefits of our \nenvironmental programs (such as reduced emissions from\u00a0aluminum \nmanufacturing and installing clean energy in our supply chain), a  \nyear-over-year decline in the total number of products sold, and changes \nto our carbon footprint calculations. Every year we refine our product \nlife cycle analysis, moving from industry-average data to more\u00a0Apple-\nspecific data whenever possible, and in 2016 we developed more detailed \ninformation about the carbon intensity of the integrated circuits we use. \nWithout the methodology changes, our carbon footprint would have \ndeclined by 10 percent.2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016137.2126.7\n124.1122.1\n114.1\n97\nCarbon emissions per product (kg)  \nWe\u2019ve decreased carbon emissions per  \nproduct every  year since 2011.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2017.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
