To support this facility, we partnered with the local \nutility, the Salt River Project, to build the 50-megawatt Bonnybrooke solar \narray, which became operational in October 2016. This project produces \nover 147 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy a year, which \nmore than fully matches the energy used by the data center.\nMesa Arizona\u2014100% renewable since opening March 2017*\nSalt River Project (SRP) Default Grid Mix Apple Actual Renewable Energy Use\nCoal 53% SRP Solar PV Purchase 100%\nNuclear 18%\nNatural Gas/Other 17%\nRenewable 12%\n2016 Default Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)7601 2016 Effective Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)0\nhttps://www.srpnet.com/about/stations/pdfx/2014irp.pdf Actual fiscal year 2016 energy data\n*Apple took operational control of the building in October 2015 and converted it to a data center that began servicing customers in  \nMarch 2017.\nViborg, Denmark\nWe\u2019re currently constructing a new data center running on 100 percent \nrenewable energy in Denmark\u2019s central Jutland region. Due to its proximity \nto one of Denmark\u2019s largest electrical substations, the data center won\u2019t \nrequire back-up generators, which typically run on diesel and require \nperiodic testing and burning of fuel. The facility is designed to capture \nexcess heat from its equipment and conduct it into the local district \nheating system to help warm homes in the community.
