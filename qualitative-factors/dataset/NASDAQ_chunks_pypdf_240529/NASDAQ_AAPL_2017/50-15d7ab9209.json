This review and verification focuses on \nScope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse \nGas Protocol \u2013 Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard).

The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management \u2013 Life cycle assessment \u2013 Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: \nGreenhouse gases -- Part 3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification \nof greenhouse gas assertions.  \nThe review of the corporate annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria: \n\uf0a7The system, boundaries and functional unit are clearly defined \n\uf0a7Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate \n\uf0a7Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used \nare adequately disclosed \n51", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2017.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
