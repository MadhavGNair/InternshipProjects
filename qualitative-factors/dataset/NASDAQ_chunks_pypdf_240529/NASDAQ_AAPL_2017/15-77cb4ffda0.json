Materials are mined, manufactured as \nproducts, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts \nover and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products. \nWe believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where \nproducts are built using only renewable resources or recycled material. \nWe already have programs in place to ensure the finite materials we use \nin our products are sourced responsibly through strict standards and \nprograms on the ground that drive positive change.\u00a0We\u2019re also challenging \nourselves to one day end our reliance on mining altogether. To start, we\u2019re \nencouraging more customers to recycle their old devices through Apple \nRenew. And we\u2019re piloting innovative new recycling techniques, like our \nline of disassembly robots, so we can put reclaimed materials to better \nuse in new products. It\u2019s an ambitious goal that will require many years \nof collaboration across multiple Apple teams, our suppliers, and specialty \nrecyclers\u2014but our work is already under way.\nClosing the loop in our supply chainResources\nIn the future, can we make  \nproducts without taking finite  \nresources from the earth?
