So we assess all of our products in our \nReliability Testing Lab, using rigorous testing methods that simulate our \ncustomers\u2019 real-world experiences with their devices. For example, we \nanalyze how devices stand up to extreme heat and cold, exposure to water \nand everyday chemicals, and scratching tests from materials like steel wool \nand denim. In addition to industry-standard measures, we also devise our \nown tests and even build custom testing machinery. We design these tests \nbased on our studies of user behavior and by analyzing returned products \nto fully understand any problems.\nIn the event that something does break, we have programs like AppleCare \nand Apple-certified repair services to help our customers use their \ndevices longer. We also release regular free software updates that keep \nour products current and extend their lives as long as possible. And we \ndesign those software updates to be compatible with older generations \nof products. macOS Sierra, for example, is compatible with Mac models \ndating back to late 2009. And when customers decide to upgrade to new \ndevices, the old ones often have new lives with friends or family, or in the \nrefurbished market through programs like Apple Renew.To ensure that they can stand up to \nrepeated use, the keys on MacBook \nare pressed millions of times.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2017.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
