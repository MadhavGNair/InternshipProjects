It translates into  \n  one number the impact of different greenhouse gases based on their potential to contribute to climate  \n  change.\n \u00b3 Greenhouse gas equivalencies calculated using the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator:  \n  www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator.\n \u2074 Based on sales-weighted averages.\n \u2075 Based on the average residential cost of electricity in the U.S. in 2015; includes customer use scenarios  \n  and power consumed by the power adapter when disconnected from the iPhone.\n \u2076 Based on the EPA ENERGY STAR database for Desktop Computers as of February 7, 2017.\n \u2077 The tin in the solder has been verified by a third party to be 100 percent recycled. As of April 2017, we\u2019re  \n  transitioning iPhone 6s production to use 100 percent recycled tin solder for the main logic board.\n \u2078 Based on expected equivalent fiber production from our forestry projects and virgin fiber used for Apple  \n  product packaging. To determine the output of Apple\u2019s projects, we work with our partners to understand  \n  the productive potential of these working forests. The forest management plans required to achieve or  \n  maintain certification limit harvest volumes to sustainable levels. We use these potential harvest volumes  \n  to estimate the sustainable productive capacity of these forests.\n \u2079 Anhui, Fujian, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, and Yunnan provinces.\n \u00b9\u2070 Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of power cords in India and  \n  South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates repla cement.\n \n\u00a9 2017 Apple Inc.
