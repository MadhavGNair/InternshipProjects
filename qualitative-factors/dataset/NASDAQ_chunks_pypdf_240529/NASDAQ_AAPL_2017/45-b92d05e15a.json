This allows us to demonstrate the savings resulting from our renewable energy program.\n\u00b2Apple\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for \ncalculating market-based emissions.\n\u00b3Over the past two years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in FY2016, \nwe are reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to FY2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on \nmaximum contract capacity quantities.\nRegional Energy Use at Apple\u2019s Colocation Facilities  \n(Fiscal Year 2016)       \n    \nEnergy Use\n(kWh)Renewable Energy\n(kWh)% \nRenewable Energy\nU.S. 127,286,720 127,286,720 100%\nEurope 27,576,768 27,576,768 100%\nAPAC 24,750,670 21,906,038 89%*\nOther 591,342 0 0%\nFY2016 Total 180,205,500 176,769,526 98%\n*This value became 100 percent starting January 2016, bringing the total renewable energy figure to 99 percent for calendar year 2016.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2017.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
