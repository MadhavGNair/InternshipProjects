{"page_content": "ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN MANUFACTURING \nWe aim to decrease the energy intensity of our operations and shift to renewable energy sources where possible\ufffd To \nthat end, we are taking the following steps: \n \u25a0We are installing solar panels on the rooftop of Israel\u2019s factory in Kiryat Gat\ufffd \n \u25a0We are setting up EV charging stations in our HQ Kornit Digital Israel parking lots and in the ink plant in Kiryat Gat \nand expect them to be completed during 2022\ufffd\n \u25a0Our manufacturing processes in all our facilities utilize energy sourced exclusively from local electricity corporations\ufffd  \n \u25a0Some Research & Development (R&D) processes require mild heating for drying purposes, for which we use propane \ngas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) and natural gas. We also consume a small amount of diesel in our Israeli operation \nas fuel for backup generators\ufffd\nIn last year\u2019s report, we stated that one of our goals was the reduction of electricity consumption generated by fossil \nfuels by using solar energy. Although a specific KPI for this topic was not set in our new strategic framework, this topic \nwill be covered by this year's climate action and energy efficiency plan.\nWe are consistently improving our energy consumption measurement\ufffd Some of the year-over-year increases in energy \nconsumption shown in the table below are due to changes in what and how we are measuring\ufffd As we have improved \nour measurement process, we have been able to capture more data, which means in some cases our metrics will \nincrease even if our environmental impact has decreased over that same time period\ufffd We are taking a long-term \napproach to ESG measurement and will continue to refine our processes and metrics each year in our reporting cycle.\n05,00010,00015,00020,00025,000\n020406080100GJ\nGJ\n2020 2020 2021 202115,775 \nGJ23,866.84 \nGJ\n81.6 GJ \n74.12 GJTotal Energy Consumption Energy Intensity\n(per million USD revenues)\nENERGY SOURCES BREAKDOWN \nEnergy source Energy consumption in 2020 Energy consumption in 2021\nPurchased electricity from grid 3,577,970 kWh 3,953,667 kWh\nPropane gas 9,020 kg 9,036 kg\nDiesel 3,750 liters 12,264  liters\nTransportation petrol and diesel 20,340 liters 222,697 liters\nNatural gas   15,749 therms 16,781 thermsENERGY CONSUMPTIONBE THE CHANGE\n2021 saw a spike in overall energy consumption due to major construction efforts on a new factory\ufffd However, in terms of energy intensity, \non which we continue to be focused, there has been steady improvement\ufffd\n35", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KRNT_2021.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
