inherently safer \nand more sustainable than traditional printing \nmethods, and our ink contains less occupational \nmonitored chemicals than standard textile inks\ufffd \nClean Water and Sanitation: \nEnsure availability and \nsustainable management \nof water and sanitation for \nall6.4Our products enable our customers to increase their \nproduction processes\u2019 water-efficiency, leading to \nthe conservation of tens of millions of liters of water \nannually\ufffd1\nAffordable and Clean \nEnergy: Ensure access \nto affordable, reliable, \nsustainable, and modern \nenergy for all7.2We are gradually increasing the share of renewable \nenergy use at our sites by installing solar panels on \nour factory rooftop and assessing other renewable \nenergy sources\ufffd \nInnovation and \nInfrastructure: Build resilient \ninfrastructure, promote \ninclusive and sustainable \nindustrialization, and foster \ninnovation9.4In alignment with our mission to write the operating \nsystem for on-demand sustainable fashion and lead \nin innovation, our products enable our customers \nto implement sustainable solutions to key issues in \ntheir infrastructure and processes\ufffd For example, our \nunique wet-on-wet process produces less waste and \nuses water-based inks to produce myriad printing \ntechniques on a broad range of fabric substrates, \ndirect to garment or textile\ufffd\nResponsible Consumption: \nEnsure sustainable \nconsumption and \nproduction patterns12.2\n12.4\n12.5In addition to enabling eco-friendly production \nprocesses with technology and consumables \nthat use less water, reduce waste, and minimize \ncarbon footprint, Kornit technology solutions enable \nsustainable production on demand, which eliminates \noverproduction of apparel and other textile goods\ufffd COMMITMENT TO THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs)\nWe are committed to supporting the UN SDGs that are relevant to our business activity and the fashion industry. \nThe following goals reflect our impact on promoting sustainable production practices through our operations and \nproduct offerings:\n1 Based on an LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) performed for the Atlas Max and the Presto S, as published in our 2020 Impact Report\ufffd Calculations are based \npartly on various assumptions relying on commonly used figures for the fa shion industry.\n01\nNO
