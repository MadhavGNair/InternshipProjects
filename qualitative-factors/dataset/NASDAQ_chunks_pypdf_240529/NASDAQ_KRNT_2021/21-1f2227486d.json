{"page_content": "PROTECTING THE PLANET \nDriven by creativity and expression, fashion is one of the largest and most influential industries. It is also responsible \nfor extreme environmental damage\ufffd Excessive rates of greenhouse gas emissions, and unrestrained use of natural \nresources-such as land and water-are adversely impacting the environment, rendering this industry a notorious \ncontributor to the climate crisis\ufffd \nKornit offers digital solutions for on-demand sustainable fashion manufacturing that greatly reduce the environmental \nimpacts associated with traditional production methods\ufffd We are writing the operating system for on-demand fashion \nproduction, enabling our customers to create only what is needed and minimize waste\ufffd\nELIMINATING OVERPRODUCTION  \nApparel overproduction is one of the most pressing issues the fashion industry faces\ufffd An estimated 30% of manufactured \ngarments are considered overproduction every year6\ufffd This surplus requires tremendous amounts of resources, such \nas water, energy, chemicals, packaging material, and ultimately shipping\ufffd The unfortunate result is potentially massive \namounts of greenhouse gas emissions, wastewater, and mounds of waste\ufffd\nKornit technologies enable on-demand, sustainable fashion, fundamentally eliminating overproduction and reducing \nthe need for inventories\ufffd Our technology\u2019s sustainable production processes use less water, reduce waste, and minimize \ncarbon emissions, while providing the ability to eliminate the overproduction of apparel and other textile goods\ufffd  \nAccording to an internal assessment we conducted in 2020, by 2026*, Kornit\u2019s technology could reduce the overproduction \nof approximately 1\ufffd1B items by enabling on-demand production of decorated apparel and home d\u00e9cor items instead \nof production by traditional printing methods\ufffd\nENABLE THE CHANGE\n*See next page\ufffd\n6 Pulse of the Fashion Industry 2017, GFI, BCG\ufffd\nENDANGERED HABITAT CONSERVATION   \nWith the aid of Ecologi, a platform for climate action, Kornit has contributed to peatland conservation in Indonesia.  \nPeatlands are unique habitats that store massive amounts of carbon, with stocks below ground amounting to \nup to 20 times the amount stored in trees and vegetation. Indonesia contains some 36% of the world\u2019s tropical \npeatlands, which are increasingly being destroyed to make room for plantation crops including oil palm and \nacacia. The Rimba Raya REDD+ project, supported by Kornit, protects 64,500 hectares of lowland peat swamp \nforest from conversion to oil palm plantations, ensuring the continued survival of this natural habitat for over \n120 threatened and endangered species, and keeping the carbon stored in the trees and peatland locked away. \n22", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KRNT_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
