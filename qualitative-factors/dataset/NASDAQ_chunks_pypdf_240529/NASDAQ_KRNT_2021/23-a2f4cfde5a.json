It's also responsible for significant \nwater pollution\ufffd Textile dyeing is considered the second largest polluter of water globally8\ufffd \nKornit technologies offer a water-efficient and low-pollution solution that enables high-level textile printing to help \nthe industry meet its water conservation and stewardship goals. Our digital printing solutions consume significantly \nless water than analog screen-printing processes that involve multiple stages, including repeated washing between \neach step\ufffd This results in wastewater that cannot be reused and is considered hazardous waste, which can lead to \ncontamination of water sources\ufffdENABLE THE CHANGE\n* Compared to printing the same amount in traditional printing methods\ufffd The calculation assumes that one Presto MAX machine prints an average \nof 800,000 square meters of fabrics annually\ufffd\n \n7  \u201cUN Launches Drive to Highlight Environmental Cost of Staying Fashionable\u201d, United Nations, March 19, 2019, https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035161.\n8 \"Putting the brakes on fast fashion\", UNEP, November 12, 2018, https://www.u nep.org/news-and-stories/story/putting-brakes-fast-fashion. \n9 This certification includes ZDHC (zero discharge hazardous chemicals), RSL compliance , GOTS 6.0 Additives approval, and positive list verified by \nEcocert\ufffd  Kornit achieved Bluesign System Partner status in 2022\ufffd\n10 Calculations based on our LCA performed to the Presto S and published in our 2020 report\ufffd Assumptions: water amount for shower - 25 gallons, \nwater amount for cup of water - 0\ufffd06340129 gallons\ufffdIn contrast to screen printing, our digital printing process:\n \u25a0Conserves water \nby not requiring manual \nwashing of components \nbetween steps\ufffd  \u25a0Is free of                         \npre-treatments, \nsteaming, and \nwashing,  so our \ncustomers consume less \nwater, waste less water, \nand are therefore more \nsustainable\ufffd \u25a0Uses Kornit's \nproprietary ink \nthat meets the strictest \nstandards of quality and \nsafety: Bluesign, ECO \nPASSPORT by OEK-TEX, and \nGOTS certified9\ufffd\n24an average of\n619,688 55,771,899L 224M\nshowers cups of water10of water\ncan potentially be saved annually using the Kornit Presto MAX*   \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KRNT_2021.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
