{"page_content": "PROTECTING  THE  PLANET\nOur investment in improving the sustainability of our own operations is as important as enabling a more sustainable \nproduction process. Our sustainability initiatives include climate action and increasing energy efficiency, reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and implementing green chemistry principles\ufffd\nCLIMATE ACTION & ENERGY EFFICIENCY \nWe are already witnessing the devastating effects of climate change, from wildfires and droughts to floods and storms. \nThese events are expected to grow more frequent and more severe as global temperatures rise17\ufffd To reduce the effects \nof climate change, we believe we must do all we can to minimize GHG emissions across our business operations\ufffd\ufffd\nAt Kornit, we strive to reduce our own carbon footprint and set an example in the industry\ufffd Our focus areas include \nreducing energy consumption, increasing our share of renewable energy, reducing the amounts of VOC in our ink \nproducts, and generally improving our operational efficiency. We are also in the process of calculating our full Scope \n3 emissions (indirect emissions throughout our value chain), which include, among other components, emissions \nresulting from the manufacturing of our printing systems by third-party OEMs\ufffd\nIn addition to our measures to reduce our carbon footprint by eliminating emissions at the source, we also take measures \nto offset emissions via reforestation projects\ufffd In this way, we are counterbalancing a portion of the emissions resulting \nfrom our operations while contributing to a vital project that increases the quality of life in urban and suburban areas \nIn 2021, we planted 2,623 trees through the following projects: BE THE CHANGE\nCollaboration with the Climate Forest\nWe partnered with the Climate Forest, an Israeli initiative which \ncarries out sustainable tree planting in urban environments\ufffd \nThe trees planted by the Climate Forest with our funds yielded \nan offset of 200 MTCO2-e\ufffdCollaboration with Ecologi\nWe worked with Ecologi to plant trees in multiple \nprojects in Mozambique, Madagascar, and \nNicaragua\ufffd\nWe also partnered with Ecologi to offset 48 MTCO2-e \nin two different projects - protecting lowland peat \nforest in Indonesia and a small-scale onshore wind \npower project18\ufffd\nKORNIT  \nFOREST\nMazi Levi, VP of Chemistry, Kornit DigitalWe\u2019re on track to dramatically cut emissions in our products and \nprinting processes.\n17 IPCC, 2022: Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability\ufffd\n18 https://ecologi\ufffdcom/kornit\ufffd\n32", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KRNT_2021.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
