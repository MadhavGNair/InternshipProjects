{"page_content": "42Annual United Way Campaign at Paychex\nAfter a year-long hiatus in FY2021 due to COVID-19, where we encouraged employees to keep their 2020 \npledge in place until the next campaign, we returned to our traditional campaign model \u2013 with a twist \u2013 in \nMay of 2022. With fewer office locations post-pandemic and more employees working remotely or in a hybrid \nschedule, it gave us the opportunity to engage employees in a one-hour, nationwide virtual kickoff. The \ntelethon-like event featured Paychex employees helped by United Way, company leaders, and community \nrepresentatives who made the case for giving. It was the second-most attended virtual event in Paychex \nhistory, generated tremendous excitement, and brought in more than $100K during the event alone.*Combined employee donations from two FY21 rollovers while traditional campaign paused due to the pandemic.2017$0$200k$400k$600k$800k$1m\n2018 2019 2020 2021*2022\nEmployee Contributions to United Way$730,038 $746,910$842,003$894,973\n$595,429$770,591\n$2,389,200 Corporate Contributions \nto United Way 2017-2022: \n$14 millionSince 2006, Paychex and its employees have given \nto United Way organizations across the U.S., keeping their \nsupport alive and well regardless of the circumstances.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_PAYX_2022.pdf", "page": 43, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
