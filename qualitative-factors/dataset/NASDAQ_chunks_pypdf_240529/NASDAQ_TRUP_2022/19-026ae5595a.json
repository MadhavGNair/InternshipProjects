Through strategic partnerships with well-aligned industry players and \nadditional products, we\u2019re working on growing access to ensure every pet parent can get the care they need.\u00a0\nIn 2021, we developed Furkin and PHI Direct, our low and medium priced\u00a0products. These brands\u00a0offer pet parents transparent, easy-to-understand \nplans with fewer benefits at a lower cost.\u00a0\u00a0\nBy the end of 2025, our goal is to reach millions\u00a0of\u00a0pets through new products, channels, and geographies. At the end of the day, more protected pets \nmeans improved access to care for pet parents, better health outcomes for pets, and a more sustainable veterinary care ecosystem. That\u2019s a win-win-win.\nINTRODUCTION                            CHANGING THE PET HEALTH PARADIGM                            SUPPORTING OUR TEAMS                            UNDERSTANDING OUR FOOTPRINT                            GOVERNANCE   \n \nAs of December 31, 2022", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TRUP_2022.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
