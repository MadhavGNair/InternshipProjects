The results show our \ncompensation on the high end of the industry \nstandard and also show us areas where we can \nimprove. We also perform risk assessments for all \nperformance-based associate compensation plans for \nthe Human Resources and Compensation Committee.  \nIn addition, we commission an independent analysis \nof our salaries to identify and address any disparities \nwith regard to gender and racial diversity. For 2023, associates received an average pay increase \nof 6%, up from a typical average of 4% to adjust for \ninflation and right-size compensation for internal \nequity.  \nContinue our practice of conducting a compensation \nstudy annually to ensure both competitive and fair \npay. In 2023, we will dive deeper to look at equity, job \ndescriptions, titles and more for fair compensation.\nFull-time, part-time and non-regular employment\nNearly all of our associates are employed full time by \nthe firm, which we believe helps drive fairness and \na better client experience.
