{"page_content": "16 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\nDeputy Chief Credit Risk Officer Lance \nZaremba joined Amalgamated Bank in \n2015 with over 20 years of commercial \nlending experience. With a background in \nunderwriting and portfolio management, \nLance observed that \u201cAmalgamated Bank \nwas searching for a greater purpose.\u201d The \nBank responded by sharpening its focus on \nacquiring and developing talent. According \nto Lance, \u201cThis process gave us ready-to-go \nexpertise in mission-aligned lending that \nreally took off once we de-emphasized our \nlegacy-loan portfolio.\u201d \nLance is frank when it comes to mission: \n\u201cI\u2019m a credit and numbers guy. At the \noutset my goal was to get our leveraged \nand indirect portfolio down \u2014 from $600 \nmillion to about $50 million now \u2014 and \npush bankers to source high-quality loans \nfrom direct lending relationships.\u201d Acquiring expertise from key hires in the solar industry \nand community development financial \ninstitutions gave the bank the edge it \nneeded to hit the target Lance envisioned. \n\u201cIdeally you want relationship managers to \nbe experts at lending into a sector. That is \nthe perfect situation, and it is hard to do. \nToday, Amalgamated Bank not only has the \nexpertise, but also the ladders that turn new \nbankers into experts. That\u2019s our defensible \neconomic moat and it\u2019s how we empower \norganizations and individuals to advance \npositive change.\u201d\n \nBeing past the learning curve also means \nAmalgamated Bank is a known entity and \ntrusted partner. \u201cClients know we can \ndeliver. Our track record plus our in-house \nexpertise plus our knowledge of policy \nin the solar lending space means we are \ntrusted to deliver on deals,\u201d Lance said. \u201cThat\u2019s a radical departure from where we \nwere just seven years ago and is completely \nderived from our focus on our purpose to be \nAmerica\u2019s socially responsible bank.\u201d \nAt this point, the bank\u2019s mission and its \nnumbers have fully combined in Lance\u2019s \nmind. \u201cAmalgamated Bank found its stride \nover the last few years by focusing on \nits mission, and we wouldn\u2019t be looking \nat the same growth trajectory without \nthat greater purpose. At the same time, \nour deep understanding of the specific \ndrivers of credit risk coupled with industry \nexpertise means we underwrite smart loans. \nFocusing on fundamentals means we can \nbe a trusted partner in the clean-energy \nfinance revolution that\u2019s underway and \nsorely needed to stem the worst outcomes \nof global climate change.\u201d \u201c Amalgamated Bank found its stride over the last few years by focusing  \non its mission, and we wouldn\u2019t be looking at the same growth trajectory \nwithout that purpose.\u201d OUR PEOPLE, OUR IMPACT\nLANCE ZAREMBA\nDeputy Chief Credit Risk Officer", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2021.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
