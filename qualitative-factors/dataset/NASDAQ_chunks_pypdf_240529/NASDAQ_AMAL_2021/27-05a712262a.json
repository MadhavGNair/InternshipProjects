{"page_content": "28 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\nNow in our third year of financed emissions disclosures, Amalgamated Bank\u2019s investment into the PCAF standard for measuring \nand disclosing emissions has had a significant impact on not only our progress on sustainability, but also on the industry around us.\n\u2022  PCAF is now used by more than 280 financial institutions with more than $76 trillion in assets.\n\u2022  PCAF is recommended by the Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures and the proposed sustainability disclosures from the \nInternational Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).\n\u2022  PCAF is widely accepted as the standard for disclosing absolute financed emissions as required by the UN-convened Net Zero \nBanking Alliance.\nOur work with PCAF has also played a central role in our climate target setting. We used our 2020 emissions disclosure and analysis as the \nbaseline for the Net Zero Targets Report we published in October 2021. Amalgamated was the first U.S. bank to commit to the Science Based \nTargets initiative (SBTi), and the first to have targets validated.\n28 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\n2021 DISCLOSURE\nThis year we report total Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions of our clients as 28,391 tons of CO2e. This is down slightly from 47,410 in \n2020. Our avoided emissions increased significantly from 107,395 in 2020 to 172,345 tons in 2021. This reflects the growth in our climate \nsolutions portfolio from 23% of total portfolio to 32%. \nOur avoided emissions are now more than three times greater than our total absolute financed emissions. Accordingly, our total portfolio \nemissions intensity has dropped to an industry-leading 8.3 tCO2e/M$ for client Scope 1 and 2, and 4.4 TCO2e/M$ for client Scope 3.\n ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2021.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
