This was done with Invesco, one of the largest ESG \ninvestment firms in the world. \nThe importance of social, climate, and gender equity in building a more just, sustainable, \nand inclusive future has never been clearer, and these six new funds provide a unique \nalternative to those already on the market.\nResponsiFunds utilizes a variety of tools to not just filter out misaligned companies, \nbut to also screen those companies that are ESG leaders. They also undergo additional \nscreening by using ESG data from leading data providers like CDP, Equileap, JUST \nCapital, Sustainalytics, and others. These proprietary screening methods seek to exclude \nindustries such as pipelines, weapons, coal, tobacco, the Carbon Underground 200, \nand others, while also screening in companies that are going above and beyond in their \nrespective ESG arenas.\n69 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2021.pdf", "page": 68, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
