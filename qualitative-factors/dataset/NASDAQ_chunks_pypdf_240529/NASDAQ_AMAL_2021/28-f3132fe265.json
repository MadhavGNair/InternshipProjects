This is a reduction from 2020, primarily due to portions of the securities and PACE \nportfolio having insufficient data to calculate an avoided emissions estimate. \n \nCONSISTENCY  \nOur 2021 inventories use the same methodology and operational boundaries as 2019 and 2020, but with advances in the quality of data it \nmay not always be possible to make full comparisons.\n \nRELEVANCE   \nOur 2021 inventories appropriately reflect the GHG emissions of our company and serve to inform decision-making for our internal \nclimate strategy and for our stakeholders.\n \nACCURACY   \nOur 2021 inventories follow the PCAF Global methodology.
