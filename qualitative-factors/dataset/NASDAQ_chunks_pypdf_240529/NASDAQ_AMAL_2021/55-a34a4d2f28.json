{"page_content": "56 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\n \nThe Amalgamated Foundation is truly an incubator for innovation.\nWhen we launched the Foundation in 2017, we wanted to be more than just a funding intermediary. We \nwanted to be a force for change. That meant not just moving resources to front-line organizations. We \nwanted to push the philanthropic sector to rethink its systems and structure. You can\u2019t make social change \nif you aren\u2019t willing to change yourself.\nThat\u2019s why we created the Hate is Not Charitable Campaign, to elevate the dialogue about the funding of \nhate and the responsibility of philanthropic institutions to take a stand. To date, over 100 institutions have \nsigned onto our pledge to defund hate, representing more than $3 billion in assets.\nIn 2020, we released a report, \u201cCommunity-Led Disaster Relief\u201d, which highlighted the failings \u2014 and \nopportunities for transformation of disaster relief funding. In 2021, we applied those ideas to launch \n\u201cOrganizing Resilience\u201d changing the way disaster response happens. This project activated networks and \ninfrastructure to support community-led responses to Hurricane Ida, first in New Orleans, and also for \nstorms in New Jersey and New York, leveraging over $500,000 in aid to directly hit communities. \nI\u2019m very proud that we distributed over $100 million in grants to more than 2,000 organizations in 2021. Our \ncommitment to democracy, sustainability, and workers\u2019 rights has never been stronger.\nAnna Fink  \nExecutive Director, Amalgamated Foundation\u201cYou can\u2019t make social change if you \naren\u2019t willing to change yourself.\u201d\n56 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2021.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
