The foundation of our work is \na commitment to measure our impact, to set targets that guide our business and the impact we have in the world, and to be transparent about what this will mean. Many companies and countries have committed to a 1.5-degree temperature outcome that will provide a safe and stable climate. As society has already walked up to that line and is perilously slow to exceeding safe emissions levels, it is more important than ever that climate commitments are supported by hard science and real plans.\nTCFD recommendation Disclosure Link/Source Additional information\nDisclosure of the metrics and \ntargets used to assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunitiesa)\n Dis\nclose the metrics used by the\norganization to assess climate-relatedrisks and opportunities in line with itsstrategy and risk management process.Net Zero Climate Targets Report Metrics and current science-based targets are  found in our Net Zero Climate Targets Report.
