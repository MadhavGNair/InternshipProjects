{"page_content": "70 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\nOUR PEOPLE, OUR IMPACT\nCYNTHIA DALAGELIS\nSVP, Director of ESG Investments\nSenior Vice President and Director of \nESG Investments Cynthia Dalagelis \nalways knew she wanted to do \nsomething that would benefit people \nand the environment. While she was a \nbusiness student, her options to work in \nsustainability were limited to philanthropy \nand volunteering. Only a handful of \ncompanies, including Amalgamated Bank, \nwere pursuing ESG and corporate social \nresponsibility in the private sector at the \ntime. Cynthia sought them out and began \nher career as an impact professional \nworking to drive mission alignment in \nbusinesses. \u201cI always knew there were \nopportunities in the private sector, but I \nalso knew that a lot needed to change in \npublic equity and debt markets to make \nthese companies thrive and really have  \nan impact\u201d she said.That\u2019s where active ownership comes in, \nCynthia says. By helping clients align their \ncapital with their values, Cynthia helps \nthem drive change by moving capital. \n\u201cValues-based investments are a vote of \nconfidence in the world we want to live \nin and leave to our children. When clients \nchoose to divest from some companies \nand invest in others because of their \nvalues, they are saying, \u2018We want a better \nworld, we want to have a bigger impact, \nand we don\u2019t want our money to enable \nindustry to undermine the values we fight \nfor day to day.\u2019 ESG investing is a clear \ninvestment trend now with more and more \nindividuals and organizations looking for \nexpertise to help make financial decisions \nthat put their money behind positive \nimpact while generating a return. Over the long term, the biggest outcome \nand main benefit of the movement \nfor ESG investing is greater corporate \ntransparency. \u201cGreater transparency \nin corporate spaces allows investors, \nconsumers, and employees to make \nmore informed decisions. Right now, we \ngenerally don\u2019t have full transparency \nas far as gender metrics, for example. \nWe don\u2019t know the composition of \nstaff as far as gender and don\u2019t know \npay-gap statistics. Disclosing metrics \nlike this would improve workplaces \nand productivity. That\u2019s one reason \ngender issues are a key plank in our ESG \nphilosophy, which is fundamentally a call \nfor transparency.\u201d \u201c Values-based investments are a vote of confidence in the world we  \nwant to live in and leave to our children.\u201d ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2021.pdf", "page": 69, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
