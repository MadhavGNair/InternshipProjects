{"page_content": "23 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\nIn 2021, we continued our tradition of environmental leadership by being at \nthe forefront of climate action for the banking community. We continued to \ndrive progress in quantifying the climate impact of our financing, managing our \noperational emissions, and setting strategy to accelerate the change to a climate-\nsafe future. We are proud to share some of the key highlights from this year: \nWe became the first U.S. \nbank to set a net zero \nclimate target and to have \nthose targets approved by \nthe Science Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi).\nWe achieved net zero \noperations through our \nstrategic purchase of \nrenewable energy and \ncarbon offsets for the fifth \nyear in a row. We continued to expand \nour solar project lending \nportfolio and PACE financing \nprograms, enhancing the \nclimate benefits of our \nlending practices. \nWe published our second \nPartnership for Carbon \nAccounting Financials \n(PCAF) disclosure with \nenhanced asset class details. OUR CLIENTS IN ACTION\nSolar Holler was founded with \nthe mission to make clean energy \naffordable, to rebuild the Appalachian \neconomy, and to spread the benefits \nof clean energy to those who need it \nmost. By providing innovative financing \nsolutions for solar projects, as well \nas solar training programs, a union \nworkforce, and apprenticeships, \nSolar Holler is paving the way for \neconomic justice for both the people of \nAppalachia and the environment.\n\u201cMission alignment was important,\u201d \nsaid Jessica Edgerly Walsh, Director of \nMarketing, \u201cbut because solar is so small \nin central Appalachia, local banks don\u2019t \nreally understand our business. Working \nwith Amalgamated has been great \nbecause solar is what you all know. Our \nline of credit with Amalgamated is scaled \nproperly to our business and recognizes \nthe queue of projects contracted and \nawaiting installation. Up until now, we\u2019d \nbeen working with smaller lines of credit, \nand we were making it work. But now, \nwith a bit more credit, we can make \nsmarter decisions and negotiate better \nbulk purchase deals.\u201d\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2021.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
