The Bank defines \nbeing an anti-racism organization as creating an environment where all employees, \nregardless of race or the color of their skin, know they are valued. We acknowledge \nthat racism can be unconscious or unintentional and identifying racism as an issue does \nnot automatically mean those involved in the act are racist or intended the negative \nimpact of their words or actions. As an anti-racism organization, we constantly strive to \nidentify, discuss, and challenge issues of race and color and the impacts they have on \nthe Bank, our work, our employees, and our clients. The Bank will not tolerate racism in \nthe workplace, including microaggressions. \nPart of our commitment is acknowledging that, although we have always strived to \ncreate a fair and open workplace, there is more that we can do.

We provide support, partnership, and education for \nemployees as they transition their gender, and for gender nonconforming and transgender \nemployees.
