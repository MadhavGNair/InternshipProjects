This index is the national \nbenchmarking tool on corporate \npolicies, practices, and benefits \npertinent to lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and queer employees.\nEQUAL OPPORTUNITY \nPay Equity \nAmalgamated Bank completed a pay-equity audit in 2020 based on the factors of race \nand gender. The study found the vast majority of employees experience pay parity at \nAmalgamated and, as a result, a very small number of minor adjustments were made \nto compensation packages. In part, we credit a collectively bargained agreement with \nour unionized employees for the significant pay parity at the Bank. Amalgamated is \ncommitted to pay parity across the company and intends to conduct a pay-equity audit \nevery three years.\nEEO1 Form Disclosure \nPlease follow the link to the 2021 EEO1 form.* This workforce diversity data showcases the \nBank\u2019s continued commitment to building a diverse and vibrant workforce that reflects \nthe communities in which we serve.
