This was not your \ntypical sports sponsorship but a collective \naction to use both organizations\u2019 voices \nand resources to advance racial justice, \nvoting rights, and gender justice, while \nlifting up the work of movement leaders \nacross the country.\nAs part of the collaboration, WNBA stars \nSue Bird, Natasha Cloud, and Elizabeth \nWilliams appeared in a series of videos \nthat highlighted their own personal connections to social justice issues. The \nvideos aim to demonstrate how both \norganizations have joined to build a \nmore socially responsible world. As part \nof this partnership, the Amalgamated \nFoundation established the WNBPA Social \nImpact Fund, which grants donations to \norganizations actively working to fight \nfor change. These include Black Voters \nMatter, Sister Song, the New Georgia \nProject, Transgender Legal Defense \nand Education Fund, G.L.I.T.S., and the \nNational Council of Negro Women. \nThis represents the first time that \nAmalgamated Bank has aligned with \na sports organization and professional \nathletes to advance economic, social, \nracial, and environmental justice utilizing \nthe tools of finance. \n\u201c Amalgamated and the WNBPA share a deep alignment.
