Specifically, these \nemissions categories are:\n\u2022 Financed Emissions\n\u2022  Commercial Real Estate\n\u2022  Multifamily Housing\n\u2022  Mortgages\n\u2022  Business Loans (i.e., project financing)\nTo set science-based targets, companies \nare required to select a baseline year for \nemissions reductions. We set our baseline \nemissions for 2020, as this was the latest \nPCAF data we had available at the time \nthe targets were set.\nFor each of our emissions categories, \nwe modeled relevant decarbonization \nstrategies and policies to build a pathway \nmodel for net zero emissions. These \nmethods and assumptions follow the \nguidance established by the Science \nBased Targets initiative and the UN \nCollective Commitment on Climate  \nAction as adopted by the UN-convened \nNet Zero Banking Alliance.The chart above details the results of our modeling. Note that there are multiple pathways \nincluded in our analysis. The top line, titled \u201cAbsolute Emissions Trajectory\u201d, is an analysis of the \naverage annual decline across our emissions categories needed to reach a 2050 net zero ambition. \n\u201cAbsolute Emissions Trajectory with State Policy\u201d is an analysis inclusive of state regulations \nmaterial to our portfolio that have a high degree of certainty to drive further decarbonization for \nour emissions categories. Starting in 2030, we have also modeled \u201cemissions removals\u201d as a third \npathway in our analysis. The final line, titled \u201cNet Emissions\u201d, is the resulting average decline based \non the \u201cAbsolute Emissions Trajectory with State Policy\u201d and the \u201cEmissions Removals\u201d pathways. \nThis line is the pathway guiding our overall climate ambition and targets.ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS\n60,000\n50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n-10,0000\n2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 20452 05030,403\n24,046Absolute Emissions (tonne CO 2\nYear49% reduction in 2030\nNet Zero in 204 5Absolute Emissions \nTrajectory\nAbsolute Emissions Trajectory \nwith State Policy\nEmissions Removals\nNet Emissions Absolute Emissions Reduction \nTargets with State PolicyAbsolute Emissions Reduction \nTargets)\nA link to our Net Zero Report can be found here.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2021.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
