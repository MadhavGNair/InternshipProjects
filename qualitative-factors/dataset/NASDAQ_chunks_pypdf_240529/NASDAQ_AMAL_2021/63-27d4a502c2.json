{"page_content": "64 2021 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\nOUR PEOPLE, OUR IMPACT\nBRENDA LOYA\nFVP, National Director of Community Development Finance\nBrenda Loya chose to study computer \nscience and electrical engineering at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology \nbecause it was the hardest degree track \navailable. \u201cIt was also the \u201890s and the \nmoment of going into tech and becoming \na software engineer,\u201d she explained. \u201cMIT\u2019s \nprogram was focused on understanding \nengineering systematically. We learned to look \nat problems analytically and break them down \nto make something better. That is a mindset \nI\u2019ve carried with me throughout my life.\u201d As a \nNational Director of Community Development \nFinance, Brenda sees herself as someone who \nis constantly challenging herself and sees \nAmalgamated Bank at a similar moment to \nwhere she was as an engineering student in \nthe late 1990s. \n\u201cThe world is at a critical moment. In \nthe United States, we\u2019re living through a \nreckoning with racist discrimination that left communities of color without adequate \ninvestment for equitable economic growth. \nAt the same time, global climate change is \nexacerbating the worst of these inequalities, \nfurther marginalizing communities that have \nhistorically been denied access to the capital \nthey urgently need for investment in climate \nsolutions that work for everyone.\u201d \nBrenda spent three years building \nAmalgamated Bank\u2019s platform for lending to \ncommunity development financial institutions \n(CDFI\u2019s) to meet the moment made by the \nintersection of movements for racial justice \nand urgent calls for investment in climate \nsolutions. She came to Amalgamated Bank \nwith more than a decade of experience in the \ncommunity development finance sector after \nstudying business at Georgetown University \nand learning how to drive social impact in the \nfield. After leading investments into projects \nin low- to moderate-income areas and building organizational capacity for growth, she tripled \nAmalgamated Bank\u2019s CDFI portfolio. \nBrenda believes that Amalgamated Bank is a \ncritical player and influential voice as these \nissues come together as environmental justice. \nFor example, that means providing funding \nand structure for affordable housing and asset-\nbuilding initiatives that protect communities \nfrom further environmental damage and racial \ninjustices. \n\u201cThis work takes me back to where I\u2019m from, \nthe working-class border communities that \nshaped who I am as a Latina and showed me \nthat I am not doing any of this work alone. I \nhave a community, a team, and partnerships \nin the CDFI sector that work together for \neveryday changes that lead to big impacts.\u201d  \u201c I have a community, a team, and partnerships in the CDFI sector that work \ntogether for everyday changes that lead to big impacts.\u201d \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2021.pdf", "page": 63, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
