With this in mind,  \na perfect addition to enhance their design \nworkflow was Altair\u00ae OptiStruct\u00ae.\nThe structural design specialists at SOM used \nOptiStruct to generate an ideal project plan that considered sustainable regulations and manufacturing constraints. With this unique design, SOM was able to minimize the weightof the building and use fewer materials, reducing cost for both the client and contractor. Specifically, the SOM team reduced the steel needed by 10 percent while improving the global \nperformance of the structural system.\nThe building received LEED\u00ae Platinum certification \nand reached the GSA\u2019s 2020 energy objective. It has also won more than 35 awards for its creative \nand timeless design.\nRead the full customer story here .\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALTR_2020.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
