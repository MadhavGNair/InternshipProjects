{"page_content": "Practices Overview People Products Planet\nOverview:\nAltair Sustainability Report  /  9\nSHARED INFRASTRUCTURE\nWe offer cloud-based applications which allow \nefficiently scaled and shared infrastructure to be used by multiple organizations, thus eliminating countless independent compute server installations and giving access to a broad range of applications \nrelevant to sustainable design.\nSUSTAINABLE DESIGN\nWe enable structural optimization to inspire and refine product designs that minimize material \nusage and maximize performance. Customers \ncan utilize simulation-driven innovation to rapidly develop products, processes, and experiences \nin a virtual world without the carbon and waste \nstream impact of multiple physical prototypes.OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY\nWe empower our HPC customers\u2019 workload management to ensure efficiency of energy \nusage and run time. Altair supports additive \nmanufacturing and other advanced manufacturing techniques to embody the most optimal designs \ndeveloped from simulation methodologies at the \nlowest cost.\nMATERIAL EFFICIENCY\nEngineered plastics and laminate composites offer the design freedom to meet lightweighting \nand cost requirements for complex parts. \nHigh-quality plastic materials can be produced quickly and at high volume, but holistic simulation is needed to tailor materials to the individual product requirements. Altair offers a comprehensive set of engineering plastic \nsolutions to produce innovative plastic parts \nquickly and reliably.\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) isn\u2019t just for rapid \nprototyping, research projects, and advanced engineering teams. It is now a viable production \nsolution, and Altair provides a robust simulation \ntool chain to support production designs created specifically for AM.\nOur Vision and Sustainability Impact", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALTR_2020.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
