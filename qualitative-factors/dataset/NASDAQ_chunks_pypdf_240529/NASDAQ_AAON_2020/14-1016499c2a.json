Our seven member Board of Directors includes our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 5 independent directors. The Board of Directors provides advice, insight and oversight to advance the interests of AAON, our shareholders and other  \nstakeholders. AAON strives to maintain governance standards through governance charters and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nIn May 2020, Norman H. Asbjornson, founder of AAON, stepped down \nas CEO after leading the Company since its creation 32 years ago. Mr.  \nAsbjornson transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman, while Gary Fields, President of the Company since 2016, took over as CEO and  President. The change at the top of the organization marked the end of a succession plan that began several years ago. Along with a transition at the top, the company undertook many other changes in leadership and structure. Although this change did come with some growing pains in 2018-2019, we are confident the Company is back on track as reflected in our 2020 results. This change will lead to many long-term positive  \noutcomes. We strongly believe our new team-oriented leadership  \nstructure, along with improved internal processes, will best position the Company to continue to build on its impressive foundation while fostering sustainable, long-term success.
