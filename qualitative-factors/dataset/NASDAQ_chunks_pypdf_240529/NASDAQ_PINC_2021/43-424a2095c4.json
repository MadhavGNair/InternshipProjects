For example, \nsome members are pursuing the elimination of chemicals of \nconcern from certain product categories in accordance with \nindustry guidelines established by Practice Greenhealth and  \nthe Healthcare Anchor Network (HAN). Combining member \npurchasing data within our GPO supply chain with our EPP \nsupplier information allows our members to track and monitor \ncompliance with their sustainability targets. \nUnderstanding that the enormous challenge of improving \nhealthcare\u2019s environmental footprint can only be solved by \nclose cooperation, we foster ties with all \nconcerned parties. We have a long history \nwith Practice Greenhealth and continue to \nsupport their efforts. We have also collabo -\nrated closely with HAN, providing feedback on how GPOs can support HAN\u2019s dual objectives of supporting \nlocal economies and furthering environmental justice.\nTransportation and Logistics\nWe provide our GPO members with direct sourcing options \nthrough our subsidiary, S2S, primarily for commodities, as \ndiscussed in Global Direct Sourcing section above. Most  \nof these direct-sourced items are produced by suppliers in \nSoutheast Asia.\nWe rely on third-party transportation providers who use fuel \nand energy on our behalf to transport our directly sourced \ngoods via various modes of transportation, including air, ocean \nand road. We take a holistic approach to our energy manage -\nment to seek to optimize delivery efficiencies within the value \nchain we support between our members and suppliers. \nOur Holistic Approach\nWe exercise a process of continual feedback and process refinement to seek to optimize practices that minimize the time, \ncost and environmental impact of our order fulfillment operations, as highlighted below: \n1\nGoods from Southeast Asia \nare typically shipped to us \nthrough container ship \nvessels,  which we believe \ncreate a smaller carbon \nfootprint when supporting \nour international transporta -\ntion needs as compared to \nairborne delivery options. 2\nOnce these containers arrive at a \nU.S. port, they are delivered by \nthird-party diesel trucks to one of \nour two leased distribution \ncenters,  strategically located at \neach coast (Charlotte, North \nCarolina, and Riverside, California), \nto best minimize distance require -\nments and carbon footprints of that \ndelivery transportation. 3\nOnce at the distribution \ncenter, the products are \noffloaded and housed \nwithin the warehouse  \nuntil ordered by a \ncustomer, using electric \nforklifts and automated \ntechnology features.4\nFor the final direct-to-customer delivery, \nwe again utilize third-party diesel trucks. \nOnce ordered, products reach the customer \nthrough parcel mode for small items, and \neither full- or limited-truckloads for larger \nitems. We continually review and manage \nthis final order fulfillment stage to utilize \nfull-truckloads whenever possible to best \nmaximize delivery efficiency and minimize \nthe carbon footprint. \nCEO Letter Making a \nPremier ImpactAwards  and  \nAssociationsAbout This \nReportGovernance People and \nCultureSocial \nResponsibilitySupply Chain \nManagementEnvironmental \nManagementFrameworks \nand StandardsTable of Contents\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_PINC_2021.pdf", "page": 43, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
