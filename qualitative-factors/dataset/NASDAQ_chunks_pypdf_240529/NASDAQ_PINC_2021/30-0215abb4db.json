This effort unites a \ncohort of more than 200 diverse hospitals from every state and \nthe District of Columbia, largely caring for the underserved to \nimplement and scale standardized, evidence-based practices \nto identify and reduce factors that are proven to contribute to \nadverse outcomes.Improving Patient Outcomes Cost-effectively\nPremier plays a critical role in the rapidly evolving healthcare \nindustry by collaborating with members to co-develop long-\nterm innovations that reinvent and improve the way care is \ndelivered to patients nationwide.
