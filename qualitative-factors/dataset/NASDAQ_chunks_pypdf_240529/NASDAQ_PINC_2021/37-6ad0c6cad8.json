These \nproducts are typically offered to our members through our \nGPO. We believe that our direct sourcing activities help  \nour members and other customers access a diverse product \nportfolio and help provide transparency to manufacturing  \ncosts and competitive pricing. We market our direct sourcing \nactivities primarily under the PREMIERPRO\u00ae brand.\nGiven the global footprint of our contract manufacturing \nsuppliers, our corporate social responsibility practices at S2S \nare paramount. S2S has adopted strong anti-bribery standards, \nand seeks to identify and prevent the occurrence of forced \nlabor and human trafficking in our supply chain through: \nAnnual social responsibility audits of our contracted manu -\nfacturers conducted by an international third-party auditor.  \nAudits are both announced and unannounced and include \nprivate worker interviews and inspections of manufacturing and \nliving facilities. All findings are reported at the end of each \naudit. Manufacturers that repeatedly fail to meet our standards \nas set forth in a corrective action plan are terminated.Annual instructor-led anti-bribery and human trafficking \neducation  for all our S2S employees with webinar sessions for \nS2S sourcing agents and other personnel who work with S2S, \nincluding our Anti-Bribery and Human Trafficking Policies and \nProcedures as provided in the Compliance and Ethics section \nof our corporate website.
