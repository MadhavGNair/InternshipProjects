{"page_content": "Empowering Digital T ransformation\nOur Approach\nQualcomm is an invention company that solves fundamental technology problems at the heart of everyday life.  \nThe vast majority of cell phones on earth utilize our technology. Our inventions have helped power the growth in \nsmartphones, which have connected billions of people. We make our connected world \u2014 and future \u2014 possible by  \npushing the boundaries of connectivity, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and more. \nWe are a global leader in the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry. \nOur technologies and products are used in mobile devices and other wireless products and are sold across industries and \napplications from mobile handsets to automotive to Io T and beyond.\nWe share our inventions broadly through our \nlicensing program \u2014 enabling wide ecosystem access \nto technologies at the core of mobile innovation \u2014 \nand through the sale of our wireless integrated circuit \nplatforms and other products. \nWe believe in good faith license negotiations and \nfair value for our patented technology. We believe \nthis approach to licensing creates efficiency in the \necosystem and reflects the value and innovation that \nour research, developments and contributions provide.\nWe collaborate across the ecosystem, which \nincludes manufacturers, operators, developers, system \nintegrators, cloud providers, tool vendors, service \nproviders, governments and industry standards \norganizations, to enable a global environment to drive \ncontinued progress and growth. We inspire the development of regionally relevant \nuse cases of advanced 4G and 5G connectivity, AI at \nthe network edge and Io T through deep-technology \nincubators and mentorship programs for early-stage \nstartups in many emerging markets, including India, \nT aiwan and Vietnam. \nWe invest heavily in R&D, have a long history of \ndriving innovation and have developed foundational \ntechnologies that help drive the continued evolution \nof the wireless industry.\nWe bring advanced wireless technologies \nto people and communities who need it most, \nfacilitating new business models and unlocking \nsocietal benefits that serve the greater good.The technology development at the foundation \nof our solutions is governed by our T echnical \nBusiness Review (TBR) process with oversight by \nour Chief T echnology Officer (CTO). The goal of \nthe TBR process is to align long-term technology \ndevelopment with product (application-specific \nintegrated circuit (ASIC) and software) roadmaps. \nThe output of the TBR results in guidance for \nthe development of industry-leading technology \nroadmaps across all our business units and the \nR&D spend needed for key technology areas. \nThese technology areas feed into Qualcomm\u2019s \none technology roadmap and span processing, \nconnectivity, visual technologies, rendering \ntechnologies, AI, security and system-level \ntechnologies needed for various business units \n(e.g., mobile, compute, automotive, connected \nsystems and networking).\nGoals:\nReduce power consumption \nby 10% , every year8, in our flagship \nSnapdragon\u00ae Mobile Platform products.\nEnrich the lives of 27 million \npeople  by continuing to bring technology \nto underserved communities around the \nworld through Qualcomm\u00ae Wireless Reach\u2122 \nby 2025, from a 2006 base year9.\nContinue to foster next generation of \ninnovators by inspiring 1.5 million \nstudents and teachers  across the \nglobe through our STEM initiatives by 2025, \nfrom a 2020 base year.\n8 Given equivalent features\n9 Defined as direct and indirect beneficiaries. \n13\n2022 Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report\nEmpowering Digital T ransformation", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_QCOM_2022.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
