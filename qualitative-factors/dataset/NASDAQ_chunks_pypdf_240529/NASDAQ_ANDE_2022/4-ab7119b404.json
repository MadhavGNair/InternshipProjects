{"page_content": "5\nSix months ago, The Andersons published initial environmental metrics on our \nScope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions to complement our ongoing Social and \nGovernance. The 2022 Sustainability Review brings together Environmental, Social, \nand Governance stories and metrics. This Review lays the foundation for future \nES&G reporting. Our desire is to be proactive and nimble, both for our stakeholders \nand as new reporting requirements are promulgated. \nSince November, many of our customers have encouraged our progress, and I hope \nthat we continue to impress them with our transparency and ES&G stewardship. \nBecause the work published in November showcased our 2020 GHG impact, we \ncan now provide data in this report in the form of a trend. In the report, you will \nnote energy use, emissions data trends, and disclosure of the work we are doing to \nreport water use and waste generation. We also are able to expand on our efforts \nthat are going into our sustainable sourcing partnerships and projects.\nTimothy Venverloh\nDirector, Environmental, Social, and Governance\nThe AndersonsA LETTER FROM ES&G DIRECTOR TIMOTHY VENVERLOH\nINTRODUCTION\nENVIRONMENTAL\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\nGRI INDEX", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2022.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
