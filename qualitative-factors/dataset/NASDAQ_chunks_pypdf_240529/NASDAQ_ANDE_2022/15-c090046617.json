{"page_content": "16\nBUILDING STRONG COMMUNITIES\nService is a cornerstone of The Andersons. We \nfirmly believe in the importance of generously \npursuing worthwhile opportunities that benefit \nthe communities in which we work and live, \nincluding several key areas:\n\u2022 Agriculture and Environment\n\u2022 Social Services\n\u2022 Civic and Community\n\u2022 Education\n\u2022 Arts and Culture\n\u2022 Health and Wellness\nSince 1947, we have contributed a portion of \nour operating income each year to community \norganizations. Millions of dollars have been \ndistributed in more than 100 communities in over \n20 states. These funds come from our company \nand the corporate foundation, as well as from \nother related foundations and funds.\nAnother important aspect of our service to \nothers is our annual workplace giving campaign, \nencouraging each employee to contribute to \nthe charities that they choose, in their local \ncommunities and across the nation. Each year, \nabout half of our employees contribute to more \nthan 500 different charities. The Andersons pays all costs to administer the campaign, so 100% of \neach employee\u2019s contribution goes directly to the \ncharities.\nAn added benefit is the gift match program. We \nmatch, dollar for dollar and up to $1,000 per \ncalendar year, contributions employees have made \nto charitable organizations. The company matches \nalmost $100,000 through this program annually.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE AND SAFETY\nThe Andersons provides direct financial \nsupport to emergency response organizations for equipment investments, including AED \ndefibrillators, fire trucks, facilities, and specific \nresponse equipment. We also provide in-kind \nsupport by manufacturing and donating grain \nrescue tubes used in grain entrapment situations. \nOur fabrication shop manufactures the grain \nrescue tubes, and state fire school and local \nemergency response teams train responders \non the proper use of a tube in the event of an \naccident. The Andersons has donated more \nthan 90 grain rescue tubes since 2011 to fire \ndepartments in communities the company serves \n(10 in 2021).\nINTRODUCTION\nENVIRONMENTAL\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\nGRI INDEX", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2022.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
