{"page_content": "11\nContinuing with the work started in 2020 to \nbaseline our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG impact, \nThe Andersons has calculated our 2021 GHG \nScope 1 and 2 impact shown in the chart. This \nis our second year calculating our Scope 1 and \nScope 2 GHG emissions. These charts show our \n2020 baseline GHG (Scope 1 and 2) as well as \nour 2021 GHG impact. The difference between \n2020 and 2021 primarily reflects changes in the \nbusiness as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRelative to others in our industry, The Andersons \nhas a modest combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 \nGHG impact. For the calendar year of 2021, we \nare reporting combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG \nemissions of approximately 975,000 mtns CO2e \n(see graphic). Consistent with the Supplier LoCT \nprocess, we continue to refine these calculations \nannually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG impact is \nproduced from the ownership and operations \nof just under 100 facilities located within the \nU.S. and Canada. As expected, the majority of \nScope 1 emissions are from our five ethanol \nplants. All five ethanol plants are owned as part \nof joint ventures, with The Andersons having an \napproximate 51% ownership.CO 2 EMISSIONS (GHG)\nSCOPE 2\nPurchased power created from fossil fuels.
