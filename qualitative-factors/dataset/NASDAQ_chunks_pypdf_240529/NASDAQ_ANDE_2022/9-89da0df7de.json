We are continuing to review \nour operations to locate all water usage by source \n(e.g., public utility provider, metered well, non-\nmetered well), and intend to continue to refine \nthis information. Our data and progress to date \nfor water use are shown in the chart to the right.\nSimilarly, we are continuing to review our \noperations for waste generation. Waste generated \non site at facilities owned by The Andersons \nis generally a relatively low quantity of non-\nhazardous types. Our data and progress to date \nfor waste generation are shown in the chart on \nthe bottom right.\nUsing resources purposefully is important to \nThe Andersons, and we anticipate working with \nour customers and partners to incorporate the \nconcepts of circularity into our supply chain and \nto identify ways to reduce post-harvest loss.8,000,000\n6,000,000\n4,000,000\n2,000,000\n0CUBIC METERSTHE ANDERSONS 2021 WATER USE\nTHE ANDERSONS 2021 WASTE IMPACT BY TYPE\nRECYCLED / REUSE MIXED MATERIALS\nREFUSE WASTE\nSOLID (NOT TRASH OR RECYCLED)\nThe predominate wastes generated by The Andersons are non-Hazardous. \nHazardous waste generation occurs at less than 1% of the total of all types.\n75%17%8%\n26,311\nmetrics tonsWATER USE\nThe volume of water use shown here is our best \ncorporate-wide estimation to date.
