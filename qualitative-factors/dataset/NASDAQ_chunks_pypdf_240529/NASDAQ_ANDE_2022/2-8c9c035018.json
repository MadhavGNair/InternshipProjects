Seventy-\nfive years represents a major milestone \nin our legacy of service to others, \nwhich has been a primary focus of the \ncompany since its founding in 1947. To \ncommemorate this occasion, we aspire \nto perform 75 acts of service in the \nmany communities in which we live \nand do business. For example, so far in \n2022, employees from Clymers, Indiana, \nhosted a bowling fundraiser in support \nof children\u2019s literacy through their local \nUnited Way, our Human Resources team \npacked spring baskets for the Ronald \nMcDonald House Charities of Northwest \nOhio, employees in the Metro Toledo area \nalso participated in a bowling fundraiser \nand raised more than $15,000 to support \nJunior Achievement programming, and \nmembers of The Andersons Trade and \nProcessing team packed 1,000 lunches \nfor the Harvesters food network in Kansas \nCity, Missouri. \nWe believe, however, that our obligations \nto our communities and to our customers \nextend considerably further. To be a \ngood corporate neighbor, we must set our sights on what we can do to be a \nsustainable company and to serve, with \nothers in our industry, as stewards of the \nworld we all share. \nThe Andersons has made progress in \nthe way we measure our Environmental, \nSocial, and Governance programs since \nwe first published our sustainability \nreview in 2020. Our goal is to be \nsuccessful in providing our customers \nwith products and services that are \nof value, while preserving our natural \nresources for future generations.\nToday, we share with you our 2022 \nSustainability Review. We hope you enjoy \nreading about the actions we are taking \nnow to create a more sustainable future \nfor us all.A LETTER FROM CEO PAT BOWE\nPat Bowe\nPresident and CEO\nThe AndersonsINTRODUCTION\nENVIRONMENTAL\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\nGRI INDEX", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2022.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
