For the year ended December 31, 2015, the adjustment included gains recognized on the sale of assets related to our site closures.\n(c)  The adjustments related primarily to acquisition-related expenses associated with various acquisitions including, but not limited to, non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets and changes in estimated fair values of contingent consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment included net charges associated with the discontinuance \nof the internal development of AMG 899. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the adjustment included the write-off of certain acquired in-process research and development.\n(d) The adjustment related to the recognition of an additional year of the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee, as required by final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service.\n(e) The adjustment related to the write-off of inventory primarily due to changing regulatory and reimbursement environments.\n(f)  The adjustment related to the write-off of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that was not used due to a change in manufacturing strategy.\n(g) The adjustments related primarily to non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the adjustment included bridge financing costs associated with the Onyx business combination.\n(h)  The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and non-GAAP results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions.\n(i)  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment related primarily to the impact of U.S. Corporate tax reform, including the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities. For all other years, the adjustments related to certain prior period items excluded from GAAP earnings, as well as \nresolving certain non-routine transfer-pricing and acquisition-related issues with tax authorities, as applicable.REPORTING", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2017.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
