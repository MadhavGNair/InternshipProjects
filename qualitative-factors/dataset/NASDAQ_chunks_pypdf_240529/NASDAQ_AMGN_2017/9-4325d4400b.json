We have delivered on this vision, investing billions of dollars in research and development and providing numerous innovative medicines to serve patients facing serious illnesses. We believe that medicines like ours represent the best hope to address the clinical, economic and societal burden of disease.\nConnecting patients to therapeutic innovation \ncomes with a deep sense of responsibility that surrounds and extends beyond the practice of discovering, developing and manufacturing medicines. With patients at the center of all we do, we are committed to responsible and transparent clinical trial management, supplying patients with safe, effective and high-quality products and promoting access to our medicines and health innovation through strategic initiatives, collaborative partnerships and charitable giving.    \nAccess to Medicine  \nAmgen is working across the entire healthcare \ncommunity to ensure a fertile environment for innovation and to help develop healthcare systems that enable patients to access the treatments they need through a variety of programs and strategic initiatives. In 2017, Amgen developed a new Health and Innovation Partnerships framework to coordinate a number of these efforts, with a particular emphasis    on emerging markets.
