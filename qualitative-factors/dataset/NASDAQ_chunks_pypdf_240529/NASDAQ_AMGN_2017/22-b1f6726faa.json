Our total water use company-wide in 2017 declined slightly from 2016. Water conservation projects implemented in 2017 resulted in an additional 63,000 cubic meters (CM) of annual water reduction to achieve a total of 266,000 CM since establishing our 2020 targets in 2013. We have reduced annual water usage through projects eliminating 952,000 CM, or 29 percent, since 2007. Highlights of our water conservation program in  \n2017 include: \n\u2022  Use of next-generation biomanufacturing technologies \nthat reduce the volume of water required to maintain manufacturing equipment and spaces. \n\u2022  Conservation of approximately 11,000 CM of water resulting from engineering projects to optimize heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.\nWater Intake and Intake Avoided Through Conservation Efforts (1,000 CM)  * Value represents year-over-year,  \ncumulative and continuing avoidance.Water Intake\nWater Intake Avoided* \nfrom 2007 Through 2012\nWater Intake \nAvoided* 2013+3,5004,000\n3,000\n2,5002,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n0142\n20152,520686\n20122,720686203\n2016686\n2,351266\n2017686\n2,320\n20073,28636\n2014686\n2,487ENVIRONMENT\n19\n20132,725686\nENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2017.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
