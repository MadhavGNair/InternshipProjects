In 2017, we expanded the program to nine new regions outside of the United States, with a goal of reaching 900,000 students across the globe by 2020. ABE students have shown significant learning gains in biotech, as well as an increased interest and confidence in doing science and biotechnology.In 2017, Amgen continued its partnership with the Khan Academy. The Amgen Foundation\u2019s $3 million, three-year grant allows Khan Academy to create and provide free, high-quality biology lessons for students and teachers everywhere. With the Amgen Foundation\u2019s support, Khan Academy has grown its biology offerings to more than 300 videos, 80 exercise sets and 195 articles. These resources are accessible to Khan Academy\u2019s more than 60 million registered users from across 190 countries. \nAmgen Teach, which supports science teachers across Europe by providing training workshops and distance-learning events, has reached 3,000 teachers with trainings, impacting more than 440,000 students in 10 countries over the past three years.
