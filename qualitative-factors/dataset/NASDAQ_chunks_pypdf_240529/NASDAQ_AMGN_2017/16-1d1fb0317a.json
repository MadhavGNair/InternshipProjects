To that end, the Amgen Foundation has contributed more than  \n$130 million to advancing science education programming globally. \nThe Amgen Scholars Program, launched in 2006, \nmakes it possible for young scientists from around the \nglobe to engage in cutting-edge research experiences and learn more about biotechnology and drug discovery. In fact, the program has opened the door for participating undergraduates from 700 colleges and universities to undertake research at elite institutions such as MIT, Stanford, Cambridge and the National Institutes of Health. There are more than 3,500 alumni since the program\u2019s inception, many of whom are now pursuing hundreds of advanced scientific degree programs and careers, including over 200 who have earned their doctorate in a scientific field.
