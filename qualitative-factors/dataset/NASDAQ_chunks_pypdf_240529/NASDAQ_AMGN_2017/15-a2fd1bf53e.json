This first phase focused on those suppliers that are most important to Amgen\u2019s business because of the nature and/or volume of products or services they provide. The Assessment, conducted by an independent third party, provides the basis for increased understanding of suppliers\u2019 performance across a wide range of issues, while ensuring that suppliers are aware of our performance expectations. Results of the Supplier Performance Assessment facilitate a dialogue with suppliers about areas where performance improvement should be focused.In the area of conflict minerals, Amgen will continue to identify, reduce and ultimately eliminate the useof conflict minerals\u2014those that directly or indirectly finance armed groups in the Democratic Republicof the Congo and surrounding countries\u2014in our products. The identification of potential use of conflict minerals in our supply chain is integrated into our Supplier Sustainability Program and  \nannual assessment.\nAmgen also has a Supplier Diversity Program \nthat is designed to provide opportunities to small, disadvantaged, women-owned, minority-owned, service-disabled-veteran-owned or veteran-owned businesses that are seeking to do business with Amgen. Two key efforts within our Supplier Diversity Program are participation in events designed to inform small and diverse businesses of opportunities to engage with Amgen and our participation in organizations devoted to the promotion of diversity in the supply chain. Amgen is a corporate member of various key national associations that support supplier diversity, such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council.
