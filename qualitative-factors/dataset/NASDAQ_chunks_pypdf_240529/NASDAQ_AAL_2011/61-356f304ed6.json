The seating capability of the aircraft will allow  for growth flexibility and provide greater ability to \nserve new long -haul markets.  \nThe Boeing 777 -300ER is 19 percent lighter than its closest competitor, and it produces 22 percent less \ncarbon dioxide per seat and costs 20 percent less to operate per sea t. In short, it is more efficient and \nenvironmentally friendly than any long -haul (or widebody) plane currently in our fleet.  \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2011.pdf", "page": 61, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
