Infrastructure Investment  \nExpansion of our business i nto new regions and communities results in far -reaching and long -term \neconomic impacts. We have found that our routes act as conduits for many forms of commerce and social \nengagement, and we truly feel that a new route represents an investment in the commu nities on both \nends.  \nNonetheless, when planning for network expansion, we proceed cautiously, deliberately and in close \ncommunication with the communities involved. This includes the completion of all necessary \nenvironmental assessments.  \nThe services and i nvestments we propose are welcomed and appreciated by the communities involved. \nIn fact, over the past 10 years, American Airlines has spent $2.4 billion on airport and facility \ninfrastructure projects, including extensive domestic upgrades.  \nIn 2011, our m ajor infrastructure investments included:  \n\uf0b7 Relocation and expansion of facilities at Los Angeles International Airport  \n\uf0b7 Concourse upgrades at New York's LaGuardia Airport  \n\uf0b7 An Admirals Club in Terminal 2 at San Francisco International Airport, which is anticipated to receive \nthe prestigious LEED Silver certification under the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in \nEnergy and Environmental Design (LEED) Commercial Interiors classification  \n\uf0b7 Improvements to the Mexico City Reservations facility  \n\uf0b7 Updates to the Admirals Club at London Heathrow Airport  \n\uf0b7 Airport facility enhancements in Brasilia, Brazil  \n4. Supplier Diversity  \nEvery business deserves the chance to succeed; yet within a fiercely competitive global marketplace, \nsmall companies, and those with minori ty or women ownership, are often underrepresented in the supply \nchain. As part of our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we believe in creating economic value on a \nlocal scale, and strengthening our connections with a varied supplier base. Not only doe s this \ncommitment to supplier diversity expand our company's procurement and partnership options, it also \nrepresents an opportunity to build our relationships with entire communities \u2014 not just business \ncommunities.  \nIn 1989 American Airlines created a Dive rsified Supplier Program, establishing a formalized process for \nthe engagement of small businesses and those with minority, LGBT and women ownership. Overseen by \nthe Diversity Committee of the AMR Board of Directors, this program is reviewed annually to he lp \ndetermine the best strategies for managing supplier diversity throughout our company. In recent years, \nour approach has included the establishment of diversity mandates for our Tier 1 suppliers, creating an \neven broader network of minority - , LGBT - and women -owned suppliers impacted by our business. Since \nthe program was established, American has spent in excess of $4 billion with diverse suppliers and we \ncontinue to focus on fostering growth in this important segment within the communities we serve.
