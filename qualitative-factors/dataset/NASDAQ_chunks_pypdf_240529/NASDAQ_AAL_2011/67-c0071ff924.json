{"page_content": "67 \n 2. U.S. Congres s Successfully Passes FAA Reauthorization Bill  \nIn 2012, the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate reached an agreement on \nlegislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration for four years (through 2015) and to continue \nraising revenue for the Airport and Airways Trust Fund. The President signed the measure on February \n14, 2012. This funding, totaling approximately $63 billion, will help the U.S. air traffic control (ATC) system \nmanage the growing demand for U.S. air travel. Improvements in ATC technology and equipment will also \nhelp airlines fly more efficient routes.  \nAmerican Airlines governmental affairs team participated in an industry coalition formed under the \nauspices of Airlines for America (A4A), formerly known as the  Air Transport Association of America, Inc. \n(ATA), to lobby for passage of the bill. The success of the legislation provides the means for the FAA to \npursue safety, modernization and capacity projects at airports across the United States, including $500 \nmillion annually for security improvement projects.  \nAdditional provisions in the FAA reauthorization relate to support for essential air service, directives on \nunmanned aircraft systems, transportation of lithium batteries, and a commitment to development of  the \nNext-Generation Air Transportation System. The law also reflects Congressional consensus that the \nEuropean Union should not extend its emissions trading (EU ETS) proposal to international civil aviation \nwithout working through ICAO.  \n \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2011.pdf", "page": 67, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
