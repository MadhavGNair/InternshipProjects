The twister reached its maximum intensity of \n\"EF4\" on the Enhanced Fujita Scale in the town of \nBridgeton, just before striking St. Louis I nternational \nAirport. As the storm passed through, flying debris \nshattered windows and blocked runways, while a portion \nof the roof was torn from Concourse C \u2014 home of \nAmerican's operations.  \nDespite extensive damage to the airport terminal, minimal \ninjurie s occurred, and American pilots, crewmembers and \nairport personnel raced to assist stranded and frightened \ncustomers and to restore operations.  \nOver the course of the Easter weekend, an outpouring of employee volunteers and support staff from \nAmerican's Ag ent Away program worked tirelessly to clean up damage at the airport, and, by the \nfollowing Monday morning, helped to resume flight operations at nearly full capacity from temporary \nstations in Concourse D.  \nIn a statement, Capt. John Hale, American's Vice President \u2014 Flight, expressed his appreciation for the \ncoordinated employee efforts that made the cleanup possible: \"People stepped up to the plate and made \nit happen. Employees were immediately on site following the tornado, volunteering their time and do ing \nwhat they could to make things better.\"  \n \n  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2011.pdf", "page": 78, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
