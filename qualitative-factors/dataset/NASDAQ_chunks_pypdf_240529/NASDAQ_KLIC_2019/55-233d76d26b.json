{"page_content": "In FY2019, K&S generated a total of 502 tons of solid waste which was a 35% reduction compared to FY2018. This reduction \nwas mainly attributed to the drop in production volume recorded for FY2019. On the contrary, K&S has improved its recycling \nrate to 54% from 50% in the previous year. Specifically, in its Suzhou site, the waste handling program improved its recycling \nrate by 14% in FY2019. Solid waste comprises mainly of packaging materials like plastics, wood and paper. Electronic waste \nsuch as batteries and lamps were recycled. Hazardous waste increased in FY2019 due to inclusion of chemical packaging, \nliquid and sludge chemicals in Suzhou. Higher capacity and lowering pollutant concentration in waste water resulted in \nincrease in hazardous waste. Paper is used in supporting K&S\u2019 mainstream business operations. The paper reduction \ninitiatives include educating employees on 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle), implementing paperless processes and periodic \nmonitoring and reporting of paper usage.  In FY2019, paper usage achieved 20% reduction by weight.\nBreakdown of Solid Waste Paper Usage\nFigure 28: Charts showing K&S \nmonitoring of Solid Waste, Paper \nUsage and Hazardous WasteEach of the six sites have put in \nplace waste recycling initiatives \nwhich includes upcycling packaging \nmaterials to create decorative pieces. \nSubsequently, these recycled materials \nare also sent for further recycling.\nAt Suzhou, where many chemicals are \nused in the manufacturing process, \nwaste chemicals are carefully treated \nbefore discharge. One of the initiatives \nimplemented was to redirect acids used \nfor products cleaning into the on-site \nwaste water treatment facility. The \nwaste acids then undergo pH treatment \nand can be reused for cleaning. In \naddition, the large volume of waste \nwater generated from manufacturing is \nbeing used to flush toilets.Responsible Waste \nDisposal \nBreakdown of Hazardous Waste\nSingapore, Eindhoven and \nSanta Ana make up less than \n1% of total hazardous waste \ngenerated CY2017 FY2018 FY2019Recycled wast e Non-recycled Solid wasteCY2017 FY2018 FY2019800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n09001000\n54%29%\n50% 46% 71%720\n502769\n50%Solid Waste  (ton)\nPaper Usage (kg)Hazardous Waste (ton)\nCY2017 FY2018 FY201920,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n025,00030,000\n40\n30\n20\n10\n05060\n16,518 27,32331.3\n23.130.6\n20,529\n16,518 20,529\nPaper usage per net revenue (kg/million $US)\n86%5%8%15%\n4%2%11%\n80%86%204219245\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0Suzhou\nFort W ashington\nHaifa\nSingapore, Eindhoven \nand Santa  Ana \n56", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2019.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
