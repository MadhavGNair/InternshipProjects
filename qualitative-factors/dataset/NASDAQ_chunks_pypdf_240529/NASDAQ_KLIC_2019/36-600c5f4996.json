{"page_content": "A student-run team from the University of Michigan unveiled their first ever electric race car at the Michigan \nElectric Racing (MER) in June 2019. In response to the changing trends in the automotive industry, the team \ndecided to transition from hybrid to full-electric vehicles (EVs). These EVs do not produce emissions and can \nbe charged with energy generated from renewable sources, thus reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.  \nK&S is proud to be one of MER\u2019s platinum sponsors supporting the wedge bonding of the electric battery \npack, powering the all-electric vehicle. The electric race car subsequently led MER to be placed second out \nof 13 teams at Formula North in Canada. The team completed all dynamic events and was placed within the \ntop three in each event. K&S sends its heartiest congratulations to the MER19 team!Supporting Innovation in Clean Energy\n37", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2019.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
