{"page_content": "Kulicke & Soffa collaborated with a leading enterprise IT company to create a demo tool that guides \ncustomers on performing maintenance on K&S bonders using Augmented Reality (AR). A standard tablet \nfitted with AR is used to identify the machine part for maintenance. Through AR, the tablet will display the \nDigital Standard Operating Procedure which provides step-by-step visual guides on the procedures of the \nmaintenance process. This gives an enhanced user experience and reduces human error. Furthermore, \nK&S has also expanded its use to a similar AR-aided training program for employees in the manufacturing \ndepartment. This AR demo tool was showcased at the SEMICON Southeast Asia 2019 trade show and it \nwas well received.
