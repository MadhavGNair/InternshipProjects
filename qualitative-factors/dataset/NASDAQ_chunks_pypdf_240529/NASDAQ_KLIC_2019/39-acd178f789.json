{"page_content": "K&S also employs an Issue Escalation Flow system which handles customer \nfeedback and grievances. For Escalation Levels 1 and 2, Field Service Teams \nand Technical Support Teams will engage with customers to resolve issues faced \nsuch as performance issues, part failures or technical enquiries. Should the \nissue remain unresolved, the Issue Tracking System (ITS) owners will step in to \nsupport the investigation and expedite the resolution with the customer. Issues \nescalated to Level 3 and above will be logged in the ITS. The Customer Quality \nFigure 20: K&S Issue Escalation Flow\nEngineering (CQE) team periodically monitors the escalated issues to ensure \ntimely and effective closure. Through work instruction (WI) enhancements or \nintroduction of early detection methods, they aim to prevent recurrences in the \nfuture. Cases will also be shared with team members during technical toolbox \nmeetings. In FY2019, about 80% of field issues were resolved at escalation level \n1.
