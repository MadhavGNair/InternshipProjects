The report builds on \nAmerican's 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report , 2008 Corporate Responsibility Report  (the company's first integrated \nreport), the 2007 Environmental Responsibility Report , and the 2007 Corporate Citizenship Report . The 2010 Corporate \nResponsibility Report encompasses the activi ties of AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines and its \nregional affiliate, American Eagle. \nWe view the publication of each annual corporate responsibi lity report as an opportunity to continue our dialogue with \nstakeholders. We also strive to highlight the alignment of our corporate responsibi lity efforts with our overall corporate goal s, \nas stated in Flight Plan 2020 , our strategic framework. \nWe see reporting as a process of continuous improvement, each year building on the past. As such, we consider the \nprecautionary principle in identifying topics that need to be addressed in our reporting as potentially posing risk to our \norganization either now or in the future, and build th is concept into our mate riality analysis process. \nWith regard to data collection and tracking, American transitio ned in 2009 to the Environmental Protection Agency's Climate \nLeaders methodology to calculate the company's total carbon foot print . This methodology incorporates different emissions \nfactors than were used in previous years, and because a fuller range of sources is tracked, represents a more conservative \nestimate of total emissions. \nWe welcome your feedback on our corporat e responsibility efforts and this report.
