These grass-roots, employee-led organizations center on gender, ethnicity, re ligion, abilities, military experience, \nsexual orientation, and other comm on interests of their members. \nERGs are dedicated to promoting their members\u2019 professi onal development, raising cultural awareness, and providing \ninsight to the company for business decisions on internal po licies, communications, and marketing initiatives. In this \ncapacity, ERGs contribute significantly to our diversity effo rts on behalf of both employees and cu stomers. At the same time, \nthey\u2019re responsible for an enormous volume of volunteerism, c haritable giving, and fundraising for many causes. In short, \nthey are a powerful factor in helping to make American a great place to work. \nIn 2010, the Asian-Pacific Islander Employee Resource Gr oup, or APIERG, played a pivotal role in opening up our new \nAsian routes. Group members served as translators at meeti ngs and events. They provided training and cultural advice to \nflight attendants and other personnel who would be coming into contact with customers on the new routes, to help them \nbetter understand and address customer expectations in an unf amiliar culture. The group even helped design in-flight \nmenus for the new routes. And, of course, APIERG helped mark et the inauguration of the rout es through promotional events \nand social media. \nMeanwhile, this very active group carried on with its usual volunteerism and fundraising for such organizations as Big \nBrothers and Big Sisters, and chambers of commerce in vari ous cities. Through our American Giving program, APIERG \nraised over $4,000 and 20 carloads of clothing for victims of the Philippines Flood; $1,200 fo r Easter Seals North Texas, \nbenefiting children and adults with disabiliti es; and funds for Haiti earthquake victims. \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2010.pdf", "page": 79, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
