{"page_content": "25 \n In late summer 2010, American became the first airline to util ize a publicly available, commercially designed instrument flight  \nprocedure, ushering in a new era in airspace modernization. On  August 26, 2010, Flight 1916 from Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) \nto Bradley Airport (BDL) in Hartford, Connecticut, introduced \u201cHighways in the Sk y,\u201d a procedure to reduce delays, slash \naircraft CO2 emissions, reduce noise, and im prove airline operating efficiency. \n\"Highways in the Sky\" lets pilots use onboard technology to follow a precise track, independent of aging ground - based \nnavigation beacons that limit an aircra ft's flight-path options. Designed by Na verus, part of GE Aviation, the path \nincorporates Required Navigation Perf ormance (RNP) technology, a core component of the FAA's NextGen airspace \nmodernization plan. RNP paths can be custom-tailored to r educe airport congestion, shorten trip distance, reduce an \naircraft\u2019s time in flight, and create comm unity-friendly flight trajec tories that lessen the e ffect of aircraft noise. \nNavigational and operational capabilities such as these will make  air traffic management more e fficient by helping airlines \nplan more direct routes. Without new RNP flight paths and other essential upgrades, the FAA estimates that the current air \ntraffic control system will be unable to handle the 50 percent incr ease in air traffic that is projected in the next decade. \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2010.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
