{"page_content": "31 \n ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY \nManaging environmental issues at American \nAmerican Airlines and American Eagle implemented an Environmental Management  System (EMS) almost 20 years ago. \nModeled on the ISO 14001 standard, the EMS encompasses elements including environmental policy, planning, \nimplementation and training, audits and co rrective actions, and management review. The EMS covers our U.S. operations. \nIn 2010, we performed 59 internal audits, including audits at all major airport operations and maintenance bases. As part of \nthe EMS plan, we aim to audit all maintenance bases, all ma jor airport operations, and smalle r airport operations on a risk-\nbased schedule\u2014approximately once every three years. \nAs part of our management approach, we expect to main tain 100 percent compliance with all applicable laws and \nregulations. We have achieved consistently strong envir onmental performance. In 2010 the U.S. EPA cited one of \nAmerican's airport locations for not main taining sufficient aisle space between waste containers at its Central Accumulation \nArea (the area used to store waste prior to being shipped off fo r disposal). American has addressed this issue, and the EPA \ndid not assess a penalty for this citation. No other  citations or penalties were assessed in 2010. \nWith regard to oversight of our environmental performance,  the Managing Director of Cor porate Environmental reports \ndirectly to the Vice President of Safety, Security and Environment, who reports annually to the Board of Directors. \nAdministratively, this Vice President reports directly to AMR's Executive Vice President of Oper ations who, in turn, reports \ndirectly to AMR's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Gerard Arpey. \nAmerican manages its environmental pe rformance across three core focus areas:  \n\u2022 Direct energy (jet fuel) consumption and related GHG em issions, addressed through the Fuel Smart Program  \n\u2022 Indirect energy and water use and conservation, addressed th rough the activities of the Utilities Management Council  \n\u2022 Waste, recycling, and materials use r eduction: activities directed by the newly formed Waste Minimization Team  \nEnvironmental Policy and Commitment Statement \nThe AMR Environmental Policy governs our company's approa ch to protecting and preserving the environment.
