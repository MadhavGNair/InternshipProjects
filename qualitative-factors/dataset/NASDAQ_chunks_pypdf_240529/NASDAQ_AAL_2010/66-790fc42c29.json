Under  that plan, profit sharing \npayments are made to eligible employees if our annual pre-ta x earnings exceed $500 million. By its terms, our officers \n(including the named executive officers) and certain other management  employees are not eligible to participate in the Profit \nSharing Plan. However, under the AIP t he Compensation Committee has the discretion to award cash payments to these \nofficers and management employees if the other employees of American Airlines receive prof it sharing payments under the \nProfit Sharing Plan. No such payments were made in 2010. \nTotal compensation for AMR executives includes a mix of bas e salary and \u201cat-risk\u201d compensat ion. At-risk compensation is \nprimarily provided through grants of st ock-based compensation and participation in compensation plans tied to achieving \nstrategic, financial, and operational  goals and performance measures. \nIn 2010, an average of 70 percent of the to tal compensation awarded to the five named executive officers listed in our proxy \nwas in the form of long-term stock compensation, which means that compensation is at risk,  or not guaranteed. For those \nnamed executive officers, on average, only 15 percent of income  is \u201cguaranteed\u201d due to the uncertainty associated with \nstock-based and short-term incentive compensation. Less than 25 percent of all officers' income is salary-based or \n\"guaranteed\". Approximately 94 percent of  front-line employees' income is sala ry/wage-based or \"guaranteed.\u201d None of our \nnamed executive officers received a base salary increase in 2010. \nThe Compensation Committee has linked our named executiv e officers\u2019 performance-based compensation to these \nmeasures: pre-tax profits, customer serv ice, stock price appreciation, and total shareholder return. Due to the financial and \neconomic challenges facing the airline industry, linking ex ecutive pay to company performance has resulted in our \nexecutives only realizing approximately 61 percent of the total compensation that  was granted to them for the years 2000 \nthrough 2009.  \nDetailed information regarding our merit-based executive pay system is available in our 2010 Proxy Statement . \nCorporate responsibility management structure \nAt AMR, our responsibility includes doing our part to influenc e global solutions to challenging environmental, social, and \neconomic issues for the benefit of our stakeholders, now and for generations to come. The scale of our operations affords us \nthe opportunity to affect positive change around the world in t he many ways we intersect with our environment, customers, \nand communities\u2014and internally among our own employee ranks.  \nBecause of the breadth and diversity of the activities that relate to corporate re sponsibility initiati ves, our Citizenship \nSteering Committee is composed of senior executives r epresenting different business areas within the company. \nThe Steering Committee meets quarterly and provides over all guidance and strategic vision on AMR's corporate \nresponsibility approach.
