{"page_content": "47 \n Workforce reductions \nAs with many industries, we experience financially challenging per iods from time to time which may require us to reduce the \nsize of our workforce to meet the needs of the business.  When this occurs, reductions generally come from both \nmanagement and nonmanagement ranks as well as  from unionized and independent employee groups. \nAmerican and American Eagle recalled or hired over 3,600 employees in 2010. \nIn 2010, we were delighted to welcome ba ck 273 Flight Attendants and 192 Pilots who were recalled or rehired to active \nduty. Our ability to recall employees can be attributed to a number of factors including efforts to capitalize on new international flying and business opportunities with British Airways and Iberia and with Japan Airlines, and the continued \nstrengthening of our cornerstone hubs. \nFor union-represented employees (such as pilots, flight a ttendants, mechanics, and ramp em ployees), collective bargaining \nagreements specify procedures for reductions in force and related severance, as well as for recall back to the company, with \nappropriate retraining, when vacancies arise. Similar procedur es apply for reservations representatives and airport agents. \nFor management and administrative staff, American has well-deve loped, merit-based, and equitable practices for reductions \nin force. In most cases American provides access to j ob boards, listings, and other resources for finding new employment. \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2010.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
