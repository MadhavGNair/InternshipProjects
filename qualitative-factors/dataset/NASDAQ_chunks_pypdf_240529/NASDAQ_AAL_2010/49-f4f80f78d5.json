This followed the 2009 Open Skies Agreement si gned by the United States and Japan liberalizing air travel \nbetween the two countries. Open Skies, co mbined with antitrust immunity for American Airlines and Japan Airlines, will \nstimulate U.S.\u2013Japan travel as well as business and tourism travel between the United States and Asia. \nOur new nonstop flight from Chicago to Beijing, along with our existing Chicago to Shanghai flight, encourages U.S. \u2013 China \ntravel for both business and tourism. The designation of the Unit ed States as an official group tourism country for Chinese \ncitizens, in combination with American's nonstop flights to Chi na's two leading cities, will facilitate growth in U.S. \u2013 China \ntravel. American's oneworld relationship with Cathay Pacific and Dragonair provides additional destinations for travelers to \nHong Kong and China.
