{"page_content": "71 \n American Airlines views investment in NextGen as critical to  the efficiency of the aviation industry. Our current generation of  \nair traffic control systems, emissions management, and safety leave significant room for im provement in surveillance, \nnavigation, and safety-enhancing equipment. \nAmerican and Naverus, a part of GE Aviation, marked a major milestone in U.S. airspace modernization in August 2010 with \nAmerican flight 1916 from DFW to Hartford. The flight debuted t he first-ever public flight path in the United States created by  \na private company. Known as Required Navigation Performance (RNP), this flight procedure is a core component of the \nFAA NextGen airspace modernization effort and is like a \"highway in the sky\" that ensures the aircraft adheres to a precisely \ndesigned, predetermined path. \nAlthough the DFW flight is a step in the ri ght direction, we continue to advocate for an infusion of government infrastructure \nfunding to jumpstart the modernization of t he air traffic control system. Modernization  would also result in reduced carbon \nemissions and job creation in the aviation sector. We strongly believe that an infusion of funding to help equip all aircraft w ith \nthe necessary technology for NextGen would not only cont ribute to economic growth and a better environment, but would \nalso help address record delays and congestion. \nNextGen would bring tangible improvements to our sector, including up to a 12 per cent reduction in GHG emissions from \naircraft by 2025 (the equivalent of removing 2.2 million cars off the road) and the creation of 77,000 new jobs throughout the \nmanufacturing, equipment installa tion, and airline industries. \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2010.pdf", "page": 70, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
