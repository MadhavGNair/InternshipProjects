We \nare also using our platform to advance a pipeline of partnered and wholly-owned drug \ndiscovery programs spanning a wide range of targets and indications. We began more \nthan 30 years ago by licensing our software to major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies around the world to improve their drug discovery efforts. Approximately 15 \nyears ago, we began collaborating with companies to deploy our technology and advance \ntheir high-priority drug discovery programs. And, more recently, we have begun using \nour platform in-house to produce a portfolio of novel, high-value therapeutics.
