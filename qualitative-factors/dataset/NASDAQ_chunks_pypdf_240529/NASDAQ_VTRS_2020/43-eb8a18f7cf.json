Our facilities are equipped with air emission control \ndevices as required to manage regulated air pollutants. Examples \ninclude high-efficiency dust collection, HEPA filtration, electrostatic \nprecipitation, primary and secondary condensers, multi-stage \nfiltration and recirculation systems, process scrubber technology \nand regenerative thermal oxidizers.\nPharmaceuticals in the Environment \nThe primary pathways for pharmaceuticals entering the \nenvironment from human use are by normal patient excretion \nand improper disposal of medicine by consumers1 in addition \nto the use of pharmaceuticals in agriculture. A significantly \nsmaller contribution stems from emissions resulting from the \npharmaceutical manufacturing process. \nWhile gaps remain in the scientific link between pharmaceuticals \nin the environment and human health risk, we are committed to \nreducing pharmaceuticals discharged from our manufacturing \noperations. The company\u2019s approach to addressing and minimizing \nthe potential impact of pharmaceuticals in the environment (PiE) from our own manufacturing is based on a wide range of activities \nand governance:\n\u2022 Risk and Impact Evaluation\n\u2022 Risk Reduction and Control\n\u2022 Engagement and Policy\nWe are an active participant in the Eco-Pharmaco-Stewardship \nInter-Association Initiative, a cross- industry collaboration on \nenvironmental issues such as responsible effluent management \nand appropriate disposal of unused medicine.\nExternal initiatives that we engage on regarding manufacturing and \nthe environment:\n\u2022 CDP\n\u2022 AMR Industry Alliance\n \u00bbBoard Member\n \u00bbManufacturing Work Group\n\u2022 Medicines for Europe\n \u00bbEnvironment, Health and Safety Work Group\n\u2022 Inter Association Initiative on Pharmaceuticals in the \nEnvironment Task Force\n\u2022 Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India Related Sources\n1Royal Society of Chemistry: Sources of Pharmaceutical \nResidues in the Environment and their ControlLong-term environmental goals \nAs we progress in the integration of the new company, including \nthe organizational changes announced in December 2020 which \nwill impact our operational and environmental footprint, we are \nplanning to perform a scenario and risk analysis in 2021.
