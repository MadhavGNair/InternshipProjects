On any given day, \nbetween 60 and 100 percent of the renewable energy it uses is generated onsite \nthrough directed biogas fuel cells and two 20-megawatt solar arrays\u2014the nation\u2019s \nlargest privately owned renewable energy installation\u2014and we purchase any  \nremaining power we need from entirely clean sources. The Maiden center generates \n167 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy onsite per year\u2014enough to power  \nthe equivalent of 13,837  homes.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nEnergy from these zero-carbon projects displaces more polluting forms of energy, \nsuch as coal, from serving our data center power needs. Our renewable energy will be \ntracked in the North Carolina Renewable Energy Tracking System and overseen by the \nNorth Carolina Utilities Commission, and we will retire the renewable energy credits \nfrom our facilities so they can\u2019t be sold or put to any other use. The renewable energy \nprojects we\u2019ve already built in North Carolina have an annual generation capacity  \nthat exceeds the 162 million kWh our data center consumed during fiscal year 2013, \nbut we will continue to expand our energy production capabilities as our data center \nneeds grow. \nWe sometimes need to purchase green energy from the grid\u2014for example, while \nwe\u2019re building additional power generation capabilities. We make those purchases \nthrough NC GreenPower and require that all renewable energy credits are Green-e \nEnergy certified, eligible for the North Carolina Renewable Portfolio Standard, and \ngenerated within the state.\nMaiden, North Carolina\u2014 100% renewable since opening June 20 10\nPrineville, Oregon\u2014 100% renewable since opening May 20 12 \nReno, Nevada\u2014 100% renewable since opening December 2012\nNewark, California\u2014 100% renewable since January 20 13\nDuke Ener gy D efault G rid M ix\nNuclear 52%\nCoal 35%Other 13%\nRenewable <1%\n2013 Default Emissions 75836\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nFrom Duke Energy Carolinas 2013 Statistical \nSupplement generation dataApple Renewable Capacity\nPV1 24%\nPV2 24%Fuel Cells 47%\nNC GreenPower 5%\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nPaci\ufb01c Power Default Grid Mix \nCoal 65%\nNatural Gas 13%\nOther 17%\nRenewable 5%\n2013 Default Emissions 9965\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nwww.oregon.gov/energy/pages/\noregons_electric_power_mix.aspxApple Renewable CapacityOregon Wind 99%\nUtility Green 1%\n2013 Effective Emissions 0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nNV Default Grid Mix Natural Gas 47%\nCoal 34%\nOther 8%Renewable 11%\n2013 Default Emissions 1095\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nNV Energy North Power Content Insert, November 2013\nPaci\ufb01c Gas & Electric  Default Grid Mix \nNatural Gas 27%\nNuclear 21%\nOther 33%\nRenewable 19%2013 Default Emissions 36,959\n(mtons CO 2e/year)Apple Renewable Capacity\nBundled Grid (mostly wind) 56%\nGrid (mostly wind) 43%\nOnsite >1%\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nApple Renewable CapacityLocal Geothermal 100%\n(PV Forthcoming)\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nwww.pge.com/myhome/edusafety/\nsystemworks/electric/energymix", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2014.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
