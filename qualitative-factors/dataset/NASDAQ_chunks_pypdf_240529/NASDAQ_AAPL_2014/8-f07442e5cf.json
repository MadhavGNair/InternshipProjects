We hit this milestone in January 2013, \nwhen we began serving the data center with energy sourced primarily from California \nwind power.

We also use third-party colocation facilities for \nadditional data center capacity. While Apple doesn\u2019t own these shared facilities and \nuses only a portion of their total capacity, we include them in our renewable energy \ngoals. And we are working with these providers to ensure that our energy load is  \nprovided in the cleanest way possible. Since early 2013, over 70 percent of our power \nfor colocated facilities has come from renewable sources, and we won\u2019t stop until we \nget to 100 percent.\nOur retail stores\nNext in our sights are our more than 400 Apple Retail Stores across the world. It\u2019s no \neasy feat, because in many cases a store\u2019s electric meter is in a landlord\u2019s name, not \nApple\u2019s. And many states and countries don\u2019t offer the ability to directly purchase \nrenewable energy. But so far we have been able to convert more than 140 of our U.S. \nretail stores, and all 21 of our Australian stores, to 100 percent renewable energy by \neither purchasing from third-party renewable energy providers or participating in  \nutility green tariff programs that meet our rigorous standards.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2014.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
