Ourdisplay glass has beenaresnic-free since 2008.\nWe design products with safer materials.\nDesigning greener products means considering the environmental impact of the  \nmaterials used to make them. From the glass, plastic, and metal in our products to  \nthe paper and ink in our packaging, we\u2019re conscious of how those materials affect our \nproducts as well as our environment. We continue to lead the industry in reducing  \nor eliminating environmentally harmful substances, and we\u2019re continually striving to \nmake our products the cleanest and safest they can be.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProduct testing \nTesting for toxins begins at home.\nWe work closely with our suppliers to make sure our products are free from the  \nharmful substances we specify. And we go to great lengths to confirm that. In  \nfact, it\u2019s the mission of the Environmental Testing Lab we built at our headquarters  \nin Cupertino. There we submit our products\u2019 components to rigorous analysis\u2014  \nincluding X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and ion chromatography\u2014to literally  \nsee what they\u2019re made of.\nSee Appendix A , Apple\u2019s Environmental Health and Safety Policy statement.\nIon chromatography is just one of several \nmethods our Environmental Testing Lab  \nuses to ensure the safety of our products.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2014.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
