We\u2019re shipping more and more products \nper trip, and the savings is adding up. Along with designing the iPhone 5s box to be \n41 percent smaller in volume than the first iPhone box, we\u2019ve also redesigned our \niMac packaging. The slanted shape of the iMac box makes it easier to stack more \non each shipping pallet. So more products can be shipped in one trip, resulting in \nfewer emissions.\n \nRecycling\nKeeping recycling local.\nAll electronic waste we collect worldwide is processed in the region where it\u2019s  \ncollected\u2014nothing is shipped overseas for disposal. The vast majority of our  \nrecycling is handled in-region, too, keeping our transportation-related greenhouse  \ngas emissions low. We currently work with 153 partners around the globe whose  \nfacilities are rigorously evaluated annually on health and safety, environmental  \ncompliance, material tracking, social responsibility, and other Apple mandates. more iPhone 5s boxes in each airline shipping \ncontainer.
