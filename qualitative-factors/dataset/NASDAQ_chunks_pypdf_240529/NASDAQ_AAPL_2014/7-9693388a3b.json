We\u2019re building a micro-hydro system that will harness the power of water \nthat flows through local irrigation canals. When completed in 2014, it will serve most of \nthe center\u2019s energy needs. In the meantime, since Oregon allows the direct wholesale \npurchase of renewable energy, we\u2019re able to directly access enough local wind energy  \nto power the entire data center.\nMaiden, North Carolina\u2014 100% renewable since opening June 20 10\nPrineville, Oregon\u2014 100% renewable since opening May 20 12 \nReno, Nevada\u2014 100% renewable since opening December 2012\nNewark, California\u2014 100% renewable since January 20 13\nDuke Ener gy D efault G rid M ix\nNuclear 52%\nCoal 35%Other 13%\nRenewable <1%\n2013 Default Emissions 75836\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nFrom Duke Energy Carolinas 2013 Statistical \nSupplement generation dataApple Renewable Capacity\nPV1 24%\nPV2 24%Fuel Cells 47%\nNC GreenPower 5%\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nPaci\ufb01c Power Default Grid Mix \nCoal 65%\nNatural Gas 13%\nOther 17%\nRenewable 5%2013 Default Emissions 9965\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nwww.oregon.gov/energy/pages/\noregons_electric_power_mix.aspxApple Renewable Capacity\nOregon Wind 99%\nUtility Green 1%\n2013 Effective Emissions 0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nNV Default Grid Mix Natural Gas 47%\nCoal 34%\nOther 8%Renewable 11%\n2013 Default Emissions 1095\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nNV Energy North Power Content Insert, November 2013\nPaci\ufb01c Gas & Electric  Default Grid Mix \nNatural Gas 27%\nNuclear 21%\nOther 33%\nRenewable 19%2013 Default Emissions 36,959\n(mtons CO 2e/year)Apple Renewable Capacity\nBundled Grid (mostly wind) 56%\nGrid (mostly wind) 43%\nOnsite >1%\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nApple Renewable Capacity\nLocal Geothermal 100%\n(PV Forthcoming)\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nwww.pge.com/myhome/edusafety/\nsystemworks/electric/energymix\nReno, Nevada\nOur newest data center, in Reno, Nevada, follows in the footsteps of our 100 percent \nrenewable energy centers in Maiden and Prineville. We\u2019re working with the local  \nutility to codevelop an 18- to 20-megawatt solar array using a new kind of photovol -\ntaic panel with curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight. Expected to be operational in \nearly 2015, the solar array will have an annual production capacity of over 43 million \nkilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy. Apple is using a unique approach in which \nwe codevelop the solar array with NV Energy, the local utility: Apple designs, finances, \nand constructs the array, and NV Energy operates it. In support of this project, Apple \nworked with NV Energy and the utility commission to create a new green energy \noption in Nevada that\u2019s open to all commercial customers. Until the array comes \nonline, the data center will be powered by local renewable geothermal energy pur -\nchased from the utility.\nMaiden, North Carolina\u2014 100% renewable since opening June 20 10\nPrineville, Oregon\u2014 100% renewable since opening May 20 12 \nReno, Nevada\u2014 100% renewable since opening December 2012\nNewark, California\u2014 100% renewable since January 20 13\nDuke Ener gy D efault G rid M ix\nNuclear 52%\nCoal 35%Other 13%\nRenewable <1%\n2013 Default Emissions 75836\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nFrom Duke Energy Carolinas 2013 Statistical \nSupplement generation dataApple Renewable Capacity\nPV1 24%\nPV2 24%Fuel Cells 47%\nNC GreenPower 5%\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nPaci\ufb01c Power Default Grid Mix \nCoal 65%\nNatural Gas 13%\nOther 17%\nRenewable 5%\n2013 Default Emissions 9965\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nwww.oregon.gov/energy/pages/\noregons_electric_power_mix.aspxApple Renewable Capacity\nOregon Wind 99%\nUtility Green 1%\n2013 Effective Emissions 0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nNV Default Grid Mix Natural Gas 47%\nCoal 34%\nOther 8%Renewable 11%\n2013 Default Emissions 1095\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nNV Energy North Power Content Insert, November 2013\nPaci\ufb01c Gas & Electric  Default Grid Mix \nNatural Gas 27%\nNuclear 21%\nOther 33%\nRenewable 19%\n2013 Default Emissions 36,959\n(mtons CO 2e/year)Apple Renewable CapacityBundled Grid (mostly wind) 56%\nGrid (mostly wind) 43%\nOnsite >1%\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nApple Renewable Capacity\nLocal Geothermal 100%\n(PV Forthcoming)\n2013 Effective Emissions  0\n(mtons CO 2e/year)\nOctober 2013 renewable c apacit y  \nwww.pge.com/myhome/edusafety/\nsystemworks/electric/energymix", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2014.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
