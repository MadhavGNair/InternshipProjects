In Israel, a plant was shut down on 26 March 2021; in Singapore, all non-essential lights were switched off for two hours from 8 pm to 10 pm. At our USA and Netherlands sites, all air-conditioning units, lighting, and non-essential equipment were also switched off. Collectively, we saved more than 1,000 kg of CO\n2 emissions this year.\nMoving Towards a Sustainable \nFuture \nAt K&S Netherlands, employees are encouraged \nto ride their bicycles to work, promoting a healthier lifestyle and significantly reducing the impact of our transport. Through this Cycling-to-Work Challenge initiative, we managed to reduce 906 kg of CO\n2 emissions in the first half of the year. \nWe also collected empty cartridges and sold them to remanufacturers who would prepare them for re-use. Money collected from the sold cartridges was used to support the AAP Foundation, an international animal welfare organization focused on protecting animals. \nThis year, K&S partnered with the Jewish National Fund (JNF) in \u201cPlanting Hope for the Future\u201d to celebrate the Tu BiShvat Jewish holiday, which means \u201cNew Year of the Trees\u201d and is celebrated on 28 January by raising ecological awareness and planting trees. Donations were made online through JNF\u2019s website to plant a tree in the name of each of our 76 employees at the Haifa site. These efforts were dedicated to the restoration of the Galilee Landscape Forest which were affected by a fire in October 2020. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2021.pdf", "page": 60, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
