At Israel, we packed and distributed food packages to underserved families in Israel, including 40 Holocaust survivors. We also partnered with FoodBank Singapore, Kechara Soup Bank Malaysia, and Andrew Charity Association in Taiwan \u2013 all of which are non-profit organizations that serve homeless and marginalized individuals in the community by collecting excess food from food suppliers and re-distributing them to places such as old folks\u2019 homes, family service centers and soup kitchens.\nIn Singapore, Fort Washington, and the Netherlands, we also refurbished and donated old monitors, computers, and laptops to charities and other non-profit organizations. With many schools switching to Home-Based Learning to cope with the COVID-19 restrictions, this initiative was particularly beneficial for children in needy families who were unable to afford new computers and laptops. Besides technological devices, 181 pieces of cloths and goods were donated to the Beautiful Store, a social welfare organization in Korea which distributes them to orphanages and nursing homes. In addition, face shields, disposable shoe covers, and medical N95 masks, amounting to US$5,000, were donated to the local government in Taiwan to augment their COVID-19 response.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2021.pdf", "page": 59, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
