We source from a mix of local, regional and global suppliers to ensure business continuity in the event of disruption and prevent costly downtime. By FY2022, we will look to increase procurement from local or regional suppliers by 15%, reducing transportation activities that translates to a reduction in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nAt present, we work with more than 1,500 suppliers across Asia, Europe, the United States, and the Middle East, who support our global requirements for manufacturing related and non-manufacturing related materials.SUPPLY CHAIN SPEND TREND BREAKDOWN\n29%*Direct\nSuppliers\n71%*Indirect\nSuppliers\nManufacturing-related materials \nsuch as mechanical modules, \nconsoles and fabricated sub-\nassembliesPackaging or non-\nmanufacturing-related materials/\nservices IT and facility-related \nservices18%*Tier 1\n82%*Tier 2\nStrategic suppliers ranked first or \nsecond in respective commodity \nspendAll other approved suppliers\nAmount Spent by\nGeographical RegionBreakdown of Regional and Non-Regional Suppliers \nRegional Non-Regional SuppliersSingapore75% 25%\nSuzhou95% 5%\nNetherlands28%\nHaifa50%72% EUROPE12%\nASIA70%USA18%\n* Percentage disclosed in previous report was inverted between direct & indirect suppliers and tier 1 &\n2 due to entry reversal.50%\n<1% EMEA", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2021.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
