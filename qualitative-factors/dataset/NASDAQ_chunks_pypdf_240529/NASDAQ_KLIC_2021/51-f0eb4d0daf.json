The survey allows us to assess workplace factors important to employees and address concerns raised based on their feedback. In addition, the survey results provide us with opportunities to strengthen employee engagement and scale new levels of quality, innovation and agility as \n13More information on employee benefits can be found at www.kns.com/Careers/Careers/Lifeat-K-S#Benefits\n14See page 12 for detailsIn July 2021, K&S published the first issue of the K&S Diversity Digest - a quarterly newsletter to equip ourselves with current D&I knowledge to better serve our employees, clients and communities.
