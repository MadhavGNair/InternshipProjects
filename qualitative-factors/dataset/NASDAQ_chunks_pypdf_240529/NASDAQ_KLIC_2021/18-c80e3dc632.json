In FY2018, we expanded our stakeholder \nengagement exercise to include the direct perspectives of key external stakeholders, involving Suppliers and Community \npartners in the assessment review.\nIdentified EESG topics by these stakeholders are ranked and prioritized, and eventually mapped onto a materiality matrix \nto visualize K&S\u2019 key sustainability areas. We also establish yearly targets for each topic to benchmark our performance \nprogress against to allow us to re-calibrate courses of action to achieve targets successfully if necessary. \nAll material topics are reviewed on an annual basis internally, informed by feedback garnered from the various stakeholder \nengagement mechanisms to ensure their continued relevance and significance to K&S and our stakeholders.
