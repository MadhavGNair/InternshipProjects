The revised committee comprises of leadership representatives from the four CSR pillars, supported by management leads who are responsible for driving the objectives of their respective focus areas throughout all K&S sites. An Executive Leadership Team (ELT) member provides vision and sponsorship over each of the four pillars by reviewing disclosed metrics and initiatives to meet the set goals and targets. \nEvery quarter, the sponsors assess K&S\u2019 sustainability \nperformance against set goals, reporting out to both the ELT and the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee (NGC). ESG performance and progress are also reported semi-annually to the Board of Directors (BOD) who have ultimate oversight of all K&S ESG matters.OUR  \nSUSTAINABILITY  \nGOVERNANCE  \nSTRUCTUREESG Structure at K&S\nULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY\nEXECUTIVE VISION & SPONSORSHIP\nFUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY (MANAGEMENT LEAD)PRIMARY OVERSIGHT\nEXECUTIVE OVERSIGHT\nENVIRONMENTAL\nPILLAR\nSPONSOR\n\u2022 CSR Environmental\n\u2022 Sustainability ReportingPHILANTHROPY \nPILLAR\nSPONSOR\n\u2022 CSR PhilanthropyVOLUNTEERISM\nPILLAR\nSPONSOR\n\u2022 CSR VolunteerismDIVERSITY &\nINCLUSION\nPILLAR\nSPONSOR\n\u2022 CSR D&I\n\u2022 Governance\u2022 ESG Rating AgenciesReport out quarterlyReport out quarterlyNOMINATING &\nGOVERNANCE\nCOMMITTEE \nEXECUTIVE\nLEADERSHIP\nTEAMBOARD OF\nDIRECTORS\nCHIEF\nEXECUTIVE\nOFFICER\nCSR\nSPONSORReport out semi-annually\nULTIMATE OVERSIGHT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2021.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
