We are guided by our Value-Creation Cycle model, which serves as the strategic blueprint to lead the way forward as an industry leader and deliver positive value and impact. In FY2021, we achieved a new financial milestone to report more than US$1.5 billion in annual revenue for the first time in K&S history, despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic and worldwide supply chain shortages. This is the result of a well aligned business portfolio to multiple major end-market demands in the areas of 5G, artificial intelligence, industry 4.0, electric vehicles, as well as mini and micro LED, amongst others. Within the year, we generated free cash flow of US$277.3M and achieved an operating margin of 27%.\nWe remain committed to investing strategically through our Five Layers of Growth model to meet future needs and \nuncover new opportunities that will sustain continuous growth. \nOur\nValue-Creation\nCycleAdjacent\nOpportunitiesOperational\nExcellenceMarketLeadership\nBreadth ofSolutions\nSupport\nSales &\nStrengthFinancialDevelopmentInnovation &\u2022BroadeningMarket Presence\n\u2022\nChanging MarketDynamics\n\u2022\nCompetenciesExtend to NewMarkets\u2022Empowered,AccountableOrganization\n\u2022\nKPIs Aligned \nwith\nmarket\n\u2022FlexibleManufacturing\u2022Large Installed Base\n\u2022Established Relationships\n\u2022>50% Share \nin Most Markets\n\u2022Major IC, LED &Automative Trends\n\u2022\nBroad MarketExposure\n\u2022\nIntegratedEquipment & T\nools\n\u2022>1,900 customers\n\u202275% of SalesThrough InternalSales Channels\n\u2022\nValue Added \nService\nOpportunities\u2022Operational Leverage\n\u2022Opportunistic& ConsistentShareholder Returns\n\u2022\nNew Investments\u2022Proven InternalProcess\n\u2022\nRapid Development& Commercialization\n\u2022\nProven OrganicGrowth\nAdvanced Display\u2022\nFirst Mover Advantage\n\u2022Strong Product Pipeline\n\u2022Good Customer Traction\nAssembly Complexity\u2022\nNew Value Proposition\n\u2022Fundamental Technology Shift\n\u2022Product Alignment\nAPS Opportunity\u2022\nOrganizational Alignment\n\u2022Increasing Install Base\n\u2022Broadening Portfolio\nAdjacent Opportunities\n\u2022 New Market Expan sion Opportunities\n\u2022 Leverages Core Competencies\n\u2022 Concept to Commercialization\nIndustry Acceleration\n\u2022Data Era/ 5G\n\u2022Connected Devices\n\u2022Auto Evolution", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2021.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
