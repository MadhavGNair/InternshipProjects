KPIs and goals are then set at the start of every year, and performance against goals are tracked and presented in weekly meetings and quarterly business  reviews. K&S\u2019 Quality Performance is a shared business goal across multiple functions such as Business Units, Manufacturing Operations, Global Field Service and Quality.The results are collated and shared with our Marketing and Engineering teams to develop improvement plans in the areas of concern to improve customer satisfaction. Programs are developed for processes, services and  products improvement. Employees training programs are implemented to equip K&S employees with technical and problem solving skills to better understand customer requirements and improve time to resolution.\nOur customer service does not end when the products leave our premises. We strive to provide high quality after-sales \nservice that ensures our products are constantly at peak performance. These include various K&S after-sales care programs that provide quick turnaround to meet varying levels of customers\u2019 needs, such as K&S Care, K&S Certified Repair & Refurbishment, and K&S Service Contract & Paid Service programs.\nIn the event of any issue, we adopt the Issue Escalation Flow \nsystem to manage customer feedback and issues through a structured approach to provide service recovery. An Issue Tracking System (ITS) is used to facilitate information exchange, task prioritization, and closure. To ensure that incidents do not recur, closed issues will be presented to team members during technical toolbox meetings for shared learnings and the identification of areas for improvement.\n72.4%In FY2021, \nof field issues were resolved at Escalation Level 1\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2021.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
