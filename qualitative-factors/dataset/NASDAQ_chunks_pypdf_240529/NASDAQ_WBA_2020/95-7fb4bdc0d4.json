{"page_content": "96 | Walgreens Boots Alliance  | Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2020Zero waste to landfill\n(GRI 103-2, 306-2)\nIn the fourth year of the zero waste to landfill program at Walgreens distribution centers,  \n93 percent of waste from 18 facilities in the U.S. and Puerto Rico was diverted from landfill.\nAlso in fiscal 2020, the Walgreens distribution \ncenter in Orlando, Florida diverted more than \n114,000 pounds of material from landfill. This was \npossible through a partnership with NuCycle \nEnergy that enabled the business to find \nalternative uses for mixed plastics and paper  \nthat are generally rejected by recyclers.\nFor a second year in a row, less than 1 percent \nof Boots UK waste went to landfill, with a further \nreduction in fiscal 2020, to 0.73 percent. The \nreduction in the amount of operational waste is \nlimited in scope to Boots UK owned operations \nand does not include some third-party owned \noffice locations.\nBoots UK partnered with DHL EnviroSolutions in \n2019 to conduct audits, hold existing suppliers \naccountable, provide input on potential suppliers \nand share insights about the recycling industry. \nDHL EnviroSolutions identifies opportunities to \nimprove waste processes for a variety of different \ntypes of waste and recycling including, but not \nlimited to, plastic films and pallets.\nHEALTHY PLANET", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WBA_2020.pdf", "page": 95, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
