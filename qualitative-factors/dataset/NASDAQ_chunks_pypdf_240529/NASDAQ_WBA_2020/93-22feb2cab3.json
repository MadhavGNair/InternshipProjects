{"page_content": "94 | Walgreens Boots Alliance  | Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2020Waste management is an important issue \nfor WBA and our stakeholders, who expect \nthat we do what is reasonably within our \ncontrol to avoid waste associated with our \noperations and to minimize any adverse \nimpacts of waste through responsible \nmanagement and increasing circular \neconomies. WBA continues to make our \nbusiness more sustainable by rethinking \ndesigns, reducing consumption, recycling, \ncomposting, re-using materials and global \nmeasurement of our waste generation and \ndisposal.Waste  \nand Plastics\n(GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 306-2)\nThis section of our report covers waste \nmanagement and reduction efforts, zero waste \nto landfill programs in certain areas of operation \nand efforts to reduce the negative impact of \nplastic waste in our retail stores and distribution \noperations. Our work on plastic packaging in \nour owned brands is covered in the Packaging, \nLabeling and Transparency section of this report, \nunder Sustainable Marketplace.\nWaste is a local issue and as such, it is managed \ndifferently across geographies to enhance \npositive impacts. In the UK, the government-\nbacked waste hierarchy provides a framework \nthat promotes waste avoidance, recycling and \nrecovery methods over disposal in landfill. Boots \nUK also engages environmental management \nsystems and standards to drive a culture of zero \nwaste by effectively managing all unique types of \nwaste. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) Non-Hazardous Materials and Waste \nManagement Hierarchy is used to ensure proper \napproaches are taken to different kinds of waste. \nAcross the world, WBA\u2019s businesses engage with various vendor partners to help ensure best \npractices are used when disposing of waste.\nCollaboration with and feedback from industry \ngroups is key to resolving waste issues, especially \ndue to continued uncertainties in the global \nrecycling market. Through coalitions such as the \nRetail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) in the \nU.S., Walgreens is leading efforts to increase \nrecycling and re-use in the retail industry. \nWalgreens is a member of the RILA Sustainability \nand Zero Waste Committees that promote \ncollaboration on key issues such as energy use, \ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction, waste \ngeneration reduction and the circular economy.\nAnother example of our collaboration on waste \nreduction efforts is WBA\u2019s continued sponsorship \nof the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation\u2019s \nBeyond 34: Recycling and Recovery for A \nNew Economy, which aims to improve low U.S. \nmunicipal recycling rates. In fiscal 2020, a second \ncampaign was rolled out in Cincinnati, Ohio, \nwhile the Orlando, Florida campaign continued. \nIn Cincinnati, Beyond 34 assembled a diverse \ncross-regional local champion network, inclusive \nof key local corporate, municipal, NGO and local \nchamber stakeholders. Through research and \nstakeholder engagement, potential key impact \nareas were identified and working groups formed \nto spearhead action in fiscal 2021 and beyond.\nWalgreens also supported the creation of a digital \nBeyond 34 with best practices and research \navailable to members.\nHEALTHY PLANET", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WBA_2020.pdf", "page": 93, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
