So we are \nuniquely situated to have an impact on almost \nevery community in the country. Approximately \n40 percent of our U.S. retail pharmacies serve \nareas that have been identified as either medically \nunderserved or as a healthcare professional \nshortage area for primary care, according to the \nHealth Resources & Services Administration.\nWe are centering our intensified efforts to  \naddress healthcare inequalities in Chicago, the \narea where WBA is headquartered, where life \nexpectancy is dramatically lower in African American \nand Latino or Hispanic neighborhoods compared \nwith white neighborhoods. In these neighborhoods \nof color, there is a relatively lower presence of \nhealthcare providers and health information, a higher \nprevalence of diabetes, asthma and hypertension \nand often a greater hesitancy regarding vaccinations.We\u2019re working with city leaders and \ncommunity organizations to expand \naccess to affordable care and education. \nWe are actively exploring offerings to \naddress specific health disparities across \nChicago\u2019s underserved areas, with \ninitial efforts focused in the Chatham \nneighborhood with the following services:\nDiabetes outreach \nPharmacists are prioritizing \nhigh-touch consultations for \nthose living with diabetes \nto personalize solutions, \naddress any barriers to taking \nmedications and making \nrecommendations for health \nscreenings and immunizations.\nPediatric asthma outreach \nand education  \nGiven the high prevalence of \npediatric asthma in Chicago, \npharmacists are conducting \noutreach to parents and \nguardians of children with \nasthma to provide education \non the importance and proper \nuse of asthma medications, \nreview side effects, discuss \nasthma triggers and provide \naction plans in collaboration \nwith healthcare providers,  \nas needed.\nFlu clinics  \nWe have provided flu shots \nat no cost through initiatives \nwith health insurers, the \nIllinois Department of Public \nHealth, local and state elected \nofficials, community groups  \nand churches.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WBA_2020.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
