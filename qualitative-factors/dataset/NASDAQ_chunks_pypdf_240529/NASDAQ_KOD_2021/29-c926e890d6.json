We have incorporated energy efficiency \nimprovements into the design of our new California-based R&D facility. \nThese improvements maintain the quality and safety required by our \noperations and provide important environmental benefits, including: \n \u2022 Efficient variable air volume zone flow control\n  \u2022 Exhaust air and return air handling system\n  \u2022 Laboratory exhaust air systems\n  \u2022 Efficient systems for high heat load spaces e.g., freezer rooms \n  \u2022  Reduced demand for ventilated space through natural ventilation \n  \u2022 Variable speed hot water pumping system\n  \u2022 High-efficiency hot water boilers\n  \u2022 LED lighting \n  \u2022  Lighting control system featuring occupancy sensors and \nadjustments for daylight hours\nWater  . Like many other California businesses, Kodiak understands \nwater scarcity and recognizes the importance of a clean and reliable \nwater supply. Our region relies heavily on imported water from \nsnowmelt from the Sierra Nevada mountains, and California is in the \nmiddle of a multi-year drought.\nOur Palo Alto facility allows us to incorporate the latest water-saving \nfeatures, including low water flow plumbing fixtures that also comply \nwith California Energy Code requirements.\nWaste . We also adhere to the Palo Alto city Zero Waste ordinances \nthat help the community reach its goal of virtually eliminating waste \nfrom being burned or buried. Hazardous waste, including lab waste, \nis managed by ACTenviro, ranked in the top 100 US-based recyclers \nby Waste Today, due to innovative technologies that divert material \naway from landfills.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KOD_2021.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
