This is at the core  \nof Kodiak\u2019s discovery engine. \nABC PROGRAM: OUR UNIQUE RESEARCH APPROACH\nWe are developing a common molecule to address multiple diseases. Kodiak\u2019s deepening \npipeline of mono-, bispecific and triplet inhibitors merge biologics with small molecules  \nto address major causes of vision loss beyond retinal vascular disease. \nThe ABC Platform structures water at critical binding interfaces designed to make medicines \nlast longer in the eye, thereby potentially improving their therapeutic benefit. Kodiak  \nhas leveraged its ABC Platform to build a pipeline of product candidates in various stages  \nof development including KSI-301, our anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (\u201cVEGF\u201d)  \nABC program currently in phase 3 studies, and KSI-501, our dual inhibitor antibody \nbiopolymer conjugate targeting both VEGF (VEGF-trap) and IL-6 (anti-IL-6 antibody) for  \nthe treatment of retinal diseases; currently in IND-enabling preclinical studies. We are  \nalso progressing our ABC Platform-based triplet inhibitors for multifactorial retinal diseases \nsuch as dry AMD and glaucoma.\nMONOSPECIFIC BI-SPECIFIC TRIPLET ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KOD_2021.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
