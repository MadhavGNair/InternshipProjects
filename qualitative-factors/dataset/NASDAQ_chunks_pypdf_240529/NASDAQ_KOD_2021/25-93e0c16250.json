We believe in protecting our employees in \nthese facilities from injury and illness, fire hazards, and other emergency situations. \nStarting in 2021, we began supplementing our existing efforts by implementing \nrisk-specific plans and procedures at our California-based facilities that are grounded \nin both federal and California occupational safety and health regulations and statutes.\nIn addition to these federal and state requirements, we provide prescription safety \nglasses at no cost for employees who wear glasses. We also pay for clinical testing \nto inform employees whether their HBV vaccination is still effective, in addition to \nproviding a vaccination series to lab employees who request it. \nWe conduct annual safety and laboratory training, and we require our supervisors to \ntrain their direct reports on safety procedures in their work areas.\nKodiak\u2019s goal is zero injuries.ENSURING EMPLOYEE HEALTH  \nAND SAFETY AT KODIAK \nBloodborne Pathogen  \nExposure Control Plans\nChemical Hygiene and  \nHazard Communication Plan\nInjury and Illness Prevention \nProgram\nHazardous and Medical  \nWaste Management Plan\nEmergency Action Plan\nFire Prevention PlanKODIAK HAD A TOTAL RECORDABLE INCIDENT \nRATE OF 0 IN 2021 AS DEFINED BY THE OCCUPATIONAL  \nSAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KOD_2021.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
