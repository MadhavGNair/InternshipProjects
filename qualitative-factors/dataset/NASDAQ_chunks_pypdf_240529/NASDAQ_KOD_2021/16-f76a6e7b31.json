They \nare built on a framework of collaboration and cross-functional information sharing.\nIn 2022 and 2023, we intend to have primary results from our key registrational \ntrials for our lead product candidate, KSI-301. Our plan is to use the data from these \nclinical trials, if successful, to support an initial biologics license application/marketing \nauthorization application of KSI-301 in multiple territories around the world. \nPRODUCT CANDIDATE  Pre-IND* Phase 3 Pre-clinical Phase 1A/1B\nKSI-301  \nTargeting retinal vascular disease\nIntended to improve outcomes for  \nhigh-prevalence retinal vascular diseases, \nincluding wet AMD, DME, RVO and  \nnon-proliferative DR, compared to today\u2019s \nstandard of care by targeting VEGF.\nKSI-501\nTargeting retinal vascular disease\nIntended to improve outcomes for high-\nprevalence retinal vascular diseases, such \nas AMD and DME, compared to today\u2019s \nstandard of care by targeting both VEGF as \nwell as the inflammatory mediator IL-6. For \npatients that historically do not respond \nwell to anti-VEGF alone.\nKSI-601  \nTargeting dry AMD\nIntended to address dry AMD, which could \nlead to irreversible vision loss and currently \nhas no effective treatment. Dry AMD  \naccounts for an estimated 90% of AMD cases.\nTRIPLETS  \nTargeting glaucoma\nIntended to address neurodegenerative \naspects of glaucoma, which is a leading \ncause of irreversible blindless worldwide.Our Pipeline\nKodiak has leveraged \nour ABC Platform  \nto build a pipeline of \nproduct candidates \nin various stages of \ndevelopment.\n* Pre-investigational new drugAMD = wet age-related macular degeneration \nDME = diabetic macular edema \nRVO = retinal vein occlusion \nDR = diabetic retinopathy", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KOD_2021.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
