This can enable us to work to set goals to continue reducing our environmental impact. \nWe believe that environmental considerations for a commercial-scale manufacturing operation \nwould include: \nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including air quality, pollution \nprevention and water discharges.\nReducing our GHG emissions over time by continuing to install renewable power across our \nfacilities and implement energy efficiency measures. \nOptimizing our use of shipping materials by working with shipping suppliers to optimize shipping \ncontainer size to maximize the amount of usable box space being shipped. Shipping boxes used in \nclinical trials also are becoming reusable.\nReducing waste, including hazardous and wastewater, by continuing to utilize the waste \nmanagement and recycling programs that help us with waste segregation, minimizing waste-to-\nlandfill, and identifying options to reclaim or recycle waste. \nReducing water use, particularly in water-restricted and -scarce areas and continuing to evaluate \nopportunities to reduce water usage. \nManaging chemicals used in our research and development and working towards managing \nagainst the release of chemicals into the environment. \nABOUT THIS REPORT\nKodiak Science\u2019s inaugural Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report offers an overview of the company\u2019s ESG activities, \nperformance, and strategies for the 2021 financial year.
