{"page_content": "10      KODIAK 2021 ESG REPORT BACK TO CONTENTS >>HOW WE APPROACH ESG \nAt Kodiak, we are committed to addressing stakeholder needs \nwithin every element of our company. \nAt present, our ESG priorities reflect the current risks and opportunities we face as a \nclinical stage company that seeks to complete clinical trials: \nKodiak\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and executive team collaborate to prioritize \nand oversee the company\u2019s ESG activities. The current focus is primarily on relevant \nsocial and environmental issues as the Company moves through its clinical trials. \nDespite initial disappointing phase 2b/3 trial read outs for KSI-301, we believe any \npotential successful outcomes in our additional registrational clinical trial program \nfor KSI-301 will require a move toward larger scale manufacturing and distribution. \nAs a result, we believe we will need to manage greater complexity required for global \nsales and distribution of our medicines. This will include an increasing and stage-\nappropriate focus on our ESG strategies and governance.We believe that we \nare not only building a \npotentially revolutionary \nophthalmology \ncompany but also \nengineering a new \nway to conduct \nbusiness that benefits \nemployees, partners, \nthe environment and \nshareholders alike. DRUG DEVELOPMENT \nDeveloping innovative \nophthalmology medicines  \nand producing them with  \nthe highest quality are  \nof the utmost importance  \nto Kodiak.CLINICAL TRIALS QUALITY\nThe quality of Kodiak\u2019s  \nclinical trials impacts the \nregulatory approval pathway  \nfor our product candidates.\n OUR PEOPLE\nTo build a generational \nophthalmology company,  \nKodiak needs to attract  \nand retain top-tier talent  \nacross all our functions.\nTRIAL PARTICIPANT  \nSAFETY\nWorking to ensure the safety  \nof trial participants aligns  \nwith the high standard of  \nquality Kodiak has for the rest  \nof its operations.ENVIRONMENTAL \nMANAGEMENT \nA responsible and resilient \nsupply chain and sound \nmanufacturing practices that \nconserve resources and  \nminimize wastes are \nprerequisites for high-quality \nmedicines.PREPARING FOR  \nCOMMERCIALIZATION\nWe expect that successful \ncommercialization will  \nlead to successful patient \noutcomes and returns  \nfor shareholders.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KOD_2021.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
