To better understand our current baseline, we have \nestablished working groups across our businesses to segment KLA product groups, define \nbest practice methodologies and assumptions for calculating energy consumption and \ngather more accurate data. Leveraging the SEMI S23 Guide for Conservation of Energy, \nUtilities and Materials Used by Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment , wherever \npossible we are measuring the energy consumption of our tools and components in our \nlabs rather than relying on modeling or industry averages.\nIn 2022, we are exploring a product energy efficiency strategy that aims to: 1) integrate \nefficiency metrics into product development processes, 2) generate and adopt innovation \nthat will enhance our products\u2019 energy efficiency during use, and 3) evaluate future climate \ngoals addressing Scope 3 emissions.We will continue to implement and expand upon our Supply Chain Sustainability Program \nacross the business and partner with our suppliers to minimize impact in key strategic areas \nsuch as human and labor rights, ethics, conflict minerals, inclusion and diversity and\nclimate and energy.\nIn 2022, we aim to launch a pilot program to improve our engagement with KLA's indirect \nservice providers, following RBA guidance.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2021.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
