This verification \nopinion declaration applies t o the related information included within the scope of work described below.   \nThe determination of the GHG emissions is the sole responsibility of KLA.  KLA is res ponsible for the preparat ion and \nfair pr esentation of  the GHG  emissions statement  in accordance with the criteria . Apex\u2019s  sole responsibility was to \nprovide independent verification on the accuracy of the GHG emissions reported, and on the underlying s ystems a nd \nprocesses used to collect, a nalyze and rev iew the information. Apex is responsible for expressing  an opinion on the \nGHG emissions statement  based on the verification.
