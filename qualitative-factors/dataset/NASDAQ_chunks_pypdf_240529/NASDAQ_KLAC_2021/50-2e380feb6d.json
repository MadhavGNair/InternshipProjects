To more accurately \ncalculate the environmental impact of our tools \nduring use, we established working groups across \nour businesses that completed rigorous evaluations \nusing SEMI S23 guidelines to measure total energy \nuse across the lifecycle of each product family.  \nThe results give us better insight into lifecycle \nimpacts including the provision of clean and dry \nair, nitrogen, exhaust, vacuum and ultrapure water, \ngoing beyond previous measurements focused solely \non direct electricity use. We are further improving our \ntesting cycles and processes to align with evolving \nindustry standards.Consequently, our revised carbon footprint \nmethodology measures the energy use of our \nproducts more accurately. We also fine-tuned \nenergy use estimates by using destinations for \nproduct shipments, which provides a more accurate \nrepresentation of the electricity grids in those \nlocations.\nPlease see the Products & Supply Chain : Keep \nLooking Ahead section  of this report for more \ninformation on our plans to utilize this data in 2022 \nas we work to improve product energy efficiency. \u2003", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2021.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
