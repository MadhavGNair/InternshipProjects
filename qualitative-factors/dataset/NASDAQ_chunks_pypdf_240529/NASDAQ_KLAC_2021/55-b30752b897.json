These ISO \nstandards will support the development of a \nmore systematic approach to environmental \nmanagement that will enhance data accuracy \nand consistency across the business\u2014a core EHS \nstrategic objective. \nKLA\u2019s 2022 announcement of a $1.5 billion, five-year \nsustainability-linked revolving credit facility that \nties financial performance to environmental goals \nfurther reinforces our commitment to integrating \nESG programs and goals into our core business \noperations. Our progress will be measured on \nachieving goals of increased usage of renewable \nelectricity within our operations and reduction in \nScope 1 and 2 emissions. In 2022, KLA also announced a new SBTi-informed \ntarget to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% \nby 2030 from our 2021 baseline and a target to \nachieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050.\nTo advance our efforts to address Scope 3 \nemissions, we are currently exploring a potential \nproduct energy efficiency strategy as well as a \nstrategy to engage with our top suppliers around \nsetting GHG emission reduction goals. This work \nwill inform the development of future Scope 3 \nclimate goals. \nKLA will continue to engage in ESG and climate-\nrelated industry efforts and is participating in \nseveral SEMI climate initiatives. We will also \ncontinue to work on developing additional \nreduction targets for water, energy and waste \nthroughout our own operations and will share our \nmethodologies as they are finalized. \nPlus Building on our Global HQ campus \nin Milpitas, California", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2021.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
