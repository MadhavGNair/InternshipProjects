As our cleanroom facilities expand, we will \ncontinue to incorporate sustainability principles into the \ndesign of new buildings.\nThe Ann Arbor campus, which opened in late 2021, was \ndeveloped via an end-to-end, low-impact design (LID) \napproach, prominently featuring advanced environmental \nprotection and energy efficiency. Interior highlights include \nthe widespread use of green and sustainable materials \nand low-flow plumbing fixtures. All HVAC systems, crucial \nto the success of the cleanroom, employ energy recovery \nwheels and other efficient measures. Our chilled water \nsystems were optimized to be able to turn off the chillers \nin the winter months by using the cooling towers alone.\nWe also invested in underground parking to minimize \ntree removal, as well as a green roof to improve energy \nefficiency while also removing CO2 from the atmosphere.\nGrand opening of our HQ2 campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2021.pdf", "page": 54, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
