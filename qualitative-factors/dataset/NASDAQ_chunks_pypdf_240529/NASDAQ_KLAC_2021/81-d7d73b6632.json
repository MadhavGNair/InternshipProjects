However, certain disclosures may be based on \nassumptions or estimates due to inherent measurement \nuncertainties. Standards and metrics used in preparing this \nreport, including any underlying data used in preparing \nsuch metrics, continue to evolve and are based on \nexpectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable \nat the time of preparation, but should not be considered \nguarantees. Moreover, our disclosures based on any \nstandards may change due to revisions in framework \nrequirements, availability of information, changes in our \nbusiness or applicable governmental policies, or other \nfactors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nWe also refer you to those factors discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d \nincluded in documents that we file from time to time with \nthe SEC, including KLA\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for \nthe fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, and other subsequent \nfilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(including, but not limited to, the risk factors described \ntherein).

We do not have, and expressly disclaim, \nany obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or \nevents that arise after the date the forward-looking \nstatements were made. This report also contains matters \nthat may be significant, however, any significance should \nnot be read as necessarily rising to the level of materiality \nused for the purposes of complying with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws, even if we use the word \u201cmaterial\u201d or \n\u201cmateriality\u201d in this report. Given the uncertainties and \nassumptions required to make some of the disclosures \nin this report, and the timelines involved, materiality is \ninherently difficult to assess far in advance. Moreover, \ngiven the inherent uncertainty of the estimates, \nassumptions and timelines contained in this report, we \nmay not be able to anticipate whether or the degree to \nwhich we will or will not be able to meet our plans, targets \nor goals in advance.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2021.pdf", "page": 81, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
