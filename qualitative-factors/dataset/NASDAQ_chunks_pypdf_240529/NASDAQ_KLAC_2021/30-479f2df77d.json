Over the past \nyear, our Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) \nteam focused on building its organization to \nincrease global coordination and consistency \nwith strong local connections that support \ncustomers and employees within each \nregion and site. Under the leadership of a \ndedicated global EHS Director overseeing an \nincreasingly robust set of programs, the team \ncontinued to grow in 2021, adding new hires \nin Europe, Asia and the U.S., and will expand \nfurther in 2022.\nIn 2021, the continuing demands of COVID-19 \nrequired that we build upon our global \napproach to EHS with strong collaboration \nacross the regions. This has resulted in the \nadoption of best practices for each of our \nsites, improving business resiliency and \nthe health and safety of our employees \nworldwide. In addition, our flexible work \noptions have enabled employees to remain \nsafely at home during quarantines to \nsupport their families and prevent cross-\ncontamination in the workplace.Our goal is always zero accidents across our \nfacilities. To achieve that, we conduct\nproactive risk assessments and audits to \nconstantly improve our efforts. We implemented \na global standard for tracking and reporting \nour incidents to ensure consistency across our \nregions, and continually outperform industry \naverages for injury rates. In 2021, our U.S. Total \nRecordable Incident Rate was 0.22.\nWe set a goal to globalize our ISO 45001 \n(Occupational Health & Safety Management \nSystems, or OH&S) certification and expand our \nISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems, \nor EMS) certification beyond our larger sites. Our \ngoal is to have one integrated ISO 14001/45001 \nsystem and certify our main production and R&D \nfacilities under one global certificate that meets \nISO\u2019s stringent requirements. We plan to execute \nthese plans over the course of 2022-2024.Setting a High Bar \nfor Safety\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2021.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
