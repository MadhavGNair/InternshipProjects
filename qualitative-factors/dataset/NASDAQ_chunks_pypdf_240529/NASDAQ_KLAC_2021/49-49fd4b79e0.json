The increase was primarily due to \nthe addition of more complete data from \nour SPTS and Orbotech division sites that \nwas not available in prior years. \nOther factors included improved data \ndetail, availability, and category revisions of \nleased properties, which resulted in a more \naccurate representation of energy use in \nthose facilities. We also obtained more \nrobust data on mobile emissions sources. \nAs Scope 3 comprises the vast majority \nof our emissions, we continue to improve \nupon our data collection, analysis and \nestimation methodologies. Emissions \nresulting from business travel (Scope \n3) were 10,789 tons (MTCO2e) in 2021, \ncompared with 11,548 tons in 2020. \nOne reason for the decrease is because \nbusiness travel was still very limited in \n2021, and the 2020 figure includes \u2018pre-\npandemic\u2019 travel in early 2020, which was \nat a much higher rate.

However even with \nthe additional data sources for business \ntravel, the pandemic has continued to \naffect corporate travel worldwide which \nalso impacts GHG emissions. \nEmployee commute emissions increased \nsignificantly due to employees returning to \nwork sites and the inclusion of employee \nwork-from-home emissions that were not \nestimated during 2020.\nDue to these factors and other \nmethodology changes, an accurate year-\non-year comparison is not applicable, \nso we have visually presented only 2021 \ndata in the charts shown here. We intend \nto present year-on-year performance \nin future reports.
