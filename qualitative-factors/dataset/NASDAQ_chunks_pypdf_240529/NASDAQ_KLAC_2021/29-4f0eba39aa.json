The program utilizes a paper microscope invented \nby two Stanford students and marketed under the Foldscope \nname, that magnifies up to 140 times of what can be seen by the human eye and has a 2-micron resolution. At only $1 \neach to manufacture, the low cost ensures that all students \nwho participate can have their own microscope.
