In 2020 and \n2021, we partnered with a third-party \nconsultant to build upon this assessment \nand inform our corporate strategy and \nESG reporting. The process was guided \nby the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \nReporting Principles. We used GRI\u2019s \ndefinition of materiality to identify and \nassess priority topics across the value \nchain that our stakeholders care most \nabout, are of greatest relevance to our \nbusiness and align with our purpose to \nadvance humanity through the power of \ntechnology. \nWe also considered the Sustainability \nAccounting Standards Board \n(SASB) Conceptual Framework and \nsemiconductor industry standard to Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) \nMateriality Assessment \nidentify topics for inclusion in the \nassessment.\nThe 2020 ESG materiality assessment \nincluded a detailed review of industry \ntrends, best practices and standards, \ninvestor assessments, and benchmarking \nof peers and industry leaders. We \nalso engaged our executive team and \ninvestors through interviews and our \nemployees through a companywide \nsurvey and focus group discussions. \nCollecting the perspectives from a range \nof KLA stakeholders helped us develop \na robust ESG strategy that capitalizes \non our biggest opportunities, increases \npositive impact and business growth, \nand addresses areas of risk, such as \noperating in a carbon-constrained world. \nThe results of the assessment (see \nmatrix) were reviewed by our ESG \nSteering Committee, which is comprised \nof KLA leaders who oversee our strategy \nunder the guidance of our Board of \nDirectors.
