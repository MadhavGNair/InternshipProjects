TTM Technologies, a global manufacturer of printed circuit \nboards and radio frequency components and assemblies, \nselected Orbotech Neos 800 to apply solder masks to \nprinted circuit boards more sustainably and at a lower \ncost. After rigorous testing, qualification and installation, the global manufacturer was able to cut their solder mask \nsequence in half, reduce chemical waste, and accelerate \ntheir manufacturing process. TTM\u2019s global Printed Circuit \nBoard (PCB) customers include leaders in aerospace, \ndefense, automotive, computing and medicine.\n\u201cThe Orbotech Neos enables us \nto increase our productivity in a \nsmaller footprint on the factory \nfloor. This high-speed solution \nis 100% additive with no mess, \nless power, fewer chemicals, and \nsubstantial material savings.\u201d \nPhil Titterton\nChief Operating Officer, TTM Technologies\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2021.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
