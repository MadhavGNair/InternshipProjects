We have \na number of programs in place to ensure our employees can remain and \ngrow within our organization. \nIn 2021, we performed a mid-year salary review and made adjustments to \nensure we were competitive with others in the market. We reshaped long-\nterm incentives for employees to share in KLA\u2019s success through restricted \nstock units (RSUs). We expanded hybrid work options and telecommuting. \nWe made improvements to our interviewing process, reducing the time to \nrecruit new employees. And we worked to broaden and diversify the talent \npool by looking at adjacent skills and developing employees after they \nonboard at KLA.Talent Attraction & Retention \nEmployees at KLA are encouraged to chart a career path that is most \nmeaningful to them.
