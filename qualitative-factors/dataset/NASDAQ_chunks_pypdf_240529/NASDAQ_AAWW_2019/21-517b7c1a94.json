{"page_content": "ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE   2018-2019 ESG Report  |   22 Corporate Governance\nSince our 2019 annual meeting, several Board changes have \noccurred. In August 2019, our independent Chairman, Robert \nF. Agnew, passed away. Subsequently, our President and CEO \nWilliam J. Flynn was elected Chairman of the Board, and Board \nmember and retired U.S. Air Force General Duncan J. McNabb \nwas named our Lead Independent Director. In addition, in \nJuly 2019, the company announced a leadership transition \nunder which John W. Dietrich, former Executive Vice President \nand Chief Operating Officer, became President, effective \nimmediately, while maintaining his role as Chief Operating \nOfficer. Mr. Dietrich will assume the role of President and Chief \nExecutive Officer effective January 1, 2020, when Mr. Flynn \nretires as an active employee. Mr. Flynn will retain his role as \nChairman of the Board.\nBoard Refreshment and Diversity\nWe endorse the concept of Board and Committee \nrefreshment, which has resulted in the election of five new \nBoard members over the last three years and the rotation \nof the Chairman of the Board and the Chairs of our three \nstanding Committees over the last three years. \nIn 2018 specifically, we added two gender-diverse (including \none ethnically diverse) Board members and amended the \nNominating and Governance Committee charter to provide \nthat diversity should be a factor in assessing the Board\u2019s \ncore competencies as a whole. We also moved to proactively \nprevent potential over-boarding issues by amending our \nCorporate Governance Principles to limit Directors to serving \non a maximum of four public-company boards (including the \nAtlas Air Worldwide Board).Shareholder Engagement Efforts\nIn order to effectively address the evolving \nexpectations of our shareholder base and \nthe broader investment community, we \nremain focused on frequent and extensive \nshareholder engagement. Our outreach \nprogram generally targets shareholders \nrepresenting approximately 75% of our \noutstanding shares, and we have generally \nheld discussions with shareholders \nrepresenting well in excess of 50% of \nour outstanding shares. Key topics of \ndiscussion have included our corporate \ngovernance, sustainability and executive \ncompensation practices, as well as our \nbusiness strategy and performance, capital \nallocation strategy and public disclosures. \nAs a result of specific feedback from \nshareholders, we have made numerous \nsubstantive changes to our compensation \nprogram, practices and disclosures, as well \nas to our governance practices.\nBoard Diversity*\n33%  \u2013 3 out of 9 Board members are female\n55%  \u2013 5 out of 9 Board members are diverse  \n(including gender and ethnicity)\n* data points as of September 1, 2019 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAWW_2019.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
