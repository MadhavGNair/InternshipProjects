{"page_content": "ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE   2018-2019 ESG Report  |   27Data Privacy and Cybersecurity\nThreat Detection and Response\nIn cybersecurity specifically, we know that new \npotential threats emerge every day. With strong \nsupport from the Board and our executives, Atlas \nseeks out and responds to vulnerabilities on a \ncontinuous basis. We maintain compliance with the \nNIST 800-171 cybersecurity framework standard, \nwhich requires robust maintenance processes to \nensure systems and networks remain at the highest \nlevel of known protection. In fact, we were the first \nmember of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to declare \ncompliance with the NIST standard, which is required \nof defense contractors. \nOur many programs of threat awareness feed \ninto responsive processes designed to remediate \nexposures before they become an issue, or to respond \nin a programmatic and professional manner if they \ndo. This includes ensuring that sensitive data are \nsubject to additional management requirements \nto guard against tampering or exfiltration. We also \nmaintain a multiyear roadmap of projects designed \nto continuously evolve and strengthen the security \naround sensitive data and cyber resiliency. \nProviding Leadership and Support  \nfor the Industry\nAcross the air cargo industry, Atlas is a recognized \nleader and innovator in cybersecurity and data privacy. \nExamples include:\n\u25ca Participating in leadership roles in a number of \nglobal cybersecurity organizations , including \nthe Aviation Information Sharing & Analysis \nCenter  (A-ISAC), which serves as a focal point for \nsecurity information sharing across the aviation \nsector and the Defense Industrial Base of the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD). \n\u25ca Chairing the Air Transport cybersecurity \ncommittee  (by our senior vice president \nof information technology) of the National \nDefense Transportation Association (NDTA), a \ncollaboration between transportation carriers \nand the U.S. Transportation Command, one of 11 \nunified commands under the DOD. \nLeading the Way with Training  \nand Drills \nFor information security to be effective, we \nbelieve it must be a team effort involving the \nparticipation and support of every employee. \nCybersecurity training and awareness are part \nof our new-employee orientation program, \nand we regularly conduct fake \u201cphishing\u201d \ncampaigns to ensure that employees maintain \na high level of vigilance. On occasion, we have \ncontracted with independent \u201cwhite hat\u201d \nhackers to further validate the security of  \nour systems. \nIn addition to the employee training, Atlas \nconducts tabletop exercises and drills \nthroughout the year. In 2018, more than 20 \ndepartments participated in exercises to \npractice and refine their operating procedures. \nWe share the insights from our training and \ndrills with our partners in the private sector \nand the FAA and DOD and have been asked  \nto help lead sector-based exercises for the \nairline industry.\u25ca Working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) to deliver training for other organizations on \npreventing and responding to cyberattacks. We also \nrecently reached a cooperative R&D agreement for threat \ninformation systems with DHS. \n\u25ca Working with partners such as Boeing and the Federal \nAviation Administration  on software management and \nsystem security for the Boeing 747-8, one of the most \nadvanced and successful commercial and passenger \naircraft in the world.
