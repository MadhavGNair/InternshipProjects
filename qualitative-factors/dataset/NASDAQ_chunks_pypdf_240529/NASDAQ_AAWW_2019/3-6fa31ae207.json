This includes our commitment to be an \nindustry leader in addressing aircraft fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \nToday, Atlas operates the world\u2019s largest fleet of Boeing 747 freighters. Growth is important to us, and so is being a \nresponsible corporate citizen. Our goal is to deliver tangible impact on issues that matter and also influence others in our \nindustry and value chain to do so as well. \nWith the guidance of our internal ESG executive committee, we have established our ESG policy and made meaningful \nprogress in enhancing and coordinating our many ESG-related efforts.
