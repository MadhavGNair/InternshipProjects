Grassroots initiatives are a \nsignificant driver of our efforts. Consider the example of the team \nat Polar Air Cargo, an Atlas Air Worldwide company, working at \nAnchorage International Airport in Alaska. \nThe team in Anchorage identified that a significant amount \nof waste was being generated from discarding oil cans used \nin aircraft and truck maintenance. The employees launched a \nprogram to collect and recycle these cans \u2013 but they didn\u2019t stop there. Employees engaged with \nPolar vendors and partners at the airport to facilitate the collection and recycling of their cans as \nwell and to have all of them sent to a local recycling center. Since starting the program in June 2019, \nPolar employees have helped recycled 500 cans every two weeks.\nThis waste reduction program in Anchorage is part of Polar\u2019s broader sustainability initiative \ncalled Project Greening. Launched in 2019, Project Greening, under the slogan \u201cLess Waste, Better \nFuture,\u201d is intended to engage Polar employees in problem-solving and action around environmental \nconcerns. The initial focus is on addressing \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d such as waste reduction, energy \nmanagement for facilities and equipment, and office materials recycling, with a longer-term \nintention to work on a variety of ESG-related issues.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAWW_2019.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
