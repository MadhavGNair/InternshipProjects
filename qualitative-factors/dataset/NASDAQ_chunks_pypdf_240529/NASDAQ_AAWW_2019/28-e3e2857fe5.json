{"page_content": "ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE   2018-2019 ESG Report  |   29Our ESG Stories\nAtlas Commits to  \nCORSIA Carbon Emissions Reduction Program \nAtlas Air Worldwide is committed to effective global implementation of the Carbon Offsetting \nand Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) program established by the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\nICAO\u2019s aim for CORSIA, which we support, is to secure a broad-based international civil aviation \ncommitment to zero net CO2 emissions growth starting in 2021. By adopting CORSIA, the \ninternational aviation community also has agreed to reduce its net CO2 emissions by 50% by \n2050, compared with a 2005 baseline. We and other airlines will contribute to meeting those \ngoals by tapping into existing carbon markets to implement an offset program. \nAtlas has voluntarily begun tracking and will begin reporting emissions in accordance with \nCORSIA methodology in 2020, even though it will not yet be mandatory in ICAO member \ncountries. We believe this leadership position is good for the environment and good for our \nbusiness. While the data will be verified by an independent third party, the program overall will \nbe self-policing \u2013 therefore, we expect to be a strong voice in the industry for maintaining a \nculture of transparency and compliance.   \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAWW_2019.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
