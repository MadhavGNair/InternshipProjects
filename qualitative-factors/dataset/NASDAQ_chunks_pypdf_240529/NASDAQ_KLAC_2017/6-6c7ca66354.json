All crates incoming to KLA-Tencor are \ndiverted from landfills by being either reused or \nrecycled into other products. KLA-Tencor prohibits \nthe use of fumigation via methyl bromide for all \nwood packaging materials since methyl bromide \nis toxic to humans and depletes the ozone layer. \nHeat treatment is the only approved fumigation \nmethod that complies with International Standards \nfor Phytosanitary Measures No. 15.  KLA-Tencor\u2019s primary crating vendor implemented \nsolar power in 2015 and has a material diversion \nrate of greater than 90 percent. The vendor \nalso sources raw wood materials that comply \nwith established sustainability programs such \nas the Forest Stewardship\u2122 (FSC)\u00ae, Sustainable \nForestry Initiative\u00ae (SFI\u00ae) and the Programme for \nthe Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) \nstandards. These certifications ensure the wood \nutilized is harvested legally, and that forests are \nmanaged and replenished while maintaining \nbiodiversity.  KLA-Tencor CSR 2017\nPackaging engineers at KLA-Tencor focus on \ndesigning packages that protect products while \nreducing KLA-Tencor\u2019s environmental impact. \nBy considering the entire life cycle of a product, \nreusable cases or crates are designed for repairable \nand returnable high value components, and are \nused for the life of the product, as opposed to the \nconventional single-use packaging methodology. \nThe KLA-Tencor packaging engineer design \nparadigm incorporates material reduction by \ncreating shipping containers that are tailored to \nthe size of the product and are made of recyclable materials wherever possible. For example, a \nrecently developed retention pack design reduces \nthe amount of foam in the container by up to 80 \npercent, is more easily recyclable since it does not \nrequire glue, and can be used on a wide range of \nparts. Materials & Packaging\nThe KLA-Tencor Packaging Engineering Team continues to make strides \nin reducing the company\u2019s environmental impact. Since 2006, KLA-\nTencor has prohibited the use of bleached corrugated boxes, polystyrene \nloose fill, and, since 2012, foam-in-place materials.\nCorporate Packaging CY15 CY16 CY17\nUnited States - New Designs added to RRR program 9 7\nUnited States - Crate Reuse Rate 89% 73% 72%\nSingapore - New Designs added to RRR program  7 9\nSingapore- Crate Reuse Rate 24% 31% 26%\nGlobal - New Reusable Cases Implemented 11 6 15\nNote: Materials not reused in the above rates are recycled.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2017.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
