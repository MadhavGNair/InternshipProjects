{"page_content": "Page 15 Page 14Transport KLA-Tencor CSR 2017\nTransport\nThe KLA-Tencor environmentally friendly transportation \nprogram focuses on optimizing cargo space for all shipments by \ndesigning shipping materials tailored to the size of the specific \nequipment rather than defaulting to a one-size-fits-all approach.\nThe use of tailored shipping containers \navoids defaulting to larger containers than \nneeded, wasting materials and space in \nshipments.\nBy pioneering the use of collapsible crates, KLA-\nTencor ships empty crates at approximately \nhalf the volume of the full crate. Our half-\nsize collapsible crates can be shipped by air \nusing standard freight aircraft rather than \njumbo freighters, thereby saving on fuel cost \nand allowing carriers to optimize fuel-to-load \nparameters. This practice helps to minimize the overall transportation impacts for reshipping, \nredeployment, and return of systems in the field \nthat need to be moved to a new location. \nIn addition, KLA-Tencor has been at the \nforefront of encouraging employees to utilize \ndigital technology to reduce the need for travel \nboth locally and globally. Many of our facilities \nare equipped with HDTV video conferencing \ncapabilities to provide a more environmentally \nresponsible alternative and mitigate the need for \nemployee travel.\nNew shipping process reduces costs and shipment footprint by better organizing materials and making parts easier to access", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2017.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
