In my three-year tenure, I \nhave not once had to pretend \nto be someone I\u2019m not. My \nidentity isn\u2019t a checkmark in a \nbox here, and I love that I can \nlearn from and interact with so \nmany unique individuals.\"\nCONNOR SOIKES, \nSLEEP PROFESSIONAL\nSleep Number\u00ae setting 45\n\u201cWhen you are part of multiple \nmarginalized groups, corporate \nAmerica can be intimidating. \nIn recent years, the focus at \nSleep Number has been on \nallowing everyone to bring their \nbest selves to the table. I have \nbeen part of so many changes \nwithin the organization \u2014 from \nhard conversations to updated \npolicies. I have never felt this \nstrong sense of belonging with \nany other company.\u201d  \nJESSICA STEHOUWER, \nSTORE MANAGER \nSleep Number\u00ae setting 25While Sleep Number has embraced a culture of individuality for decades, \nwe have intensified our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion \n(DEI) and accelerated implementation of initiatives within our strategy. \nOur Board of Directors, CEO and Senior Leadership Team set the \ntone, modeling inclusive behaviors and attitudes, investing in tailored \nintercultural training and consistently reinforcing its importance to the \nbroader organization.
