Homeowners \ncan manage their SunVault energy storage with \nthe mySunPower\u00ae app to see how much energy \nis available during peak-demand, reserve for an \noutage or lower energy costs by using stored \nenergy. Further, all SunVault energy storage \nsystems are backed by a 10-year warranty, \nregardless of how much the battery is charged and \ndrained over time.\nSunPower is expanding its portfolio of energy \nstorage products with the launch of a 19.5 kWh and \n39 kWh SunVault. With the introduction of 19.5 and \na 39 kWh versions, SunVault can be right-sized for \nalmost any home with modularity and scale. These new battery configurations offer increased energy \ndensity and maximize space within the battery \nas compared to previous versions of SunVault, \nproviding the ability to store more energy into a \nsingle box. For customers, this means they can \npurchase more energy storage for less money and \nfit it in less wall space, with the option to build a \nlarger system as the home\u2019s energy needs evolve. \nSunPower has also made design upgrades that can \nmake SunVault faster and easier to install. \nIn all, SunVault is now available in four \nconfigurations: 13 kWh, 19.5 kWh, 26 kWh, and \n39 kWh.
