{"page_content": "Starbucks Global Responsibility Report  \u2013 Goals and Progress 2011\n16Green Building  \nWith more than 17,000 retail locations around the world, we\u2019re intently focused on green building initiatives to help us \nreach our environmental targets and deliver long-term environmental impact and operating cost reductions. Now we are \nbuilding our new company-owned stores to achieve LEED\u00ae (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification \nby the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).\nStarbucks joined the USGBC in 2001 and partnered with them to develop the LEED for Retail program, an effort to adapt \nLEED to new construction and commercial interior strategies for retail businesses. We opened our first LEED\u00ae-certified \nstore in 2005, and in 2009, Starbucks became one of the first retailers to join USGBC\u2019s LEED Volume Certification  pilot \nprogram. We executed ten successful store design and construction projects in six different bio-regions \u2013 all audited  \nand approved by the USGBC. We are using the knowledge gained from these pilots in our broader LEED program. \nOur goal is to build all new company-owned stores to achieve LEED certification \u2013 and in fiscal year 2011 75 percent were \nbuilt to achieve this standard in 121 of 161 new company-owned stores. As the first retail company to take this building \napproach globally, we are learning how to manage the complexities of the program throughout the entire course of \nbuilding and certification. We will continue to work to address specific challenges that prevent some geographic  \nareas from meeting LEED requirements, and to improve the tracking and certification process. \nInside our LEED certified stores, customers will find repurposed, recycled and locally sourced elements, as well as \ninnovative environmental features. Our LEED certified stores generate  60 percent less construction waste and require less \nwater and energy to operate. On average, our LEED certified stores achieve a 30 percent reduction in energy used for \nlighting and 60 percent reduction in water use against the LEED baseline.  In 2011 we were recognized for our leadership \nin green building with the Sustainable Design Award from Global Green USA .\nWhile our LEED program addresses new company-owned stores, we\u2019re proactively looking for opportunities to leverage \nenvironmental design practices in all of our stores. With more than 80 LEED accredited professionals on our global store \ndevelopment team, we\u2019re also working to provide licensees and other business partners with guidance on sustainable \ndesign and construction practices.\nGOALS PROGRESS\nInfrastructureCollectionDesign\nMODIFIED GOAL\n*U.S., Canada, U.K. and Ireland company-owned stores.\n**US, Canada, UK, Ireland and Germany.ON TRACKON TRACK\nON TRACKChiapas, MexicoSumatra, \nIndonesia\n(Pilot)Farmers participating - 150\n23,357 tons of carbon soldForest protected - 210,258 hectares\nGOALS PROGRESS\nON TRACK\nGOALS PROGRESS\nGOALS PROGRESS\n(lb)\n(lb)(kg)(kg)Total coffee purchases\n(in millions)\nTotal C.A.F .E.

We continued to learn from our \npilot in Indonesia and have seen signi\ufb01cant improvements with the program\u2019s implementation  \nin Mexico.\nDuring this \ufb01rst year of \nimplementation, we built 75% of our new company-owned stores to achieve LEED certi\ufb01cation.We made nearly $14.7 million \nin loan commitments to our \ncurrent loan partners in 2011 while exploring innovative and new opportunities.\nWe more than doubled our \ncommunity service hours \nfrom 2010. 86% of our coffee was \nethically sourced under C.A.F.E.
