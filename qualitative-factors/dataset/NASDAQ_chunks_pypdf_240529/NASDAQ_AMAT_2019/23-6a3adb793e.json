This figure represents energy from \nutility renewable energy programs, on-site generation, and \nour purchase of RECs.\nIn April 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s \nGreen Power Partnership ranked Applied Materials as a \ntop-100 user of green power in the U.S., recognizing our \nleading purchases of renewable energy. The Green Power \nPartnership is a voluntary initiative of over 1,500 partners \nworking together to advance the U.S. market for green \npower and related developments. Applied is also ranked \n19 on the partnership\u2019s T op 30 T ech & T elecom list and 34 \namong Green Power Partners on the Fortune 500\u00ae list.
