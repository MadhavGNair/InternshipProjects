{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 201930Water Performance \nWithdrawal: In 2019, our total water withdrawal grew as \na result of increased production, in addition to increased \nfacility footprint in Asia, the U.S., and other regions. \nA portion of the increased consumption may also be \nattributed to warmer temperatures, requiring increased \ncooling.\nWater Sources: Applied Materials obtains its water from \nlocal, municipal-supplied facilities in the cities or counties \nwhere we operate. Except for our facilities in T reviso, Italy, \nand Birch Grove, Montana, we do not directly withdraw water from sources such as wells, lakes, or rivers. No \nnative water sources are affected by withdrawal or water \nreclamation processes or drainage. \nWater Stress Risk: Applied Materials uses the World \nResources Institute\u2019s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to \nidentify areas around the world that experience water \nstress, which could lead to water-related risks. In 2019, \n13.95% of our water withdrawal was from extremely high \nwater-stressed areas. Overall, our California R&D facility \nis our most significant facility located in areas considered \nwater-stressed.\nExtreme drought conditions in California and T exas \nhave led to water usage restrictions and reductions, and \nCalifornia is in the process of assessing and implementing \nwater reductions for businesses. Preparing for potential \nwater mandates, our facilities in both states are working \nto gauge potential business impact and additional \nopportunities to reduce their water consumption.CY2019 \nT otal Water Withdrawal  1,798 \nCity Water Purchased 1,780\nGround Water 18\nLocations Water Stress Risk Megaliters %\nRehovot Extremely High (>80%) 57 3%\nXi\u2019an Extremely High (>80%) 206 12%\nBangalore Extremely High (>80%) 1 0%\nHeimstetten High (40-80%) 1 0%\nT reviso Medium - High (20-40%) 19 1%\nNewburyport Medium - High (20-40%) 1 0%\nGloucester Medium - High (20-40%) 33 2%\nKorea (Hwaseong & Pyeongtaek) Medium - High (20-40%) 6 0%\nAlzenau Low - Medium (10-20%) 18 1%\nKalispell Low - Medium (10-20%) 14 1%\nAustin Low - Medium (10-20%) 115 6%\nSanta Clara Low (<10) 256 14%\nSunnyvale Low (<10) 940 53%\nT ainan Low (<10) 57 3%\nSingapore Low (<10) 57 3%\nTOTAL (Manufacturing\tSites\tOnly) 1,779 100%2019 WRI Aqueduct Water RiskWater Data  \n(megaliters)Environmental Health & Safety", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2019.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
