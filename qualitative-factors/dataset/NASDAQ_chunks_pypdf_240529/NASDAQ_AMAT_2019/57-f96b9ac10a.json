In this program, eight \ncandidates rotated through three placements of \nsix months a piece, and two MBA graduates went \nthrough two rotations.\n\u2022 In the U.S., our university recruiting team \ncontinued its long partnership with the \nLeadership Encouraging Achievement through \nDiversity (LEAD) / Black Employee Network \n(BEN) to recruit outstanding talent from North \nCarolina A&T, ranked number-one among public \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities \n(HBCUs).\n\u2022 In Silicon Valley and Austin, we partnered \nwith several of Applied\u2019s Employee Resource \nGroups (ERGs) to bring local female and \nunderrepresented minority students to our \ncampuses and potentially into our workforce, \nresulting in several new hires for both the U.S. \ninternship and NCG programs.\u2022 In China, our first large-scale NCG program in \nthe country since 2000 resulted in recruitment \nof nearly 60 graduates. As part of this New Star \nprogram, we conducted interviews at 39 top \nuniversities. T wenty-one percent of these new \nhires hold a Master\u2019s or Doctoral degree and \n14% are female. The reinvigorated program is \nenhancing our operations in a vitally important \nregion for the company.\n\u2022 The Santa Clara chapter of our Y oung \nProfessionals Network ERG served as editors for \nstudents in the Stanford RISE Internship Program, \na seven-week summer program for high school \nstudents interested in STEM topics. Many of the \nstudents are first-generation college-bound. \nOther U.S. outreach efforts in 2019 included Silver \nSponsorship of the Math, Engineering and Science \nAchievement (MESA) Student Leadership Conference \nin Sacramento, CA, as well as sponsoring and \nattending:\n\u2022 The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) \nEvening with Industry dinners at universities \nincluding California State Polytechnic  \nand Cornell\n\u2022 The University of California, Los Angeles \n(UCLA) Center for Excellence in Engineering \nand Diversity (CEED) Networking and \nProfessional Etiquette Roundtable\n\u2022 The Georgia T ech Women in Materials Science \nNetworking Dinner\n\u2022 The Out for Undergrad (LGBTQ)  \nEngineering Conference\nMore information about Applied Materials\u2019 support for \nSTEM education can be found under Operationalizing \nInclusion in All We Do and Community Impact.\nOur People & Workplace", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2019.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
