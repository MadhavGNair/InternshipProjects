Our portfolio of \ninnovative equipment, services, and software products makes possible \nthe fabrication of semiconductor chips, flat panel displays, solar \nphotovoltaic cells, and flexible electronics. Our solutions help produce \nvirtually every semiconductor chip and flat-panel display in the world. \nAs demand for digital services increases, so too does the \ndemand for the devices our products help manufacture. \nWith datacenters now consuming about 2% of the world\u2019s \nelectricity, we are committed to being part of the solution \n\u2013 enabling groundbreaking innovations in compute \nefficiency and accelerating the technologies needed \nto solve the world\u2019s greatest environmental and social \nchallenges.\nRecent advances are already driving significant \nimprovements in compute performance per watt, and our \ncompany and industry are rich with innovators taking it \nfurther. When those innovations scale up, as they will, \nthe applications and possibilities will be endless, giving \nus the analytical and predictive capabilities to accelerate \nresearch and surface previously unimagined solutions.\nThat\u2019s our product responsibility vision on a grand  \nscale, but it starts with the incremental steps needed  \nto get there. In 2019, we made significant progress on a number of \nprocess and policy fronts:\nThis section of the report details those and other \nefforts that help manage and minimize our products\u2019 \nenvironmental, health, and safety impacts, improving the \nESG footprint of Applied, our customers, and technology \nusers worldwide.\nEconomy and efficiency have always been the name of the \ngame \u2013 and we\u2019re getting a lot better. 2019 Progress\n\u2022 Modified our product design process to \nincorporate ESG criteria from the very \nearliest stages\n\u2022 Instituted explicit design targets for all \nnew Applied products, covering energy \nand water usage and other environmental \nmetrics \n\u2022 Adopted a system to monitor product \nsustainability metrics and  included \nsustainability metrics in product \nscorecards\nIn March 2020, Applied Materials was \namong the companies honored with \nIntel\u2019s 2019 Preferred Quality Supplier \nAward, which recognizes partners \ndeeply committed to excellence and \nprofessionalism.\nA Focus on Innovation", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2019.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
