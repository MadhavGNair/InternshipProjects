It brings new perspectives \nand capabilities to further innovation, reduces social \ninequality by supporting job creation and economic  \ngrowth in diverse communities, promotes resilience,  \nand drives competition that can reduce supply chain  \ncosts by up to 33%.1 \nIn 2017, Applied Materials established a supplier  \ndiversity program to make our supply chain progressively \nmore inclusive and equitable. In 2018, the program was \nexpanded to cover all U.S. operations. That same year, \nwe co-founded the Manufacturing Ownership Diversity \nWorking Group (MOD), a supplier diversity alliance with \nmembers from across the semiconductor industry.Our Supplier Diversity program tracks the segmentation of \nour diverse supplier spend for our U.S.-based operations. \nLooking ahead, we plan to boost our total year-over-year \nsupplier diversity spend, establish growth goals to ensure \nan even larger future role for diversity in our supply chain, \nand further improve supplier diversity disclosure and \ntransparency. \nRead our Supply Chain Diversity Statement here.
