{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 201922Emissions Data\nThrough efforts to increase efficiency, resource \nconservation, and greater use of renewable energy, \nApplied Materials remains focused on maximizing \nenergy performance and minimizing consumption. In \nrecent years, despite rapid operational growth, we have \nsucceeded in keeping our energy use and GHG emissions \nrelatively flat through a combination of:\n\u2022 Routine energy-use monitoring and  \nenergy audits\n\u2022 Optimizing the temperature of water used  \nin our operations\n\u2022 Building optimal energy efficiency into  \nall new construction\n\u2022 Purchasing only the most energy-efficient  \nnew equipment\n\u2022 Employing emissions-control technologies\n\u2022 Increasing our focus on clean, renewable energy\nWe have identified Scope 2 electricity consumption as \nhaving the greatest potential impact on achieving our \nstated energy and emissions targets. Looking forward, we \nanticipate our Scope 3 emissions to be much higher than \nScope 1 and 2 combined. T o date, we have not yet set a \nScope 3 emissions reduction target, but will do so as part \nof our commitment to setting science-based targets.\nAfter experiencing a total annual carbon reduction of just \n0.2% in 2017, we set a year-over-year GHG emissions \nreduction target of 1% for 2019 over 2018. We met and \nbeat this target, achieving a 4% emissions reduction.\nAir emissions from our manufacturing processes are \ntreated with point-of-use abatement units and facility \nscrubbers before being discharged to the atmosphere, \nconsistent with our local or regional air permits \nrequirements.2019 2018 2017\n Scope 1Process\tGas 18.2 14.2 13.5\nRefrigerant 1.7 1.3 0.8\nNatural\tGas 22.4 23 22.1\nT otal  \nScope 142.2 38.5 36.5\nScope 2 Electricity 103.1 113.5 131.6\nScope 1 + Scope 2 145.4 151.9 168.1\nScope 3 (Employee Travel) 30.0 35.9 17.3\nGHG Emissions Intensity\ntCO2-e of total Scope 1  \n& Scope 2 per employee  6.26  6.79  8.44 \ntCO2-e of total Scope 1 \n& Scope 2 per million \ndollars of revenue 9.95  9.10  11.44 \nEnergy Intensity\nMWh of energy \nconsumed per employee 16.86  16.52 17.52\nMWh of energy \nconsumed per million \ndollars of revenue 26.82  22.14  23.73 GHG Emissions Data  \n(in\tthousand\ttCO2-e)Climate Change", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2019.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
