Ensuring Safe Work Environments: Establishing \nEHS policies and procedures, evaluating \nchemicals against stringent safety parameters, \nand employing appropriate engineering controls \nwhen warranted\n4. Reducing Waste: Reducing product and \npackaging waste through material minimization, \nreuse, and recycling\n5. Conserving Natural Resources: Minimizing our \nresource consumption by using recycled materials \nand process waterEfforts to ensure safe and healthy work environments, \nreduce waste, conserve resources, and demonstrate \nenvironmental leadership in our communities are detailed \nin the pages that follow.\nOur energy emissions and product design principles \nand efforts are discussed in detail the Climate Change \nand Product Responsibility sections of this report.
