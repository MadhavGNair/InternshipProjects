For example, \nwe developed a metrics-based approach to assessing \nsupply chain risks related to environmental, social, and \ngovernance (ESG) issues, which will be reflected in \nour supplier scorecards, and increased the number of \nsuppliers subject to outreach for RBA self-assessment \nquestionnaires, conflict minerals reporting templates, and \nother due diligence. \nApplied Materials assesses the full extent of a direct \nsupplier\u2019s business and quality management systems \nusing the internal Supplier Performance and Capability \nAssessment (SPACA) tool. In 2020 we issued a revised \nversion to incorporate ESG-related requirements in greater \ndetail. Adding RBA criteria to the SPACA assessment \nprocess enables stronger due diligence to measure and \nhelp drive compliance with human rights and labor \nrequirements, among other topics. Suppliers will use \nthe new SPACA to perform their self-assessments, and \nApplied Materials will use the results to help select \nsuppliers for further assessment.\n  Applied Materials \nStandards of \nBusiness Conduct: \nReflects our \norganizational values \nand our focus on \nethical practices; \nprohibits the use of \nchild labor, forced or \nbonded labor, and \nharsh or inhumane \ntreatment of workers; \nand requires a safe \nwork environment.Responsible \nBusiness Alliance \nCode of Conduct: \nEstablishes standards \nfor safe working \nconditions, respectful \nand dignified \ntreatment of workers, \nand environmentally \nresponsible and \nethical business \noperations in the \nelectronics industry. \nApplied Materials \nwas one of the \nearliest members  \nof the RBA.The California \nTransparency in \nSupply Chains Act of \n2010: Requires many \nmanufacturers in \nCalifornia to disclose \ninformation regarding \ntheir efforts to \naddress the risk of \nslavery and human \ntrafficking in their \nsupply chains.Responsible \nMinerals Sourcing \nPolicy: Governs the \nsourcing of conflict \nminerals contained \nin products sold to \nApplied.Environmental \nHealth and Safety \nPolicy: Encourages \nour suppliers to \nimprove their \nenvironmental \nhealth and safety \nperformance. \nDetails on our Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy \nappear later in this section.
