All products and processes under development \nsince 2018 reflect the application of \u201cDesign for \nSustainability\u201d methods and principles, such as explicit \ndesign targets for optimizing energy and water usage. As \na result, approximately 40% of our current products have \nenhancements available that save customers both energy \nand operations cost.\nQuality Management System: Applied is globally certified \nto ISO 9001:2015 for quality management, among other \nquality certifications.\nDesign for Sustainability Center of Excellence\nPart of our Systems Engineering organization, Applied\u2019s \nDesign for Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE) \nprovides analysis of environmental improvement \nopportunities and design and modeling tools, methods, \ntesting, and training. These help our Semiconductor \nProducts Group and other business units meet their \ncustomers\u2019 sustainability needs, and differentiate their \nproducts by environmental criteria. For example, our \nproprietary web-based modeling tool provides design \nengineers with information on a new design\u2019s resource \nconsumption and other environmental impacts, allowing \ncorrection during the design process.\nWith this design support, our product groups\u2019 \nresponsibilities extend beyond traditional performance \nattributes to encompass sustainability performance \nas well. The product groups also set sustainability \nimprovement targets to meet specific customer \nrequirements. In 2019, several energy-efficient \nimprovements were developed covering a set of  \nproducts that will enable savings of over  \n50 Million kWh/year for one of our customers.\n Measuring Sustainability & Efficiency\nT o meet customers\u2019 sustainability needs, we use a \nquantitative, value-based approach to design. We \nmeasure efficiency in terms of resource or impact per \nunit of production or time based on the SEMI S23 \nstandard, a guide for the conservation of energy, utilities, \nand materials used by semiconductor manufacturing \nequipment. SEMI S23 addresses not only the energy \nused directly by process equipment but also the energy \nrequired to provide cooling and deionized water, exhaust, \nand other resources.\nAvailable energy-saving features on our Endura and \nRadiance Centura products reduced energy consumption \nby 8% and 16%, respectively. We continue to develop \nadditional features for all our products.Design for Environmental Sustainability Playbook\n \nApplied is driving initiatives with its customers \nand suppliers to promote greater sustainability \nindustry-wide, including hardware and software \nupgrades that cut energy use, chemical use, and \ncleanroom space requirements for both new and \nexisting systems.\nAs part of our new ecoUP initiative, we \nannounced a 3x30 goal for our manufacturing \nsystems: On a per-wafer basis, Applied targets a \n30% reduction in equivalent energy consumption, \na 30% reduction in chemical consumption, and a \n30% increase in throughput density (the number \nof wafers processed per square foot of cleanroom \nspace) \u2013 all by 2030.Initiative", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2019.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
