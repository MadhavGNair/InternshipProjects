{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 201923Reducing Our Carbon Footprint\nApplied Materials is committed to decoupling our growth \nas a company from our total carbon footprint, embracing \nan efficient, clean-energy future where prosperity and \nsustainability go hand-in-hand. This is how we shift to a \nthriving, low-carbon economy.\nOur progress rests on increasing energy efficiency, \nboosting our use of renewables, and reducing energy \nuse overall. As we maintain and improve our facility \ninfrastructure, we are advancing energy efficiencies in our \nbuildings by using more energy-efficient building materials \nand equipment. We are also planning to increase our use \nof purchase agreements of renewable energy.Boosting Renewable Energy\nWe are committed to doing our part to achieve a \nlow-carbon future. We\u2019ve already boosted the share of \nrenewable power in our energy mix, and in 2020 we set \na long-term target to source 100% of our energy from \nrenewables by 2030, with an important intermediary step \nof reaching that goal in the U.S. by 2022. With our recent \nsigning of a power purchase agreement (PPA) to support \na new 500 megawatt wind energy project in Crockett \nCounty, T exas, we are well on our way to achieving this \ntarget and contributing to decarbonizing the grid.\nOur sources of renewable energy include or will include:\n\u2022 On-Site Generation: Renewable power generated \nby company-owned renewable energy sources \n(i.e. solar)\n\u2022 Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs): \nMarket-based instruments that represent the \nenvironmental benefits of 1MWh of electricity \ngenerated from renewable energy (RE) sources, \nproviding reductions in our Scope 2 emissions\n\u2022 Virtual Power Purchase Agreements: Financial \ncontracts that provide RECs from a specific \nrenewable energy project not located on \ncompany property\n\u2022 Utility Green Procurement Programs: Direct \npurchase of renewable energy from a utility \nprovider\nBig Business, Small Emissions \nThe U.S. electronics manufacturing industry, \nof which semiconductor manufacturing is a \npart, is responsible for approximately 0.2%* \nof U.S. greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 while \nalso being among its top export sectors.\n \u2013 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nGHG Reporting Program, using 2018 data\n*\t6.3\tmillion\tmetric\ttons\tof\tcarbon\tdioxide\tequivalents\t \n(tCO2-e)\tout\tof\t2,987\tmillion\ttotal\n2  This number was updated from the figure reported in our 2018 CSR \nReport, which had inadvertently included renewable energy that we are \nnot permitted to claim under the California Renewable Portfolio Standard. 2019 201822017\nRenewable energy used as a \npercentage of overall energy use27% 29% 18%\n Share of Renewables in \nOur Energy Mix: Global \nFacilities & OperationsClimate Change", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2019.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
