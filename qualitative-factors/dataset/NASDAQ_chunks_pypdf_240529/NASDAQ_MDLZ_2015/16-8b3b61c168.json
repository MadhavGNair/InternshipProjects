Supporting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment not only helps women to better support their families and contribute to the development of their communities, but ultimately secures the future supply of cocoa by improving its productivity and quality. \nCocoa Life is empowering women in cocoa \ncommunities to be strong, accomplished cocoa farmers. For instance, training programs in Ghana focus on areas of significant need and often include hands-on farming technique demonstrations to ensure correct methods are applied on farms. The skills and knowledge gained from the trainings have helped women realize significant increases in their crop yields, learn ways to acquire or access land for cocoa farming and also become active members of their communities. \nThrough the development of Community Action \nPlans (CAPs), women are able to have a voice in shaping their communities\u2019 future success. Cocoa Life helps women build confidence in their abilities \nto be cocoa farmers and encourages communities to lead their own development.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2015.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
