In particular, the need to increase our focus on energy efficiency as a means to drive continued reductions in manufacturing CO\n2 emissions. \nRecognizing this, our 2020 sustainability goals announced in October 2015, set ambitious targets for an end-to-end approach to reduce our carbon footprint, including:\n\u2022 Adopt science-based targets to reduce our \nabsolute CO\n2 emissions from manufacturing by \n15 percent.* This aligns with current approaches to setting science-based targets to support the global effort to limit climate change to less than 2\u00ba C. \n\u2022 Address deforestation within the company\u2019s key agriculture supply programs, primarily in cocoa and palm oil; and, as progress is made on the ground, publicly report end-to-end carbon footprint reduction.  \n\u2022 Cut our absolute water footprint by reducing water use by 10% in manufacturing, focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce.* \n\u2022 Reduce packaging waste by eliminating 65,000 tonnes of packaging, without contributing to food waste.*\n\u2022 Reduce absolute total manufacturing waste by 20 percent.*\n\u201cThese new goals take our commitment a step forward using the power of our global \nresources and partners to drive meaningful change at scale.\u201d \n\u2014Hubert Weber, Executive Vice President and President, Mondel\u0113z Europe\n*By 2020 vs. 2013 baseline", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2015.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
