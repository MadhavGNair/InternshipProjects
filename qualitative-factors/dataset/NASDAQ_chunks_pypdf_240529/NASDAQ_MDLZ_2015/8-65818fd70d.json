Based on those findings, we focused our efforts on two areas of our supply chain where we can have the greatest impact \u2013 agriculture and our operations. We update our LCA annually and the insights shaped our priorities and 2020 goals. In particular, the insights from our LCA indicated that deforestation within our supply chain represents the largest single contributor to our carbon footprint. That is why we\u2019re taking a lead in addressing deforestation in our key agricultural supply chains, primarily cocoa and palm. We also aim to measure and report our impact as progress is made on the ground.  \n  Carbon footprint, agricultural practices\n  Carbon footprint, deforestation\nWaste \nManagementUsage Distribution ManufactureDelivery  \nto Mfg.Packaging \nMaterialsRaw \nMaterialsSugar Dairy Grains Cocoa OilsLCA Findings\nAddressing deforestation offers largest opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2015.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
