Once improvements are made, facilities are eligible for a Green Garage Certification through Parksmart. We coordinate the procurement of site surveys for our clients.

We were awarded Oracle\u2019s Empower the Green Enterprise Award in recognition of our use of technology and re-engineered back office processes that each year are projected to save:  o 312 tons of paper o 600,000 lbs. of solid wastes o 624 tons of trees o 19,000 lbs. of emissions o 5.1 million gallons of water  \u2022 Paper Reduction, Green Supplies, Recycling & Environmental Event Participation  \u2022 SP+ is committed to the reduced use of paper, green office and cleaning supplies, recycling at client properties, and to participating in environmental awareness events. Our employees are trained to conserve paper, print only what is necessary, use the backside of discarded paper for notes and recycle or reuse paper wherever possible.  \u2022 Online, Paperless iProcurement and iPayables, Accounts Payable & Employee Recruiting Systems  Our procurement, accounts payable and employee recruiting processes have been converted to online, electronic formats. As a result, SP+ not only made those processes more efficient from speed and financial control standpoints, but we also eliminated the large quantitates of paper historically associated with the process of procuring and paying for the goods and services used throughout our North American operations.
