We donate to independent third-\nparty charitable foundations, known as Patient Assistance \nFoundations, who provide financial assistance to patients \nwho might not otherwise be able to afford their medications. \nOur charitable contributions support patients without regard \nto the beneficiary\u2019s choice of product, provider, practitioner, \nsupplier or health plan. We provide guidelines and training \nto our employees who might engage with the Foundations, \nand we review our activities regularly to ensure adherence \nto our guidelines.\nCompassionate Use: Access to Medicines\nBefore a new treatment is widely available to the public, it \nundergoes rigorous clinical testing to ensure it meets the \nsafety and efficacy criteria required for regulatory approval. \nOur Compassionate Use Policy gives certain patients who \nhave serious or life-threatening conditions access to a \npotentially beneficial medicine. The patients who receive \ncompassionate use usually have exhausted all, if any, \navailable treatment options or are unable to participate \nin\u00a0ongoing clinical trials.\n1.
