{"page_content": " \n \nRESPONDING TO GLOBAL HEALTH NEEDS CASE STUDY /\nOur Rapid Response to Global Health Needs\nWe are a different kind of biotech \ncompany, with a distinct ethos of \u2018Doing \nWell By Doing Good\u2019 and a focus on \nhomegrown R&D capabilities. One way \nwe demonstrate our commitment to \ndoing the right thing and to applying \nour technologies effectively is through \nour efforts to respond to public health \nchallenges like infectious disease \noutbreaks.\nDuring the 2014 West African Ebola \noutbreak, our CEO Len Schleifer emailed \nour infectious disease team and asked, \n\u201cwhat can we do to help?\u201d It was a \nperfect opportunity to pair our desire to \nimprove global health with our proprietary \nVelociSuite\u00ae of drug discovery and \ndevelopment technologies.\nWorking with the U.S. government\u2019s \nBARDA, we used our rapid response \napproach to generate potent Ebola \nantibodies at an unprecedented speed, moving from preclinical to clinical \nresearch in a matter of months instead \nof years. Thankfully that outbreak ended \nbefore our triple-antibody cocktail \nreached clinical development. Instead, \nwe tested the investigational medicine \nin a healthy-volunteer Phase\u00a01 trial, \ndemonstrating its safety in humans.\nWhen a new Ebola outbreak began in \nthe DRC in May 2018, we were ready. \nWe worked with the WHO, U.S. FDA and \nother global organizations to have our \nmedicine, REGN-EB3, offered under a \ncompassionate use protocol and included \nin the four-arm PALM clinical trial.\nIn August 2019, the PALM trial was \nstopped early when our Ebola treatment \nwas deemed superior to the previous \nantibody treatment standard of care. \nWe continued to provide this important \ntreatment for free through the PALM trial \nand compassionate use to ensure access for people in need. We were relieved to \nlearn in Spring 2020 that the outbreak in \nthe DRC appears to be winding down.\nIn keeping with our mission and values, \nwhen the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 \nemerged in late 2019 as a growing public \nthreat, we asked ourselves again, \u201cwhat \ncan we do to help?\u201d Building on our Ebola \nand Middle East Respiratory Syndrome \n(MERS) coronavirus experience and using \nthe same VelociSuite\u00ae technologies, we \nare collaborating to rapidly develop a \nnovel antibody cocktail that could be used \nas a preventative or treatment to combat \nthis latest significant global health risk.\nVisit our website  for the latest information \non our COVID-19 response efforts.\u201cTHE LIFE-SAVING RESULTS SEEN WITH \nOUR INVESTIGATIONAL EBOLA THERAPY \nIN 2019 UNDERSCORE THE POTENTIAL \nIMPACT OF REGENERON\u2019S RAPID \nRESPONSE PLATFORM FOR ADDRESSING \nEMERGING OUTBREAKS.
