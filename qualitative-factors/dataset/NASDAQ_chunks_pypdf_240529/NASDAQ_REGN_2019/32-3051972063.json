{"page_content": "Regeneron is involved in research \non generalized lipodystrophy, a rare \ndisorder characterized by the near \ntotal loss of body fat and extreme \nmuscularity. Patients with lipodystrophy \ntend to have metabolic complications \nsuch as glucose intolerance, diabetes \nand elevated levels of fat in the blood. \nThe prevalence for this condition is only \n300 people worldwide.\nVery early in our drug development \nwork, we wanted to understand \npatients\u2019 experience living with lipodys -\ntrophy. We developed a relationship \nwith Lipodystrophy United, a patient \nadvocacy group, which helped us hear \ndirectly from patients about the impact \nof living with this disease. Through \nthis partnership, we  interviewed \npatients, caregivers and doctors to \nbetter  understand challenges they \nface when taking medicines. Given \ntheir loss of body fat, we wanted to be proactive in thinking about new ways \nto develop treatments that would be \nmore  comfortable for people living \nwith lipodystrophy. We plan to apply \nwhat we learned to our future efforts. \nWe are grateful for our partnership \nwith Lipodystrophy United, which has \nbeen instrumental in helping us meet \nand learn from people who live with \nlipodystrophy. CASE STUDY /\nCapturing Patient Insights Early in R&D CASE STUDY /\nAgents of Change\u2009\u2014\u2009  Advocating for Atopic Dermatitis \nLast fall, in recognition of World \nAtopic Dermatitis (AD) Day, our patient \nadvocacy team launched the \u2018Agents \nof Change\u2019 AD Challenge, a multi-year, \nglobal grants initiative to mobilize \nlocal communities and individuals by \ninspiring new ideas to address some of \nthe most difficult challenges for those \nliving with AD.\nPeople living with AD both see and \nfeel its symptoms on their skin. Those \nwith moderate-to-severe AD often \nexperience redness, swelling and \nlesions often causing constant itching \nand painful cracked, crusty and oozing \nskin. All too often, these symptoms \nare more than skin deep too, having an \nimpact on the mental and emotional \nwell-being of people with AD, causing \nfeelings of anxiety, depression and \nloneliness. In our inaugural year, the \n\u2018Agents of Change\u2019 AD Challenge \nfocused on helping to address the bullying that may be experienced by \npeople because of their AD.\nThe response was overwhelmingly \npositive, with more than 40 proposals \nsubmitted from countries around the \nworld within 48 days. Ideas focused \non bringing attention to AD-related \nbullying included proposals such as \nstorytelling projects, art and literary \ncontests, early screenings and self-\nconfidence workshops.\nProposals were reviewed against a \npre-defined set of criteria by a panel \nthat included global leaders from \nthe AD community. In Summer 2020, \nwe will announce the top five grant \nrecipients of the 2019 \u2018Agents of \nChange\u2019 AD Challenge, who will each \nreceive funding of up to $10,000 to \nbring their anti-bullying project to life.\n33 INTEGRITY & EXCELLENCE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES DATA SUMMARY INTRODUCTION\nPDF LAYOUT IMPROVING LIVES\nRegeneron  / 2019 Responsibility Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_REGN_2019.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
