{"page_content": "DESTINATION STEWARDSHIP\nAs a global cruise operator, we visit nearly 500 destinations \nworldwide each year. We work closely with ports and \ngovernments at the destinations we visit to comply with \napplicable laws and regulations and promote responsible \nand sustainable tourism. We seek to maximize social, \neconomic and environmental benefits at the destinations \nwe visit, while delivering exceptional vacation experiences \nto our guests. We also implement responsible and \nenvironmentally-friendly practices at our two incredible \nprivate destinations and throughout all of our destination \ndevelopment and construction projects. \nSUPPORTING COMMUNITIES\nWe provide support for local communities and significantly \ncontribute to local economies at the destinations we visit. \nThe broader cruise ecosystem extends well beyond the cruise \nlines themselves, to ports, tour operators, local suppliers and \nmany more. We invest heavily in our destinations, support \ninfrastructure development through our port commitments \nand fees, sustain the environment and the livelihoods in \nareas we visit and boost local employment. We procure \nvarious local supplies in port including food and beverages, \nhotel supplies, bunker fuel and utilities, all of which help \nstimulate the local economy. Our guests and crew enhance \nthe financial contribution during visits by purchasing shore \nexcursions, tours, meals and other retail goods. According to CLIA research, the cruise industry \ngenerated $154 billion in global economic impact in 2019, including supporting nearly 1.2 million \njobs worldwide.\nCANNES CRUISE CHARTER\nIn 2019, we became the first cruise line to sign a Cruise Charter created by the Municipality of \nCannes together with the CCI Nice C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur to promote sustainable cruise operations in the \nport of Cannes.
