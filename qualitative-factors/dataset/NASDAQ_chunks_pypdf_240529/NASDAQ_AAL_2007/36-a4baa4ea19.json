Waste material that cannot be recycled is \ndisposed of off-site by incineration, placement in \nlandfills or other means. \nMany of our airport stations have integrated waste \nsystems where solid waste generated by all station \ntenants (i.e. other airlines, food service companies, \nretail stores, cargo companies, etc.) are combined \nand managed by the airport authority rather than the \nindividual airline. While this creates an economy of \nscale and minimizes the number of emissions from \nmultiple trash vendors, it also places the authority \nand responsibility for sustainable disposal practices \nwith the airport authority.\nAMR promotes minimization and recycling to \nreduce the volume of solid waste generated but \ndoes not have direct control over the disposal of \nnon-recyclable solid waste generated at facilities \nwith integrated waste disposal services for multiple Through American Airline\u2019s Anything That \nTears  program, nearly 790 tons of paper \ngoods have been recycled since 2004.
