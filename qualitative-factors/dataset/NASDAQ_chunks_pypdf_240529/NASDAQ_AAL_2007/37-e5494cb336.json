Just over 85 percent of our hazardous wastes are generated at \nour three maintenance bases. The largest portion of these waste streams is associated with aircraft maintenance and \nrepair. These wastes include acids, cleaners, and paint wastes derived from our metal plating and coating operations. \nThe remaining portion is generated at our widely dispersed airport locations. Most of these hazardous wastes are \nrelated to cleaners and coatings used for minor maintenance on aircraft and support equipment to keep our aircraft in \nthe air \u2014 what we call line maintenance work. In contrast to our hazardous waste, the majority (over 65 percent) of our \nnon-hazardous waste is generated at our individual stations. Most of our non-hazardous wastes are petroleum-related \nwastes derived from jet fuel, oil, and oily water. Other non-hazardous wastes include fluorescent lights and batteries.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
