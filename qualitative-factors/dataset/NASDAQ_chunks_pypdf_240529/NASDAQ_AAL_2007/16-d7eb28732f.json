A \ncloser look at some of those fuel savings initiatives: \n\u2022 Cleaner Engines:  The turbines that power the \nfleet run more efficiently when they\u2019re clean. For \nthree years, a program has been in place to test \nefficiencies gained from running high-pressure \nwater through engines every six months. So far, the program has added 4.7 million gallons to the run \nrate, providing support to accelerate the program \nin 2009. Our wash program also demonstrates \nour extended environmental commitment, \nproviding an opportunity for us to work with \nlocal authorities to properly treat and return the \nwastewater from the wash stations to the local \nsystems.\n\u2022 Winglets:  Design changes on the aircraft itself \ncan produce substantial reductions in fuel burn \n\u2014 and the corresponding GHG emissions. In \n16During the past year, the Fuel Smart \nteam has been focused on taking extra \nequipment off aircraft to reduce fuel \nconsumption. Norm Gonzalez, narrow-\nbody aircraft quality inspector at the \nTulsa, Okla., Maintenance Base, took this \nidea a step further by suggesting that the \nlogo lights on the left and right horizontal \nstabilizers as well as the associated \nwiring could be removed from the 737 \nfleet.\n\u201cThe lights were simply taking up \nspace for no reason,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cIt \nseemed like a very easy solution. I had \nno idea something so simple could save \nsuch a large amount of fuel.\u201d\nPerson al P rof il e\nEngine Wash\nFor three years, a program has been in place to test efficiencies gained \nfrom running high-pressure water through engines every six months.
