Emissions from these sources include: \njet fuel combustion in aircraft, jet fuel combustion \nat test cells, fuel combustion for on-site electric \ngeneration as well as steam generation and comfort \nheating, fuel consumption in company-owned \nvehicles and ground-support equipment, and process \n(painting and cleaning) emissions at maintenance \nbases. \n The vast majority of nitrous oxide (NO x), carbon \nmonoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and 10 \nmicrometer or smaller particulate matter (PM10) \nemissions are associated with jet fuel combustion in \naircraft.
