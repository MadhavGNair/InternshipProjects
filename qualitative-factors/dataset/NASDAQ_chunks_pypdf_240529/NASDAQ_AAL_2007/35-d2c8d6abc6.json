{"page_content": "AMR Corporation     Environmental Responsibility ReportBeyond Headquarters Initiatives\nAmerican Airlines employees at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport conducted an \ne-waste collection of their own. Nearly 7,000 pounds of TVs, monitors, computers, \nmicrowaves and more have been brought in for recycling in 2008. Nationwide, more \nthan 1.5 million tons of e-waste are thrown into landfills and incinerators every year. \nAs a result, the toxins they contain, such as lead and mercury, end up being released \ninto the air and water. An old TV set can contain up to 10 pounds of lead.\n\u2022 Specifying materials for airport Admiral\u2019s Clubs \nfrom local sources such as using furniture \nfrom a Los Angeles factory in the Los Angeles \nInternational Airport club. The clubs also \nreupholster rather than replace worn pieces.\n\u2022 Repairing office chairs rather than replacing \nthem whenever possible and storing parts from \nunusable chairs for future repairs. \nTo the extent practical, we leverage our corporate \nactions to promote recycling beyond our corporate \nboundaries to our employees\u2019 homes. After we \ncompleted our Quantum Program \u2014 which retired \n30,000 corporate computers in 2006 \u2014 we hosted \nan employee home recycling event on Earth Day. \nEmployees brought in more than 1,400 computer \nmonitors, printers and other consumer electronic \nitems. They loved having the opportunity to \nresponsibly dispose of their personal electronic waste \nand took full advantage as they delivered 25 cubic \nyards of personal e-waste from their own homes \n\u2014 enough to fill a semitrailer. A second event took \nplace in June, and AMR plans to make this a regular \nEarth Day event for our employees. Another creative role has been adopted \nby AMR\u2019s human resource and training \npersonnel. American Airlines training centers \nship old video and audio tapes to a Columbia, \nMo., company that reformats and resells them \nthrough Alternative Community Training (ACT) \nprograms that support employment for people \nwith disabilities. The ACT program AMR \nuses provides employment for more than 40 \nindividuals who have limited employment \nopportunities. Our partnership with the ACT \nprogram began in October 1992, with more \nthan 430,000 tapes donated through the \nyears. At 7 ounces per video tape, that\u2019s \nmore than 188,000 pounds of waste that has \navoided the landfill. In 2007, 1,850 video and \naudio cassettes were recycled.In 2008, Rod Pelander, a customer service \nagent in St. Louis, is coordinating the collection \nand delivery of tapes for recycling by ACT, \nincluding movies brought from home, \nin-flight \u201cEye on American\u201d videos and \ncorporate communications items.Old to New:  Reaching into the Community\nPerson al P rof il e\n35Resource Conservation (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t\n\t", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
