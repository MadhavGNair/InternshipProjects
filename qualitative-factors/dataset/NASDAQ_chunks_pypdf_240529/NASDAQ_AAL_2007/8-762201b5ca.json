{"page_content": "Committed to Preserving the Wonders of Our WorldAn airline\u2019s biggest environmental footprint is left by its \nmost visible property: the aircraft it flies.\nOur aircraft alone account for 99 percent of the direct \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported by AMR. It \nfollows that an airline\u2019s most significant ability to affect \nits environmental impact comes in the form of the \naircraft it puts in the air. \nThe economic realities faced by American and all \ncommercial airlines \u2014 rising fuel costs, intense \ncompetition, and a slowing economy to name just a \n8few \u2014 make decisions that reduce our environmental \nimpact even more challenging. Despite the economic \nrestrictions, we\u2019re striving to strike a balance, \nimplementing projects that reduce our environmental \nfootprint by using our economic resources effectively, \nall while maintaining the safety and reliability that are \ncritical in our business.\nAt any point on American\u2019s historical timeline, our \nfleet included some of the most efficient aircraft \navailable at that time . Today, we at AMR are in the \nmidst of an effort to replace 300 aging MD-80s \u2014 by far Fleet Renewal: Evolution of American\u2019s Environmental Profile\nAs a new era of more efficient aircraft is ushered in, \nthe environmental impact is clear.\nTable 1Aircraft\nNarrow-Body\nBoeing 727\nMD-80\nBoeing 737-800\nWide-Body\nDC-10-30\nMD-11\nBoeing 777First \nPurchase\n1964\n1983\n1999\n1971\n1991\n1999Currently\nin Fleet\n0\n300\n77\n0\n0\n47Final\nAircraft\nRetired\n2002\nNA\nNA\n2000\n2001\nNASeats\n150\n140\n148\n237\n238\n247Fuel Burn\n(gallons/hour)\n1,476\n1,073\n846\n2,977\n2,600\n2,360Fuel Burn\n(gallons/seat/hour)\n9.8\n7.7\n5.7\n12.6\n10.9\n9.6CO2\nEmissions\n(pounds/seat/hour)\n207.6\n161.7\n120.5\n265.0\n230.4\n201.6CO2 Emissions \n(metric tons per \nflight hour)\n14.1\n10.3\n8.1\n28.5\n24.9\n22.6\nBoeing 727 MD-80 Boeing 737-800 DC 10-30 MD-11 Boeing 777\nFleet Renewal(\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t Fleet Renewal \t\nDeclining \nEmissionsFleet Efficiency", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
