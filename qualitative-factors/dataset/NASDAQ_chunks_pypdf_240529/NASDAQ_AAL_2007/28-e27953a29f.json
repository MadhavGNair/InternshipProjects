{"page_content": "Committed to Preserving the Wonders of Our World 28As a result of the Montreal Protocol, all domestic \nproduction and importation of HCFC-141b ended in \n2002 as a global response to depletion of the earth\u2019s \nozone layer. Under this treaty, rules were established \nfor eliminating ODSs worldwide. First, refrigerants \nand solvents called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), \nhalogenated fire suppressants, and other Class 1 \nODSs were phased out.Currently, the industry is phasing out less damaging \nClass 2 ODSs; however, there are no legal restrictions \nto buying, stocking, selling, or using the remaining \ndomestic supply of HCFC-141b. Not all HCFCs will be \nphased out equally. HCFC-141b is being phased out \nfirst due to its wide use and relatively high potential \nto damage the ozone as compared to other HCFCs. \nLess damaging Class 2 ODSs, such as HCFC-225, will \nbe phased out by 2015. \nMaking the Switch\nAmerican Airlines is heavily involved in researching non-ODS alternatives to HCFC-\n141b, evaluating substances that will adequately and safely replace HCFC-141b while \nnot emitting high levels of volatile organic compounds restricted by the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Unlike your neighborhood mechanic who can simply switch to any \none of several commercial alternatives currently available, our ability to replace HCFC-\n141b with a commercially available alternative is limited by the requirement that any \nreplacement solvent be approved and certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. \n(\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t Emissions\t", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
