{"page_content": "Committed to Preserving the Wonders of Our WorldTransportation-Related Fuel\nUse\nBy far the most significant resource we use in our \noperation, as measured by volume, weight, or any \nother relevant metric, is transportation-related fuels \n(over 99 percent, as measured in BTUs), primarily jet \nfuel consumed in aircraft but also gasoline and diesel \nfor fleet vehicles and ground support equipment.  \nJust how much fuel do we use? Combined, American \nAirlines and American Eagle used more than 3 billion \ngallons of jet fuel in 2007. While this may sound like a \nlarge number at first, consider that it is less than the \nvolume of fuel used by U.S. cars and trucks in just two \nweeks. It allowed us to carry more than 121 million \npassengers and almost 700,000 tons of cargo for an \naverage distance of 861 miles. \n \nFuel Conservation*\nJust as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction \nmay be vital to the health of our planet, fuel \nconservation is vital to our company\u2019s financial \nhealth.
