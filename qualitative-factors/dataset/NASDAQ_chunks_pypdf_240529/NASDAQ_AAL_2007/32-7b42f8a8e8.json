{"page_content": "Committed to Preserving the Wonders of Our World 32Reduced Consumption\nThe maintenance bases that make fleet aircraft \nmodifications, such as the fuel-saving winglet \nadditions, require people, spacious facilities, and \ncomplex systems. Consider just one, our Kansas \nCity, Mo., facility. Historically, this facility required \nmore than 60 million gallons of water every year. This \npresented significant opportunity for savings. \nThe Kansas City base operates on power from a \ncentral utility plant that used water from a 50,000-\ngallon steel tank installed in the 1970s. Replacement \nof that tank, which had begun to develop leaks, \nhas contributed to reducing the base\u2019s total water \nconsumption from 60.6 million gallons in 2005 to 43.4 \nmillion gallons in 2007, a drop of 28.4 percent.\nWater savings are being realized at our headquarters \ncampus in Dallas as well. In the past four years, \nAmerican Airlines has saved 79 million gallons \nof water by using an irrigation system that calculates the daily moisture content of the soil to \nschedule watering and reduce chemical use. The \nAcequia process of managing irrigation uses local \nenvironmental data and its experts\u2019 knowledge of \nagronomy and soil sciences to simplify complex \nlandscape maintenance. \nSmart Irrigation\nAmerican Airlines has saved 79 million gallons of water by using \nan irrigation system that calculates the daily moisture content of \nthe soil to schedule watering and reduce chemical use.Total Estimated Water Use at\nMajor AMR Facilities\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n2005 2006 2007gallons (millions)533.3554.6 556.6\nFigure 1\n(\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t Resource Conservation", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
