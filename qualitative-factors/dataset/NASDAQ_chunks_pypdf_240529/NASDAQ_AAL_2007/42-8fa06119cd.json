U.S. commercial aviation consumes less than \n3 percent of total U.S. energy use, but drives about 6 \npercent of the U.S. gross economic output and just \nunder 9 percent of national employment. Secure \nand sustainable fuel sources are essential for its \ncontinued prosperity. Meanwhile, concerns have risen \ninternationally about the environmental impacts of \naviation growth. \nAmerican Airlines and many supply chain members \nthat serve the aviation industry participate in the \nCommercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative \n(CAAFI), which was established to enhance energy \nsecurity and environmental sustainability for aviation \nby exploring the potential use of alternative fuels. \nCAAFI provides a forum for the U.S. commercial \n(\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t Looking Ahead", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
