{"page_content": "Committed to Preserving the Wonders of Our WorldCommercial Aviation and Domestic \nGHG Emissions\nIndividually, generation of electricity and \ntransportation each account for nearly a third of \nall domestic GHG emissions. The remaining third \nof domestic GHG emissions is produced by the \naggregate emissions from industrial, agricultural, \ncommercial and residential sources. \n \nThe most recent U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) data\u2021 indicate that mobile aviation \nsources contribute approximately 2.9 percent \nof the nation\u2019s GHG emissions or approximately \n9 percent of all transportation sources. Note \nthat the EPA estimate for the aviation category \nincludes operations other than those conducted by \ncommercial carriers such as American Airlines and \nAmerican Eagle. \n22Emissions*\nAMR is continuing with its commitment made in the 2006 Environmental \nResponsibility Report (ERR) to measure Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions on an annual \nbasis and report this data to shareholders and the community. \nSee Appendix D on page 51 for a \ndescription of how we derived our \nGHG emission factors. \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\nIndividually, generation of electricity and transportation each \naccount for nearly a third of all domestic GHG emissions.
