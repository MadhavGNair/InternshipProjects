{"page_content": "Committed to Preserving the Wonders of Our World 38Steve Wallace isn\u2019t shy.\nThe lead environmental coordinator and technical \ncrew chief for American\u2019s operations in Boston saw \nan opportunity when he spotted Steve Thomas, the \nrenowned host of PBS television series \u201cThis Old \nHouse,\u201d in the Admirals Club.\n\u201cI knew he was a skier, so I walked up, introduced \nmyself, and asked if he\u2019d be interested in being part \nof American\u2019s charity ski event benefitting the Cystic \nFibrosis Foundation,\u201d says Wallace, who started with American in 1973 as a fleet service clerk. \u201cHe signed \non, and we\u2019ve been friends ever since.\u201d\nRecently, that friendship has put Wallace to work in his \nspare time, unearthing projects for Thomas\u2019 new series, \n\u201cRenovation Nation\u201d on Discovery Network\u2019s Planet \nGreen.\nWallace also managed a major project for Thomas, \none with both personal and professional ties. Thomas \nwanted to renovate a summer home on a remote \nisland off the coast of Maine, using the latest in green \nmaterials and leaving only the smallest footprint on the \nenvironment. The effort is being featured on \n\u201cRenovation Nation.\u201d\n\u201cThe greenest thing I did was bring all the needed \nequipment to the island from nearby suppliers, creating \na nearly carbon-neutral project. When the work was \ndone, every trace of our presence was erased from \nthe fields and trails we used to transport construction \nmaterials and equipment. It was like we\u2019d never been \nthere,\u201d Wallace says. \u201cWe built a working barn with a \nguest quarters featuring 100 percent recycled roofing \nmaterials designed to last 80 years.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cool to research projects that \nhave an environmental impact, \u201d \nWallace says. \u201cIt\u2019s what we need \nto be doing. \u201dWallace also has a long list of experimental green projects \nunder way at work. Whether he\u2019s testing energy efficiency \nprograms to reduce the environmental footprint of the station \nor evaluating a bag belt impregnated with Teflon to reduce drag \n\u2014 and, correspondingly, energy consumption \u2014 Wallace is \npassionate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to research projects that have an environmental \nimpact,\u201d Wallace says. \u201cIt\u2019s what we need to be doing. It\u2019s going \nto save the planet eventually. I\u2019m doing what I can to make that \nhappen.\u201d\nWallace\u2019s efforts include recycling virtually everything at the \nstation, testing a baggage claim belt plate made of a composite \nmaterial that would reduce the belt\u2019s weight by 7,000 pounds, \nand installing solar panels in seldom-used vehicles to make \nsure the batteries stay charged enough to start when they\u2019re \nneeded.\nThe Thomas house project turned into a family affair for \nWallace, whose 17-year-old son Joseph came along on the \nproject.\n\u201cHe ended up building a potter\u2019s shed almost entirely by \nhimself. He showed up a kid, but left a pretty decent carpenter.\u201d\nTaking It Home: Passion for Green\nPerson al P rof il e(\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t Resource Conservation", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 38, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
