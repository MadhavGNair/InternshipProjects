{"page_content": "AMR Corporation     Environmental Responsibility ReportThe 737-800, despite its price tag and the \naccompanying integration cost, has, through its \nefficiency levels, overcome those obstacles to make \ngood business sense for the American fleet. These \nfuel efficiency gains will help reduce fuel costs and \nour vulnerability to the volatile fuel market we face \ntoday. It will, in effect, hedge us from future volatility. Fuel becomes a smaller part of our cost equation, \noffset by the new but predictable cost of a loan \npayment on new aircraft.\nPlacing the Order\nThe production capacity of major aircraft \nmanufacturers also limits when we \u2014 and any other \nairline \u2014 can put new aircraft in the air. Unlike a \nconsumer looking for a new car, no dealer showroom \ndisplays aircraft ready to purchase. Manufacturing \naircraft takes time and is complex, requiring the \nassembly of millions of parts. With these constraints, \nBoeing\u2019s production line produces about 30 737s per \nmonth. Each aircraft is committed to a purchaser, \nso it is not possible to simply purchase one after it \ncomes off the production line.\nTo secure a spot on the production line, airlines often \nsign contracts for aircraft purchases up to 10 years in \nadvance. American\u2019s contract with Boeing included \norders for 737-800s beginning in 2013. Fortunately, \nour flexible purchase agreement enables us to \nadvance 76 of our 737-800 orders to bring them into \nour fleet in 2009 and 2010.\n11\nFuel Efficiency Overcomes Cost Obstacles\nThe fuel efficiency gains of the 737-800 overcome other \ncost obstacles to make good business sense for the \nAmerican fleet.Fleet Renewal (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t \t\nDomestic Airline Jet Fuel Prices\n$3.30\n$3.00\n$2.70\n$2.40\n$2.10\n$1.80\n$1.50\n$1.20\n$0.90\n$0.60\n$0.30\nJan-92 Jan-94 Jan-96 Jan-98 Jan-00 Jan-02 Jan-04 Jan-06 Jan-08 per gallon\nFigure 1", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
