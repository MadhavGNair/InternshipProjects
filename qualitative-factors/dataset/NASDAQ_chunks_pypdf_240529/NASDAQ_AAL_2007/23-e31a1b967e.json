{"page_content": "AMR Corporation     Environmental Responsibility Report2007 GHG Results\nAMR\u2019s GHG emissions for calendar year 2007 slightly \ndecreased from 2006 emissions. Our total GHG \nemissions are attributed primarily (approximately 98 \npercent) to carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from jet \nfuel combustion. Scope 1  direct emissions are attributed primarily to \nCO 2 emissions from jet fuel combustion related to \naircraft operations. Other sources of Scope 1 direct \nemissions are not material to our cumulative GHG \nemissions; however, they are included in our GHG \ninventory for completeness.\nScope 2  indirect emissions remained essentially \nflat with respect to prior years and account for CO 2 \nemissions associated with electricity that AMR \npurchases from electric utilities. \nScope 3  emissions are not included in our GHG \ninventory. Due to the quantity of jet fuel used in \ncomparison to all other materials, jet fuel is the \nsingle most relevant factor driving our GHG. As such, \nthe exclusion of Scope 3 emissions is not considered \nto have a material effect on the results presented in \nthis ERR.

The \ndirect and indirect emissions are then divided into three broad categories, or scopes.\nScope 1:  Includes all direct GHG emissions. For AMR, jet fuel combustion is the primary source.\nScope 2:  Indirect emissions associated with the consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam. For AMR, these \nare primarily emissions resulting from electricity purchases.\nScope 3:  Reflects indirect emissions that result from activities outside the control of a reporting organization. \n23Summary of GHG Emissions", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
