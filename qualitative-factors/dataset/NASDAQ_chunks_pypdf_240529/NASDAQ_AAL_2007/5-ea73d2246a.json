These specialists assist in the oversight of \nAmerican\u2019s environmental compliance at locations around \nour system. For these key employees, their daily routine \ncan include a little diplomacy, plenty of public relations, a \nsmall mountain of paperwork and a ton of details to sweat.\nBut for Jay Valenzuela, the full-time lead environmental \ncoordinator (LEC) at Los Angeles International Airport \n(LAX), it all boils down to an employee\u2019s environmental \nawareness.\n\u201cAs an LEC, I have to maintain the environmental \nawareness of employees to an extent that it is on their \nminds regardless of what they\u2019re doing. We deal with a \nlot of laws and rules, but so much of it is about common \nsense,\u201d Jay says. \u201cEspecially here in Southern California, \nwe have to keep everyone\u2019s awareness level high to meet \nwhat may be the most stringent environmental rules in the \nAA system.\u201d\nJay never expected to be in this role. He started with \nAmerican in 1975 as a flight attendant. He\u2019s worked in \nreservations, passenger service, cargo, safety, and other \nmanagement roles. But he\u2019s been the LEC at the massive \nLAX operation for seven years.\n\u201cI learn something new every day \u2014 it\u2019s both challenging \nand fulfilling. There\u2019s so much to know about the \nenvironmental aspect of this company. I\u2019ve come to see \nhow what we do at work affects me personally. What we \ndo at work affects how everyone deals with environmental \nissues at home,\u201d Jay says. \u201cMore people are looking for ways to recycle, especially \ne-waste. People are now very aware of chemical mixing. Even \nif they\u2019d never mixed things like bleach and ammonia at home, \nmaybe they had kept them in the same tray or used them in the \nsame room. They\u2019d never do that now.\u201d\nLittle examples like that add up to an awareness level that \nchanges the way the company operates. Jay tells people he \nworks with to expect the unexpected.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something that comes up that we haven\u2019t seen \nbefore. But we can determine what to do in any situation if we \nthink it through,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key is to know your station and \nto use common sense to guide your people to the right solution.\u201d\nJay can cite plenty of examples that demonstrate how \nemployee awareness is reaching beyond the workplace. He \ndescribes how he got a call recently from an employee whose \ncar was leaking what he thought was Freon in the parking lot. \nIt was antifreeze, but the important thing to Jay was that this \nemployee contacted him because he knew that air issues are \na major concern at LAX.\nJay loves it that employees will call him with that type of \nquestion, looking for advice regarding environmental issues \nat home.\n\u201cIt goes back to the employee\u2019s environmental awareness level. \nI was never green-conscious. But that\u2019s because I was unaware \nof the effects of my actions and what options are available to \nme to do the right thing,\u201d Jay says. \u201cWhen one person is aware, \ninteractions with other employees spread that awareness, \nwhether the employee is conscious of it or not. That awareness \nis what changes things.\u201dEnvironmental Awareness:  Beyond the Job\nPerson al P rof il e\n5Jay Valenzuela, the lead environmental \ncoordinator at Los Angeles International \nAirport, sees awareness spreading \nbeyond the workplace.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
