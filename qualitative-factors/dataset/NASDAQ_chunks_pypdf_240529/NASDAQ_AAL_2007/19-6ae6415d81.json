{"page_content": "AMR Corporation     Environmental Responsibility ReportNon-Transportation-Related Energy\nDirect Energy Sources*\nOur principal efforts have been and are focused on \nreducing energy use associated with transportation. \nHowever, our macro environmental footprint is \nalso shaped, in part, by other important but less \nsignificant energy sources. These energy sources \ninclude natural gas for process steam generation and \ncomfort heating, electricity purchased from utilities, \nand small quantities of fuel oil to provide backup \nelectricity. Using less energy helps to minimize AMR\u2019s \nenvironmental impact both by emitting less air \npollutants, including GHGs, and also by preserving \nsome of our natural resources for future generations.\nEnergy Use\nIn 2007, AMR used 598,000 megawatt-hours of \nelectricity and 15.9 million therms of natural gas. \nDirect energy use was essentially flat when compared \nto 2006. \n Energy Conservation ** \nReducing energy consumption is an effort that \ntouches each AMR department, location, and \nemployee. In 2005, AMR formed our Utility \nManagement Council to bring employees together \nto evaluate potential projects that could reduce \nour utility use. Approximately 90 percent of AMR\u2019s \ndirect utility costs are realized at just 10 of our \nlocations, which includes major airport locations, \nmaintenance facilities, and our headquarters \ncampus. Thus, AMR\u2019s Utility Management Council \nmembers represent those locations and key \nheadquarters departments. \nTypically, the most effective means of reducing utility \nconsumption is through new technology requiring \ncapital investment. As a matter of good business, \nwe seek outside funding to reduce our investment, \nsuch as airport funds and utility company rebates, \n19\nAMR\u2019s Environmental Impact\nUsing less energy helps to minimize AMR\u2019s environmental impact \nboth by emitting less air pollutants, including GHGs, and also by \npreserving some of our natural resources for future generations.Purchased Electricity\n600,000\n500,000\n400,000\n300,000\n200,000\n100,000\n2005 2006 2007megawatt-hours\nPurchased Natural Gas\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0therms (millions)\n2005 2006 2007Fuel and Energy Use and Conservation (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\t (\nFigure 4\nFigure 5* GRI Performance Indicator EN3 ** GRI Performance Indicator EN5, EN6, and EN7", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2007.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
