{"page_content": "2022 CSR REPORT | 9\nMENTORSHIP  \nAT AMERIS \nTeammates at Ameris have significant talent \nand experience to share with one another. \nIn 2022, our Mentor Ameris program once \nagain matched a diverse group of high-\npotential teammates with designated \nmentors for a nine-month mentorship \nexperience. Even outside of this formal \nprogram, Ameris encourages teammates and \nleaders to find mentors or become mentors. \nIn 2022, our Learning and Development \nteam created guides to support mentorship \nacross the company; one guide to help \nteammates establish mentor relationships \nand another guide with tips for mentors.\n\u201cThe 2022 Ameris Mentor \nProgram is an experience that \nwas just as beneficial to me \nas a mentor as it was to my \nmentee.  Not only did it allow \nme to view the perspective of \nour bank through someone \nelse\u2019s eyes, but it also gave \nme an opportunity to interact \nwith someone from another \nbusiness line within our \norganization with whom I \nwould not typically have the \nopportunity to network.\u201d  \n\u2013 Chris M., Market President \nAlbany, Georgia  \u201cI have a saying, we all have \nthe same goals, just different \nroles. The mentor program is \nno different except the goal \nis people versus strategy. \nTherefore, the value I saw \nis expanding my network of \nAmeris colleagues through \nbuilding relationships.\u201d \n\u2013 Tom U., Regional Credit \nOfficer\u201cI felt honored to participate \nin the mentorship program. It \nwas valuable having a trusted \nadvisor and being able to \nbenefit from their knowledge \nand experience. Her guidance \nand encouragement helped  \nme grow both personally  \nand professionally.\u201d\n\u2013 Jocelyn B., Underwriter\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ABCB_2022.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
