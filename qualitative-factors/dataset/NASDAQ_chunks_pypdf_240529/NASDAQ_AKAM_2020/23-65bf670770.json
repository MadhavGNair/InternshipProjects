{"page_content": "akamai.com    |   23Scope 2 Renewable Energy Methodology \nAkamai tracks and monitors green power generation \nfrom renewable energy purchases at Scope 2 \nfacilities as a part of our overall Scope 2 GHG \nfootprint. The category of contractual instruments \nwhen calculating the market-based method will take \ninto account the following areas:\n\u2022 Energy attribute certificates (GOs, RECs)  \n\u2022 Direct contracts such as power purchase \nagreements (PPAs and VPPAs), where other \ninstruments or energy attribute certificates do \nnot exist  \n\u2022 Pass-through from vendors through letters of \nattestation to Akamai  \n\u2022 Supplier-specific emission rates  \n\u2022 Residual mix (e.g., the emissions rate left after the \nthree other contractual information items are \nremoved from the system) \nIn an effort to limit our impact on the environment, \nAkamai participates in the Renewable Energy Buyer \nAlliance and Future of Internet Power Documentation  \nRequirements for Supplier-Procured Renewable \nEnergy, a collaborative initiative composed of users \nand providers of colo data center services. The \ndocument provided the groundwork for innovative \npass-through renewable energy reportable as Scope \n2 emissions in facilities that are operated by providers \nof colo space. The procurement of renewable energy \nby our colo providers now has a direct impact on \nScope 2 emissions on how much of the footprint is \nrenewable without additional renewable  \nenergy procurement. Scope 3 \nScope 3 covers remaining areas of indirect emissions \ncoming from business operations. For example, this \nwould include the emissions coming from the \ncreation of our designed hardware, electricity usage \ncoming from Akamai Accelerated Network Partners \n(AANP), corporate travel, and waste disposal. Scope \n3 generally focuses on the remaining operations \ncoming from up the value chain, and also has a focus \non upstream and downstream activities. Upstream \nincludes all of the emission factors that occur when a \nproduct is sold by the producer. Downstream occurs \nonce the product is sold, and includes storage and \nend-of-life activities, such as shipping and recycling. \nScope 3 Focus Areas \nWhen considering the reporting areas that fall into \nScope 3, focused mainly on our wider footprint and \nupstream indirect emissions, Akamai will report in \nthe following areas:\n\u2022 Emissions to manufacturing network hardware \n(capital goods)  \n\u2022 Fuel and energy-related activities, including \ntransmission and distribution losses  \n\u2022 Emissions related to transporting hardware \n(upstream transportation and distribution)  \n\u2022 Emissions related to storing hardware (upstream \ndistribution)  \n\u2022 Business travel, including corporate commercial \nand private travel  \n\u2022 Upstream leased assets (free space and traffic \n[AANP], diesel generators, PUE  \nwhere applicable)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2020.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
