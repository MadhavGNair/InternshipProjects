We committed to support this program to \nincrease environmentally sustainable practices \namong the business community. As a CitySwitch \nsignatory, we have volunteered to achieve a NABERS \nEnergy tenancy rating of 6 stars.\nEmployees\nIn September, we launched a partnership with \nCommon Energy in Massachusetts, inviting \nemployees to support a new, local, clean energy \nproject while helping to lower emissions in the community. The project, currently under development in \nCarver, Massachusetts, is one of the first in the nation to \ncombine clean energy and on-site agriculture production. \nOnce completed, the project will generate approximately \n4,000 megawatt Hours (MWh) and forgo more than 900 \nmetric tons (MT) of greenhouse gas emissions each year. \nAs an added benefit, for each enrolled Akamai employee, \nCommon Energy made a charitable contribution on our \nbehalf to All in Energy, a local nonprofit organization \ndoing energy efficiency outreach with a focus on equity \nand engaging hard-to-reach populations.\nCustomers and Suppliers\nWe are committed to partnering with our customers and \nsuppliers to benefit the community. This past July, we \npartnered with Microsoft on Hackathon 2020 \u2014 an annual \nworldwide event to inspire new ideas, create change, and \nmake a global difference. Together, the Hackathon 2020 \nteam decided to develop an app which helps individuals \nassess their own personal choices and the effect of those \nchoices on their carbon footprint.\u201cOn behalf of the North Sydney \nCouncil and the CitySwitch \nProgram, I am delighted to \nwelcome on board Akamai \nTechnologies as our newest North \nSydney signatory.
