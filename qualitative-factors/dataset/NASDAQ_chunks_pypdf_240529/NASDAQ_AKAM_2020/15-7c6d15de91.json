Planting \ntrees remains one of ways we can help to reduce \nglobal carbon emissions, so \u2014 in April 2020 for Earth \nMonth \u2014 we committed to planting 7,500 trees (one \nfor every employee) with One Tree Planted in four \nlocations around the world by the end of 2021. As \nglobal deforestation continues, reforestation \nprojects like these will help to provide the clean air \nwe breathe for years to come and improve the \ncommunities of which we are a part.\nContinuing in our commitment to replenishment \nprojects, in April we announced the launch of our \nAccelerator Program with the Indian Institute of \nTechnology Madras (IIT Madras) , supporting \ninnovators and building solutions to address India\u2019s \nwater challenges. The Accelerator Program, a \nconcerted effort by our leadership team in India, is \nbeing launched at a time when we are witnessing a \nrising demand for water globally, caused by \nexponential population growth coupled with a \nchanging climate that is making rainfall less \npredictable. In Bangalore, India, where Akamai has a \nlarge operation, we are witnessing the impact of rapid \nurbanization on our water resources like never before.\nClimate Policy\nTo help drive systematic change across the industry, \nwe participated in conversations focused on long-\nterm environmental improvement. Important climate \npolicies are being debated at every level of \ngovernment \u2014 in cities, counties, states, and \ncountries \u2014 and we are stepping up and speaking \nout for climate policy.Some highlights of our 2020 work include: \n\u2022 On January 22, the day after the 2020 \nMassachusetts State of the Commonwealth \nspeech, our Sustainability team participated in a \nclean energy legislative preview with Governor \nCharlie Baker, Secretary of Energy and \nEnvironmental Affairs Kathleen Theoharides, and \nrepresentatives from Ceres, and other key \nbusinesses across the state. This was a part of \nconversation around a multi-state Transportation \nand Climate Initiative, which is working to build a \nregional program that would cap and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions from the \ntransportation sector across the Northeast and \nMid-Atlantic regions, and invest the proceeds in a \ncleaner, more resilient, and more equitable \nlow-carbon transportation system.\u201cIIT Madras is pleased to partner with \nAkamai Technologies in the Accelerator \nProgram designed to support \ninnovators in the clean water sector, \nwho have the potential to create social \nimpact. The International Centre for \nClean Water (ICCW), an initiative of \nIITM, is the technical and business \nmentor of the innovators, ATREE and \nFFEM. ICCW is also engaged in \nstrengthening the Program\u2019s vision and \ndesign of future cohorts to maximise \nthe cumulative social impact over the \nnext few years\u201d\n\u2014 Professor T.
