{"page_content": "akamai.com    |   22A2 | Carbon Accounting  \nGreenhouse gas (GHG) protocol establishes \ncomprehensive global standardized frameworks to \nmeasure and manage GHG emissions from private \nand public sector operations, value chains, and \nmitigation actions. Akamai has taken the accepted \nscope framework and applied the methodology to \nour own business activities. \nScope 1 \nScope 1 (also known as direct GHG emissions) \nincludes fuel combustion, company vehicles, and \nfugitive emissions. As an example, Scope 1 can \ninclude any production of electricity through a \ngenerator that burns fuel for power or through \nbuilding equipment that produces gasses/vapors. \nOther emissions sources from Scope 1, such as \nfugitive emissions, are gases or vapors from \nequipment that contribute to building operations that \ncould cause air pollution and climate change. \nScope 1 Focus Areas\nAkamai focuses on several areas under Scope 1, \nincluding any impact our office buildings may have \non the environment. Under these definitions, we \nreport on our: \n\u2022 Diesel generator emissions\n\u2022 Natural gas generator emissions\n\u2022 Gasoline generator emissions\n\u2022 Off-gassing from building  \nmechanical systems\n\u2022 Company-owned vehicles  \nScope 2\nScope 2, also known as indirect GHG emissions by a \ncompany, includes the consumption of purchased \nelectricity, heat, or steam. This includes all direct \nleased colocation (colo) operations that impact the cost of goods sold (COGS). These larger \ndeployments include servers, switches, routers, \nand various network components. Another \nexample of Scope 2 would be natural gas \npurchased to heat the buildings Akamai leases. \nScope 2 Focus Areas\nAkamai focuses on several areas under Scope 2, \nincluding our direct office operations and our \nvarious types of colo deployments. Under these \ndefinitions, we report on our: \n\u2022 Electricity emissions from colo operations, \nincluding Akamai-owned data center (AODC) \nserver, switch, router, and network component \nelectricity; and colo server, switch, router, and \nnetwork component electricity (not including \nnondirect impact, Akamai Accelerated \nNetworks Partners [AANP], free space, and \npower deployments)  \n\u2022 Colo operations electricity (not including \nnondirect impact, AANP , free space, and \npower deployments) when fully controlled  \n\u2022 Office electricity   \n\u2022 Lab electricity (cooling if available)  \n\u2022 Office heating, steam, and natural gas \nconsumption  \n\u2022 Renewable energy virtual power purchase \nagreements (VPPAs), renewable energy \ncredits (RECs), and guarantees of origin (GOs) \n ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2020.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
