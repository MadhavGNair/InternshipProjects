{"page_content": "akamai.com    |   9Data Center Partners \nWe rely on our colocation partners for clean energy to \npower our operations in many of our edge locations. \nSince we can influence how these data centers are \npowered, we encourage our partners to procure clean \nenergy and even offer training on how to do so. From \nthe beginning of our contract, we ask that renewable \nenergy be attributed to the equivalent amount of \nenergy we use per facility. Our partners verify the  \nuse of 100% renewable energy in our data center \noperations to ensure we are using renewable  \nsources of power.  \nIt is through collaboration on projects and training \nprograms like these that we are able to have a twofold \nimpact. First, we lessen our emissions by meeting our \n30% efficiency and 50% renewable energy goals and, \nsecond, we encourage a paradigm shift in the way the \ndata center industry thinks about efficiency and \nrenewable energy.\nPUE in 2020 for our Akamai-owned \ndata centers was 15% lower than \nour data center portfolio average.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2020.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
