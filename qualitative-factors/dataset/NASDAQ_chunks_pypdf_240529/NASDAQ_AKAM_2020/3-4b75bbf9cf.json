Investors \nwant it.4 Customers demand it.5 And the planet \ndesperately needs it.6 \nWhile the internet will always use energy, it should \nbe used in the most responsible way possible. The \nUnion of Concerned Scientists states it well. \nAkamai heeds the call for change and responsible \naction in our operations, our supply chain decisions, \nand in the global community. We recognize that in \nour role as the leading performance, security, and \ndelivery provider, we share the responsibility for \nreducing the internet\u2019s carbon emissions. That\u2019s why \nback in 2015, we set goals to lessen our emissions \nby 30% year over year, power our network with 50% \nrenewable energy, and recycle 100% of our e-waste \nall by the end of 2020.
