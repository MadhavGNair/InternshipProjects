After \nthe Supreme Court decision to repeal Roe v. Wade, we \nimplemented changes to enhance equal access to \nreproductive healthcare. To reinforce our commitment that all \nemployees and dependents have equitable access to \ncomprehensive reproductive health benefits \u2014 regardless of \nwhere they may live \u2014 we will support employees or \ndependents who need to travel outside their local state for \naccess to abortion services.Health, Safety, and Wellbeing\nThe physical, mental, and emotional health and wellbeing \nof our employees and communities is a priority for Seagen. \nWe continuously work to ensure our employees have the \nsupport necessary to conduct their work safely. \nOur employee initiatives focus on protecting our team\u2019s health, safety, \nand wellbeing.
