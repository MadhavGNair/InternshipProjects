{"page_content": "Supplier quality management\nSince our acquisition of HalioDx, we \nhave started to transfer the manufac -\nturing of our IVD test kits from a \nsecondary manufacturer to our facility \nin Marseille, France. This transition will \nallow us to achieve end-to-end control of \nour IVD supply chain. We also maintain \ntraceability for our IVD products from \nraw materials to shipment using unique \nbatch numbers for each operational \nstage, which are printed on labels and \nelectronically filed in our inventory control \nsystem. \nWe evaluate the ability of our suppliers to \nmeet our quality specifications in a timely \nand cost-effective manner. Key suppliers \nthat we have determined to be critical to \nour supply of reagents, equipment, and \nother materials and services that we use to perform our tests are evaluated for \ncompliance with third-party standards \nsuch as ISO 13485, ISO 9001, and \ngovernment agency audit or certification \nprograms. 100% of our key suppliers \nparticipate in third-party audit or certifi -\ncation programs for quality assurance, \ncontrol, or regulatory purposes. \nManagement of critical materials\nWhile we procure many of the reagents \nand equipment used to perform our \nCLIA tests from sole suppliers, we have \ndeveloped alternate sourcing strategies \nfor certain materials when possible to \nmitigate potential shortages and supply \nchain pressures. We also seek to establish \nsecondary suppliers for materials critical \nto the production of our IVD products \nwhen possible. While certain critical \nmaterials for our IVD products cannot be changed without performing equivalency  \nstudies, we maintain adequate safety \nstock of these materials to avoid  \nproduct backorders. \nLooking ahead\nAs we continue to expand our scope to \ncover global diagnostic needs, we are \ntaking steps to harmonize our supply \nchain management processes and \nstandards across our global facilities. \nWe are in the process of developing a \nSupplier Code of Conduct, which will lay \nout our expectations for our suppliers \nand business partners on key issues such \nas health and safety, human rights, and \nenvironmental sustainability. \n33\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VCYT_2023.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
