{"page_content": "Our rooftop and condensing unit markets \nprimarily consist of units installed on commercial or industrial structures, generally less than ten stories in height. Our air handling units, self-contained units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, chillers, and coils are suitable for all sizes of commercial and industrial buildings.  The size of these markets is determined primarily by the number  of commercial and industrial building completions and replacement demand from existing buildings. \nThe replacement market consists of products \ninstalled to replace units/components worn or damaged and to upgrade certain components such as low leakage dampers, high- efficiency heat exchangers, and modern  control components. \nCurrently, close to two-thirds of the industry\u2019s \nmarket consists of replacement units. The commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations, generally tied to housing starts and the economy, but has a lag factor of six to 18 months. Housing starts, in turn, are affected by such factors as interest rates, the state of the economy, population growth, and the relative age of the population. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market. \nBased on our 2021 consolidated sales of $530.4 \nmillion at AAON Oklahoma and AAON Coil Products, we estimate these sales represent about 10% share of the greater than five-ton rooftop market and a 2% share of the less than five-ton market. In 2021, approximately 60% of our sales generated from the renovation and replacement markets and 40% from new construction. The ratio of sales for new construction versus replacement to particular customers is related to various factors. Generally, the cyclicality of the new construction market impacts this ratio the most over an economic cycle. \nTo date, our sales have been primarily to the \ndomestic market. Foreign sales accounted for approximately $14.8 million, $11.7 million, and $14.8 million of our net sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. As a percentage of net sales, foreign sales accounted for approximately 3%, 2%, and 3% of our net sales in each of those years, respectively. \n NET SALES\n13", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAON_2021.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
