Research and Development (R&D) has become a critical factor to compete in the HVAC equipment industry. We must continually develop new and improved products to compete effectively and to meet evolving regulatory standards in all of our major product lines. AAON self-sponsors our Research and Development activities, rather than relying on customer sponsored R&D. \nResearch and development activities have \ninvolved the RQ, RN, and RZ (rooftop units), F1, H3, SA, V3, and M2 (air handling units), LF (chillers), CB and CF (condensing units), SA and SB (self-contained units), and WH and WV (water source heat pumps), as well as component evaluation and refinement, development of control systems and new product development. R&D expenses incurred were approximately $16.6 million, $17.4 million, and $14.8 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe Norman Asbjornson Innovation Center \n(NAIC), a research and development laboratory facility that opened in 2019, includes many unique \nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n10", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAON_2021.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
