{"page_content": "We purchase certain components, fabricate \nsheet metal and tubing, and assemble and test the finished products. Our primary finished products consist of a single unit system containing heating and cooling in a self-contained cabinet, referred to in the industry as \u201cunitary products\u201d. Our other finished products are chillers, coils, air handling units, condensing units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, rooftop units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, and controls. \nWe offer three groups of rooftop units: the RQ-\nSeries, consisting of five cooling sizes ranging from two to six tons; the RN-Series, offered in 28 cooling sizes ranging from six to 140 tons; and the RZ-Series, which is offered in 15 cooling sizes ranging from 45 to 261 tons. \nWe also offer the SA, SB, and M2-Series as \nindoor packaged, water-cooled, or geothermal/water-source heat pump self-contained units with cooling capacities of three to 70 tons. Our small packaged geothermal/water-source heat pump units consist of the WH-Series horizontal configuration and WV-Series vertical configuration, from one-half to 12 1/2 tons, with options specifically for the replacement market and the new construction market. The replacement systems are designed to be compatible with most competitor water-source heat pump models. \nWe manufacture an LF-Series air-cooled chiller \ncovering a range of four to 55 tons. We offer two groups of condensing units: the CB-Series, two to five tons, and the CF-Series, two to 70 tons. Our air handling units consist of the indoor F1, H3, and V3-Series and the modular M2-Series, along with air handling unit configurations of the RQ, RN, RZ, and SA-Series units.\n14", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAON_2021.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
