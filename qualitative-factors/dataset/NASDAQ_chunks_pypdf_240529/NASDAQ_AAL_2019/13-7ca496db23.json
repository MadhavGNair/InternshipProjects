{"page_content": "Community Connectivity and Climate Change\nConnectivity is at the heart of American\u2019s purpose and value proposition, \nand our regional carriers are an integral part of that. In 2019, approximately \n59 million passengers boarded our regional carriers\u2019 aircraft, more than \n40% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. \nThis is precisely the kind of connectivity that our hub-and-spoke network \nis designed to facilitate: Through our regional carriers, we serve smaller \ncommunities and low-density markets that don\u2019t have the passenger \ntraffic to support larger, mainline aircraft. Then, through our hub airports \nacross the United States and our international gateways, we connect \nthose passengers to destinations around the world. In fact, American \nprovided small communities nearly 60% more one-stop connection \noptions than other U.S. network carriers in 2019.2 Thanks to the power  \nof our network, we connect more people to more places.We believe deeply in the value of connectivity. Commercial air service not \nonly expands horizons and connects people, it also provides significant \neconomic opportunity for local communities. \nBut shorter flights on smaller planes come at a fuel-efficiency cost. The \ntakeoff and climb phases of a flight burn more fuel than the cruising phase, \nwhich makes shorter regional flights less fuel efficient than long-haul flights. \nIn addition, when we were building out our regional fleet, the advancements \nin aircraft and engine design that have improved the fuel efficiency of our \nmainline fleet were not \u2014 and sometimes still aren\u2019t \u2014 available on smaller \naircraft. Altogether, the result is that for each mile we fly a passenger or unit of \ncargo, regional aircraft are on average less fuel efficient than mainline aircraft. \nOur commitment to providing industry-leading regional service makes it \nmore challenging for us to meet our fuel-efficiency targets. By appropriately \nbalancing our climate change goals with our commitment to connectivity, \nwe believe we can best help the communities we serve to thrive. \n2.
