Rising temperatures will \naffect how people live and how industries operate, including airlines. \nExtreme heat affects aircraft in several ways. Hotter air is less dense than cooler air, meaning higher \ntemperatures result in less lift and require more engine thrust for planes to take off. Hotter, thinner air \nalso reduces engine output. While most aircraft can operate in very high temperatures (generally up \nto 126\u00b0 F), doing so depends on a variety of factors \u2014 such as airport infrastructure and altitude \u2014 and \nrequires making operational changes. And, smaller regional aircraft typically have lower maximum \ntemperature thresholds. \nConstructing longer runways, which can accommodate the higher speeds needed to attain the altitude \nrequired by the flight path, is one way to enable planes to take off in hotter weather. A more immediate \nway is to reduce aircraft weight \u2014 thereby reducing the thrust required to take off \u2014 by limiting the \nnumber of passengers or the amount of cargo. On a typical American flight from Phoenix to New York,  \nfor example, we can fly with all the seats filled when it\u2019s 100\u00b0 F. But if the temperature goes up to 110\u00b0 F,  \nthe flight\u2019s capacity goes down by six seats \u2014 and if it rises to 120\u00b0 F, we may have to reduce our maximum \ncapacity by as many as 35 seats. \nIncreases in the number of hot days can cause heat buckling on runways and taxiways and other infra -\nstructure damage. And in extreme cases, it may become difficult to cool the aircraft to an acceptable \ntemperature for customers and crew.\nAs part of our analysis of climate-related risks, we have identified which of our key sites face risks from \nincreased temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events in the short, medium and long terms. \nAnd we are exploring strategies for mitigating those risks, such as making schedule changes to have \nmore flights depart during cooler times of day at certain times of year and implementing new health and \nsafety procedures for our team members. \nAmerican Airlines 2019\u20132020 ESG Report\n26CEO Message Strategy Safety Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB Data Climate", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2019.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
