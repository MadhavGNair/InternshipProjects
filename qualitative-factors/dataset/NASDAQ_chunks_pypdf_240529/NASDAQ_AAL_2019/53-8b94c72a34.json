The new \nMBR captures total lost, delayed or damaged baggage reports, divided by 1,000 checked bags; the previous rate was calculated per 1,000 \npassengers. We cannot recalculate prior years using the new methodology and thus are reporting 2019 data only, which is combined for mainline \nand regional domestic flights.\nAmerican Airlines 2019\u20132020 ESG Report\n53CEO Message Strategy Climate Safety Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB Data", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2019.pdf", "page": 53, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
