{"page_content": "Our Strategy\nAmerican\u2019s strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \nis focused on driving operational and technical improvements that \nreduce GHG emissions by continuously improving fuel efficiency \nand substituting petroleum-based fuels with lower-carbon alter -\nnatives. We also expect to rely on market-based mechanisms, \nincluding carbon offsets, certainly over the short to medium terms \nand potentially over the long term as well, depending on how \nquickly the market for sustainable aviation fuel develops. In parallel, \nwe are helping to facilitate the broader policy, market, infrastructure and technological advances needed to enable the transition to \nlow-carbon aviation. \nWe are targeting our efforts where we can have the most mean -\ningful near-term impact in reducing our carbon footprint and  \nmitigating our most significant climate-related risks (see Identifying \nand Assessing Climate-Related Risks, p. 20). The following outlines \nthe key components of our climate strategy.  \nAircraft Fuel Efficiency\nJet fuel consumption is the chief source of our direct GHG emissions \nand one of the largest categories of expense for our company. As \na result, maximizing the fuel efficiency of our aircraft is both a core \nfocus of our climate change strategy and a key business objective. \nOver the past several years, American has undertaken the most exten -\nsive fleet renewal effort in the history of our industry. Since 2013, we \nhave taken delivery of 550 new, more fuel-efficient aircraft \u2014 at a cost \nof $23 billion \u2014 including the Boeing 787 and the Airbus 321neo, which \nwere developed with the latest engine and airframe technologies.  /gid00131/gid00135/gid00131/gid00139/gid00131\n/gid00133/gid00131/gid00136/gid00131 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00135/gid00137 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00133/gid00137 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00134/gid00131 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00134/gid00135 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00134/gid00139 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00135/gid00133 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00133/gid00133/gid00014/gid00036/gid00039/gid00039/gid00036/gid00042/gid00041/gid00046/gid00001/gid00042/gid00033/gid00001/gid00040/gid00032/gid00047/gid00045/gid00036/gid00030/gid00001/gid00047/gid00042/gid00041/gid00046/gid00001/gid00042/gid00033/gid00001/gid00004/gid00016/gid00133/gid00032Getting to Net Zero in 2050: American\u2019s Initial Pathway\n Business-as-usual CO2e emissions\n  Flight operations and efficiency\n  Fleet renewal\n  Next-generation aircraft\n  Air traffic control modernization\n  Sustainable aviation fuel\n  Market-based solutions\n GHG goalLEVERS THAT WE CONTROL\n \u2022Flight operations and efficiency\n \u2022Fleet renewal\nLEVERS UNDER THE CONTROL OF \nOTHERS (GOVERNMENTS, OTHER  \nINDUSTRIES) \n \u2022Next-generation aircraft\n \u2022Air traffic control modernization\n \u2022Sustainable aviation fuel\nMARKET-BASED MEASURES\n \u2022CORSIA\n \u2022Voluntary carbon offsets\nAmerican Airlines 2019\u20132020 ESG Report\n14CEO Message Strategy Safety Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB Data Climate", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2019.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
