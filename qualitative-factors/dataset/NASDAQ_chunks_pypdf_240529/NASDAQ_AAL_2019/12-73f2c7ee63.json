The less fuel needed per RTM, the \nmore efficient the flight. Consistent with the industry\u2019s goal, we set a \ntarget to improve our fuel efficiency by an average of 1.5% annually \u2014 \nor 9% cumulatively \u2014 from 2014 to 2020.\nWhile we were just shy of achieving our cumulative goal of a 7.5% \nimprovement by year-end 2019 in our mainline operations, improving \nefficiency in our regional operations has been more challenging. In \n2019, we achieved a 2% efficiency improvement in our regional opera -\ntions, but our cumulative improvement since 2014 is 1.6%. Collectively, \nour mainline and regional operations have achieved a 5.3% efficiency \nimprovement since 2014. \nAbsolute Emissions\nIn 2019, our Scope 1 emissions were up 2% compared with 2018. \nSince 2005, however, we have reduced our systemwide Scope 1 \nemissions by 8% due to improved fuel efficiency, while increasing  \nthe number of passengers and amount of cargo we carried. \nThe increase in emissions in 2019 was driven by growth in our network, \nparticularly by our regional carriers. Emissions from our mainline oper -\nations increased 0.6% from 2018 to 2019, whereas emissions from our \nwholly owned regional carriers were up nearly 15% as they flew almost \n75,000 additional flights and added seven new destinations to our route \nmap. While only about 12% of our total emissions came from these \nwholly owned regional carriers, they were the fastest-growing part \nof our network, and regional aircraft are on average less fuel efficient \nper ton mile than mainline aircraft (see Community Connectivity and \nClimate Change on p. 13). \nOur Scope 2 (location-based) emissions decreased by 10% in 2019 \nbecause we were able to lower the carbon intensity of the electric \npower we purchased. Our Scope 3 emissions increased by 2% in  \n2019 compared to the prior year.Fuel-Efficiency Performance\nEmissions Avoided Due to Fuel-Efficiency Improvements/gid00183/gid00139/gid00332/gid00183/gid00137/gid00332/gid00183/gid00135/gid00332/gid00183/gid00133/gid00332/gid00131/gid00332/gid00133/gid00332\n/gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00140 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00139 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00138 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00137 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00136 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00135/gid00004/gid00035/gid00028/gid00041/gid00034/gid00032/gid00001/gid00036/gid00041/gid00001/gid00032/gid00040/gid00036/gid00046/gid00046/gid00036/gid00042/gid00041/gid00046/gid00001/gid00043/gid00032/gid00045/gid00001/gid00045/gid00032/gid00049/gid00032/gid00041/gid00048/gid00032/gid00183/gid00047/gid00042/gid00041/gid00183/gid00040/gid00036/gid00039/gid00032/gid00046/gid00001/gid00187/gid00019/gid00021/gid00014/gid00188/gid00001/gid00001PERFORMANCE\nGOAL\nAmerican Airlines 2019\u20132020 ESG Report\n12CEO Message Strategy Safety Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB Data Climate", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2019.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
