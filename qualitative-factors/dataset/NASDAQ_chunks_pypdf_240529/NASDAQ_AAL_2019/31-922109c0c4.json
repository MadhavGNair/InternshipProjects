{"page_content": "Safety Governance and  \nManagement\nAn uncompromising commitment to safety, security and continuous \nimprovement is a shared responsibility \u2014 from our Board of Directors \nto frontline team members. \nOur Chief Executive Officer retains ultimate responsibility and \nauthority for safety performance, and our Board of Directors receives \nmonthly updates on key safety performance metrics. In July 2020, we \nupdated the charter for the Board of Directors\u2019 Corporate Governance \nand Public Responsibility Committee to include safety as one of its \nformal oversight responsibilities. That committee will review quarterly \npresentations from management on our safety performance and will \nalso receive the same monthly updates that management receives. \nThe safety of our customers and team members is guided by our \nSafety Management System (SMS), an organizationwide approach \nto managing risk and assuring the safety of our operations and team \nmembers. Our SMS emphasizes safety management as a funda -\nmental business process to be considered in the same manner as \nother aspects of business management. It involves a full commitment \nfrom the most senior levels of our company through to each team \nmember to integrate safety into all parts of how we do our jobs. Our SMS promotes a culture in which our team members proactively \nidentify, analyze and mitigate risks throughout all aspects of our \noperations. The SMS ensures robust and repeatable processes driven \nby data to reduce risks and continuously improve and enhance safety \nfor our customers and team members. We collaborate closely with the \nFAA to maintain operational safety at the highest level possible and \nactively share best practices with our industry peers, governments \nand aerospace manufacturers.\nSafety Policy\nOur Corporate Safety Policy applies to all team members, business \npartners, contractors and consultants, and it sets American\u2019s safety \nobjectives and standards and assigns responsibilities for safety \nacross our organization.

The Safety Policy complies with all applicable regula -\ntory requirements and laws in the countries in which we operate  \nand establishes standards for acceptable operational behaviors. \nSafety Assurance\nThe Safety Assurance component of our SMS outlines how we use \ndata collection and conduct quality assurance and internal oversight \nto validate the effectiveness of risk controls and the performance of \nthe SMS.
