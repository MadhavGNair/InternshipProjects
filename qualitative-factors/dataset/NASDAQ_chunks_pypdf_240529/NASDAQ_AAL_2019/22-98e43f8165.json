They could also mandate new technologies \nthat would impose significant capital and operating costs on \nus to meet those requirements.We are developing a robust and multifaceted long-term climate \nchange strategy aimed at driving progress toward ambitious goals \nand positioning our company to be a leader on sustainability. \nWe monitor emerging regulations around the world to understand  \nthe risks and opportunities for our business. And we work with \npolicymakers to identify policy solutions that can help the aviation \nindustry reduce its emissions through new technologies. We also \ncontinue to advocate for CORSIA as the single global approach to \naddressing emissions from international aviation. \nWe continue to seek efficiency gains in our operations, pursue \nopportunities to employ SAF and seek to employ lower-emission \nor zero-emission technologies as they become available on a \ncommercially reasonable basis.\nTechnology The risk from emerging tech -\nnologies aimed at supporting \nthe global low-carbon transi -\ntion. This might include:\n \u2022Substitution of existing \nproducts and services with \nlower-emission options\n \u2022Upfront costs to transition to \nlower-emission technology Recent completion of our fleet renewal program gives us \nthe youngest fleet among U.S. network carriers; however, \nmore aggressive emission constraints imposed in the \nnear to medium term may place us at a disadvantage to \ncompetitors who are beginning to upgrade their fleets to \nthe most recent generation of aircraft.\nThere is a risk that technology does not develop suffi -\nciently to allow us to meet our ambitious climate goals.Since 2013, we have undertaken an extensive fleet replacement initia -\ntive, taking delivery of 550 new, more fuel-efficient aircraft, including \nthe Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus 321neo, which are among \nthe most fuel-efficient aircraft on the market. Over the same period, \nwe retired a similar number of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. \nWe will continue to engage with SAF producers and airframe and \naircraft engine manufacturers to better understand new low-carbon \ntechnologies that may become available over our planning horizon.\nMarket The risk from shifting supply \nand demand as economies \nreact to climate change. This \nmight include:\n \u2022Changing customer behavior\n \u2022Uncertainty in market signals\n \u2022Increased cost of raw \nmaterialsBusiness customers may choose to use alternatives to \ntravel, such as virtual meetings and workspaces.\nThe collateral we use to secure loans \u2014 in the form of \naircraft, spare parts and airport slots \u2014 could lose value \nas customer demand shifts and economies move to \nlow-carbon alternatives.\nGreater development of high-speed rail in markets now \nserved by short-haul flights could provide passengers \nwith lower-carbon alternatives to flying with us.We recently introduced a carbon offsetting opportunity for our \ncustomers as a way to enable to them to travel efficiently while \nalso offsetting the GHG impact of their flights. We intend to further \nintegrate other sustainability practices into the products, services \nand experiences we offer our customers. \nWe will deepen our customer relationships by partnering with a range \nof stakeholders, including governments, manufacturers, suppliers and \ncustomers, on sustainability initiatives that have the potential to boost \nlow-carbon pathways, such as sustainable aviation fuels.Timeline Short Term Medium Term Long Term\nPhysical Risks 2020 2035 2060\nTransition Risks and Opportunities 0\u20132 Years 2\u201315 years 15\u201330 years\nAmerican Airlines 2019\u20132020 ESG Report\n22CEO Message Strategy Safety Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB Data Climate", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2019.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
