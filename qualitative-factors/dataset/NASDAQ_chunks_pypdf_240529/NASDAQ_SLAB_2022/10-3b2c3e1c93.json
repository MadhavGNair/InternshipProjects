As a result, \na new requirement for rooftop solar PV \nsystems was introduced and went into \neffect in 2020, requiring a reduced volt -\nage \u2014 below 30VDC in less than 30 sec -\nonds \u2014 in case of a rapid shutdown.\nTigo needed a feature-rich, multipro -\ntocol SoC platform to ensure robust, \nlong-range wireless connectivity for a \nfire safety product line that could gen -\nerate rapid shutdown signals, and meet \nthe US NEC Rapid Shutdown  safety code \nfor first responders.Designed to increase processing capa -\nbility, Tigo employed the BG21 SoCs , \nwith its rich analog and digital periph -\nerals, powerful memory options, and a \nrobust Bluetooth Low Energy radio with \nexcellent receive sensitivity.\nThe result was a resilient, high-through -\nput digital twin of individual PV solar \nsites with long-range connectivity in \nharsh environments for emergency \nstop switching by automatically detect -\ning faults and facilitating communication \nwith the cloud for historical data logging \nand advanced analytics.\nImproving Fire Safety \nReducing voltage below  \n30VDC in less than 30 seconds \nto support rapid shutdown \nAppendix Ensuring Ethical &  \nResponsible GovernanceAdvancing Responsible &  \nSustainable OperationsFostering a Culture  \nof InnovationEnabling a More  \nSustainable World", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SLAB_2022.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
