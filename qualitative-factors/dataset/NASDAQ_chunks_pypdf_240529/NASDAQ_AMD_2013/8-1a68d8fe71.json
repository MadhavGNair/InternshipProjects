Participants have \nenjoyed approximately 10,000 charging \nsessions, saving 30,000 liters of \nfuel and 27,000 kg of associated \nemissions. In 2014, we are increasing \nour EV infrastructure by 40%, including \ninstalling EV charging stations at \nour Markham, Ontario campus.\nIn March 2014, AMD expanded our \ncommitment to electric vehicle \ndeployment by becoming a partner \nin the US Department of Energy\u2019s \nWorkplace Charging Challenge.AMD\u2019s LEED certified data center \nnear Atlanta, GA is more than a green \nbuilding; not only does it use 100% \nrenewable energy, it\u2019s a demonstration \nof how AMD utilizes cloud computing \nand IT strategies to minimize power and \nspace requirements for data centers. \nAMD\u2019s data center consolidation \nproject compressed rack space by \n45% and virtualized servers. The \ncorresponding result was a reduction \nfrom a 2.8 megawatt data center in \nAustin, TX to a 1.2 megawatt facility \nin Atlanta, GA thereby avoiding 10 \ngigawatt hours in electricity, 4,700 \nmetric tons in CO2 emissions and \n$730K in electricity costs annually.\nCHARGING-UP  \nOUR EMPLOYEESAMD\u2019S LEAN AND  \nGREEN DATA CENTER AMD\u2019S\nMANUFACTURING SITESNote: Percentage changes compare  \n2013 values to the 2009 baseline.\nRodney Ahart  \nExecutive Director, Keep Austin Beautiful2013 Environmental Results:\nFinalist \u2013 Green Event CategoryAMD operates manufacturing sites in \nPenang, Malaysia and Suzhou, China and \nhas established specific environmental \ngoals for these sites within the context \nof their operations.
