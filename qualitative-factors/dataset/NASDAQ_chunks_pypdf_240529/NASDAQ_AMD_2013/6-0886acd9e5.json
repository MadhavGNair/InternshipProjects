The operation phase is \nparticularly important because it \noffers a major opportunity to reduce \npower consumption and associated \ngreenhouse gas emissions.AMD\u2019s APUs are a technology \nbreakthrough that utilize the \ncapabilities of the CPU and GPU on \na single chip. This heterogeneous \napproach accelerates processing  \nand delivers dramatic improvements \nin energy efficiency.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy and AMD are working together to develop the \nnext generation of energy efficient supercomputers to fuel scientific discoveries \nin medicine, alternative energy, climate science and other areas of innovation.The era of Surround Computing is \nbringing more intelligent, connected \ndevices to our daily lives that anticipate \nour needs and enable realistic, natural \nexperiences. As an increasing number \nof these devices are plugged in and \nconnected to the Internet, more data is being generated, which in turn increases \npower consumption to process and store \nthe data. AMD is helping to address this \nissue by curbing power consumption at \nmultiple points, from the data center  \nto a wide range of embedded and mobile \nclient devices.Supercomputers are being used by \nscientists to help advance research in \nhealthcare and climate change, and \nto optimize clean energy technologies \naround the world. In the past, \nsupercomputers were all about being fast, not energy efficient. Today, \nAMD and our partners are making \nsupercomputers that are not only \nbeing used for advanced research on \nimportant environmental issues; but are \nbeing recognized as energy-efficient.\nClose to 70% of the power used in \nservers can come from components \nbeyond the microprocessor.  AMD\u2019s \nFreedom FabricTM eliminates tiers of \nnetworking equipment and thousands \nof cables, resulting in energy and \ncost savings in the data center. \nFor example, Livestream allows \nmore than 30 million people to watch thousands of online events each \nmonth. To implement an infrastructure \nthat would scale with its business \nwhile staying within constraints on \navailable power that limit the number \nof servers in their data center, the \ncompany selected AMD\u2019s SeaMicro \nSM15000TM high density servers.\n13\nAMD\u2019s Mullins APU for notebooks  \nand tablets uses 50% less power  \nthan our previous generation APU. The Green500 ranks the most  \nenergy-efficient supercomputers in \nthe world. In 2013, a supercomputer \n(SANAM), using the AMD FirePro\u2122 \nS10000 GPU accelerators, was ranked \n4th in the world on the Green500 list. \n\u201cSeaMicro technology \u2026 allows [Livestream] \nto reduce power consumption and the \nresulting cost savings go straight to our \nbottom line. The SeaMicro SM15000 \nserver also allowed us to double our \ncomputing capacity while at the same time \nretire our energy inefficient servers.\u201d3\n   Thomas Bonnin  \nChief Architect, Livestream\n(2) http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2636073\n(3) http://web.amd.com/assets/CustomerReferenceProgramPackage2012/53214A_Livestream_CaseStudy_FINAL.pdf(1) http://www.amd.com/en-us/press-releases/Pages/amd-us-government-computing-2012jul11.aspxAn AMD SeaMicro SM15000 installation can reduce power \nconsumption up to 75 percent versus a traditional server \nimplementation with similar compute capabilities.Energy efficiency is a fundamental design principle for AMD. \nEnergy efficient products extend the battery life for mobile \ndevices, reduce the costs of operating data centers and help \nlessen our collective carbon footprint. As electricity demand \nincreases with the demand for digital technology, AMD is \nrelentlessly focused on designing energy efficient products. \n\u201cThe development of high performance, energy-efficient \nprocessor and memory technologies are critical to \nachieving the Department\u2019s goals and AMD is initiating \ninnovative designs for these components.\u201d1 \n \n    Dr. William J.
