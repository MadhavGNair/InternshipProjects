In India, only 10% of \nhouseholds are equipped with PCs.1  \nTo help reduce the digital divide, the \nUttar Pradesh (UP) state government \nis providing 1.5 million HP notebooks \npowered by AMD APU technology to \neligible students in the region.\nDistribution began in 2013 and the \nproject has led to HP supporting 1,400 \njobs and investments in the set-up and management of over 300 service centers \nin the state.\n\u201cWe consider the Uttar Pradesh \ngovernment\u2019s distribution of 1.5 million \nAPU-powered HP notebooks to students \na model case study on digital inclusion \nand youth empowerment and one of the \nlargest IT projects being undertaken in \nthis space on a global basis.\u201d\nAMD\u2019s SeaMicro servers aided \nresearchers at The Gene Center of \nthe University of Munich (Ludwig \nMaximilians University, or LMU) in \ncreating the world\u2019s first 3D image of \nthe human ribosome by combining \nmore than 800,000 images. The \nfindings advance the understanding of how bacteria ribosomes can be \nbroken down without harming human \nribosomes, similar to the operation of \nsome antibiotics. This could lead to the \ndiscovery of new drugs that are more \neffective and personalized to a person\u2019s \ngenetic profile.The Environmental School Project \nin British Columbia, Canada has a \nrevolutionary approach to teaching\u2014\none that doesn\u2019t rely on desks, chairs, \nblackboards or even a classroom.  \nThe concept is called place-based \neducation in which learning is \nexperiential and happens in context. \nComputers have to provide rugged \nperformance and power efficiency with \nlong battery life per charge, features \ncritical for an outdoor environment and \nlimited access to power outlets.  \nThe school\u2019s choice was the HP 3115m notebook featuring an AMD \nDual-Core 4 E-3005 APU and an \nAMD Radeon\u2122 HD 6310M GPU. \n\u201cWith HP and AMD, all the kids from \ngrades 2-7 have the opportunity to \nuse computers from the school. As \nsoon as they come up with a question, \nthey have the opportunity to get the \ncomputer out of their pack and use it \nfor that purpose. It\u2019s a huge difference \nhaving them available for these kids.\u201dWalking the Walk \u2013 AMD\u2019s private cloud\nIn 2013, AMD completed one of the \nworld\u2019s largest private clouds for \nR&D. By deploying the latest in cloud, \nopen-source software and hardware \nupdates, we were able to reduce the \nnumber of data centers the company \nutilized by 75%. The project reduced \nelectricity use by over 10 gigawatt \nhours resulting in an estimated annual \nsavings of $730K. In addition to the \nelectricity savings, the consolidated systems increased productivity and \nefficiencies for AMD engineers creating \nthe next generation products.\nAMD and Verizon Co-Develop A \nRevolutionary Public Cloud Platform\nUnderstanding that better enterprise \nadoption of public cloud services \ndemands improved performance, \nreliability and security, Verizon \ncollaborated with AMD to develop a \npublic cloud service with unmatched capabilities. The innovations in \ncompute performance, storage \nflexibility and networking are \nsome of the most significant \nadvancements in cloud computing. \n\u201cWe were able to develop a cloud that is \nfaster, lower cost, more secure and more \nreliable than anything that is available  \nin the market today.\u201d2 \n \n     John Considine  \nCTO, Verizon Teremark\nDental Assistance Devices \u2013 3D VirtualizationDental practices are transitioning from \nconventional 2D X-ray film to sleek, \nchair-side monitors that provide 360 \ndegree visualization and other advanced \ngraphics-driven capabilities at the \ntouch of a screen. These devices can \nenhance care and streamline processes \nat every stage of a patient visit, with \nprocedural prompts for dental assistants, \nintraoral cameras for detailed images \nand access to patient data in real time.  \u201cDental assistant devices equipped \nfor multimedia and 3D visualization \nprovide new levels of visual details to \nhelp patients understand diagnosis \nand treatment recommendations. \nAs would be expected, these \ncapabilities require a very high level \nof processing performance.
