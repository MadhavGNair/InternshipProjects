{"page_content": "The National Research Council \n(NRC) report, \u201cSuccessful K-12 STEM \nEducation: Identifying Effective \nApproaches in Science, Technology, \nEngineering and Mathematics,\u201d asserts \nthat science, technology, engineering \nand math (STEM) subjects are basic \naspects of our lives as citizens, \nconsumers, parents and workers.\nBased on this assertion, it is important \nfor today\u2019s youth to improve their  \nSTEM skills, yet the data show that \nthere just aren\u2019t enough students \ntaking an interest in STEM learning. \nPerhaps this would change if they \nunderstood some of the real-world \napplications of STEM subjects. Here are some telling statistics: In its \nlatest report, Indiana University\u2019s High \nSchool Survey of Student Engagement \nfound that 65% of students are bored \n\u201cat least every day in class.\u201d Yet \nthose same students who are tuning \nout in school are tuning in to video \ngames, with an estimated 97% of \nU.S. teens playing online games. \nThat\u2019s where AMD Changing the Game \ncomes in: our signature education \ninitiative designed to inspire kids to \nlearn by creating video games around \nsocial issues. AMD Changing the Game \nuses this passion for gaming as leverage \nfor learning. But instead of playing \nvideo games, our program teaches kids how to create them. Through game \ncreation, students learn STEM skills, \nas well as problem solving, critical \nthinking, language skills and teamwork. \nBy using age and skill appropriate \ntools, the program helps educators \nguide students through the creative \nprocess and teaches the mechanics \nof game design and production. And \nthese are not the violent games \nthat can worry many adults; the \ncurriculum focuses on developing \ngames around important social \nissues \u2013 such as energy conservation, \nhealthcare and reducing poverty.\nNational STEM  \nVideo Game Challenge\nRecognizing the need to make learning \nboth more engaging and productive, \nAMD teamed up with the Joan Ganz \nCooney Center for the 3rd consecutive \nyear to co-sponsor the U.S. National \nSTEM Video Game Challenge with \nMicrosoft and the Entertainment \nSoftware Association. Inspired by President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cEducate to \nInnovate Campaign,\u201d the National STEM \nVideo Game Challenge aims to motivate \ninterest in STEM among students \nin grades 5-12 by tapping into their \nenthusiasm for playing and making  \nvideo games.\nIn 2013, nearly 4,000 middle school  \nand high school students submitted \nvideo games to the Challenge, many of \nwhich were more complex, challenging \nand creative than in previous years.\nThe competition provides a creative and \ninnovative approach to STEM learning \nthat parallels our signature education \ninitiative, AMD Changing the Game. \nBoth enable youth to develop their \nown games focused on social issues \nand make STEM learning engaging. \nEach winner received an AMD-based \nnotebook computer with game design \nand educational software, and a cash \nprize was awarded to the individual\u2019s \nor team\u2019s sponsor organization. \nAMD Foundation was named as a 2012 and 2013 Laureate of the International Data Group\u2019s \n(IDG) Computerworld Honors Program for the use of technology to promote and advance \nSTEM skills of youth around the world. The annual award program distinguishes organizations \nand companies that use technology to support and create positive social, economic and \neducational change. The AMD Foundation does this through AMD Changing the Game.INSPIRING TOMORROW\u2019S INNOVATORS \n9 8\nSince 2008:  \n \nMore Than 265,000 Students \nReached Worldwide\nOver 40,000 Games Created\n31 Unique Partners\nOver $5 Million  \nin AMD Foundation DonationsAMD Changing the Game\nSTEM Education Investments\n\u201cAMD has been a real pioneer \nin empowering youth through \ngame design.
