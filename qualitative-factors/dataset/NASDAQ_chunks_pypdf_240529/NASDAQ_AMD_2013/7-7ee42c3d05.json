{"page_content": "Supplier Responsibility\nThe Democratic Republic of the \nCongo (DRC) has been the site of one \nof the world\u2019s worst humanitarian \ncrises throughout the last decade. \nAn estimated five million people \nhave died as a result of violent \nconflict in the region. Illegal armed \ngroups and some Congolese national \nmilitary units regularly commit \nhuman rights abuses while being \nsupported by the trade of minerals1. \nThe link between the minerals trade and \nconflict in the DRC has spotlighted the \nuse of minerals in everyday products such \nas mobile phones, computers and other \nelectronics. In an effort to break this link, \na provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct requires companies using any of \nfour minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten \nand gold) to track it back to its mine of \norigin. The goal of the law is to reduce or \neliminate funding to the armed groups \ncreating conflict in the DRC.  \n \nAMD is an active participant in the EICC/\nGlobal e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) \nConflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). Utilizing this collaborative approach, \nwe attempt to track these four metals \nthat are in our products to the smelter \nor refiner that produced them. Once we \nhave identified the smelters or refiners \nin our supply chain, we rely upon the \nCFSI Conflict-Free Smelter Program \nto determine whether these materials \nare associated with the conflict.\nIn addition to these efforts, AMD is a \nfounder and supporter of the Public-\nPrivate Alliance (PPA) for Responsible \nMinerals Trade. We have also engaged \nwith U.S. State Department Special \nEnvoy Russ Feingold on helping the DRC \nand other governments in the region \nreduce conflict and improve security. \nThese efforts, combined with tracking \nmaterials through our supply chain, are \naimed at helping to bring lasting peace \nand prosperity to this troubled region. We posted the results of our conflict \nminerals tracking program on our \npublic website in 2013 and regularly \nupdate this disclosure with the most \nrecent results. Our conflict minerals \ndisclosures are available for download \nat www.amd.com/conflictminerals.\n14 15\u201cIt is very helpful in the \noverall solution to conflict \nminerals to have companies \nlike AMD step forward \nto raise awareness about \nand help drive solutions \nto the tragic human rights \nabuses in the DRC.\u201d  STANDARD\nAMD is a long-standing member of \nthe Electronics Industry Citizenship \nCoalition (EICC). We operate according \nto the EICC Code of Conduct, and \nalso follow the Principles of Social \nResponsibility issued by the Institute \nfor Supply Management (ISM). We \nexpect our suppliers to live up to these \nsame standards, and we communicate \nthese expectations in an annual letter.\n  CONFORMANCE\nAMD regularly conducts supplier \nbusiness reviews (SBRs) with \nkey suppliers to assess corporate \nresponsibility expectations and \nperformance. Using the SBR forum \nensures that supplier responsibility \nis a central feature of our business \nrelationships. We screen supplier \nfacilities using EICC-defined risk \nassessment tools and require any \nidentified as high risk to undergo \nindependent third-party audits \nconducted by EICC-approved auditors. \nIn 2013, 100% of AMD\u2019s major supplier \nfacilities completed EICC self-\nassessment questionnaires (SAQs) \nwith no high-risk facilities identified.  COLLABORATION\nWith more than 90 members (as of \nFebruary 2014) representing combined \nannual revenues in excess of $1.7 \ntrillion, the EICC represents a large \nportion of the global IT industry. AMD \nhas long supported the EICC because \nof our strong belief that collaboration \non social responsibility issues is \nthe most efficient and effective \nmeans to drive real improvement \nin the electronics supply chain.\nAMD\u2019s Director of Corporate \nResponsibility, Tim Mohin, was elected \nChairman of the Board for the EICC in \n2013 and re-elected in 2014. As the \nlevel of maturity increases across our \nindustry, workers and environmental \nconditions around the globe will benefit.  WAFER FOUNDRIES\nWafer foundries are a significant \npart of our supply chain from both \na financial perspective as well as an \nenvironmental perspective. For these \nreasons, we have prioritized wafer \nfoundries for additional scrutiny in \nour supplier responsibility program. \nWe conduct quarterly reviews  \nwith Taiwan Semiconductor  \nManufacturing Corporation (TSMC)  \nand GLOBALFOUNDRIES (AMD\u2019s two \nwafer foundry partners) to verify their \nperformance across a broad range of \nissues, including environmental pro -\ntection, worker safety, labor standards, \ngreenhouse gas emissions, energy use, \nwater consumption and work hours.\n  CAPACITY BUILDING\nWhile supplier audits and reviews are \neffective tools for driving conformance \nto the EICC Code, experience has shown \nthat training (or capacity building) can \nenhance the results. Through the EICC, \nAMD suppliers have access to a broad \narray of training on the best practices to \nimprove their social and environmental \nprograms and performance.SOURCING CONFLICT-FREE MINERALS\n(1) General Accounting Office.
