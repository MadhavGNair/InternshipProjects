{"page_content": "6  2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY  REPORTTo Our Stakeholders:\nNever before has energy been so important to society. From homes and businesses to hospitals and airports, communities run \non energy. And while it\u2019s largely invisible, energy supports nearly every aspect of people\u2019s lives \u2014 from food production to education, health care and even our ability to connect with friends and family. Energy helps us achieve our goals. \nMost people take energy for granted because it\u2019s so reliable. The devastating hurricanes last year in Texas, Florida and Puerto \nRico, however, reminded us of the challenges to live without power for a significant period of time. Energy not only powers our lives every day, but it\u2019s the engine that drives our economy and progress across America and around the world.\nAs an energy provider, Xcel Energy drives progress for the communities and customers we serve. And just as they rely on us, \nwe depend on them.\nAs the theme for this year\u2019s report describes, we have a vision for where we\u2019re going, Leading the Energy Future. We have set  \na path that provides our customers and communities with a more sustainable, prosperous energy future \u2014 one that ensures  our mutual progress.\nMessage from the CEO", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XEL_2017.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
