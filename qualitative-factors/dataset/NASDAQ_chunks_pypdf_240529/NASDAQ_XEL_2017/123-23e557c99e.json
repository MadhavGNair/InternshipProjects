To serve our customers, we withdraw and safely return billions of gallons of water annually to nearby rivers and  other sources. \nWater conservation and protecting water quality are priorities for us. In the more arid Western and Southwestern regions \nwhere we operate, conserving and managing our water supply is especially important given challenges we face in dry  years and concerns over drought.\nWe are reducing our water use \nby serving customers with a \ncleaner energy mix. In 2017 ,  \n23 percent of our energy came from wind and solar power, \nwhich requires no water to \ngenerate electricity.\nSUPPL Y , QUALITY AND CONSERVATION\nWater Management", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XEL_2017.pdf", "page": 123, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
