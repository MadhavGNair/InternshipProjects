The Bank partners \nwith schools and non-profit organizations to provide \nclasses, and we recently developed new partnerships that allow us to reach young adults as well. One example \nis when Mercantile teamed up with the Youth Transition \nServices at Disability Advocates to provide financial education classes to youth with disabilities so they could \nlearn about goal-setting, budgeting and savings.\u00a0 The \nBank\u2019s volunteers also participated in the employment readiness workshops by assisting students with resume-\nbuilding and mock interviews so the students were better \nprepared for job interviews. Home ownership plays a vital role in not only creating strong and stable communities, but also helps build assets \nand wealth. At Mercantile Bank, we \nbelieve that it is vital for individuals and families to be prepared for the mortgage \napproval process and home ownership. \nMercantile partners with several non-profit organizations to provide first-\ntime homebuyer programs.
