We \nintegrate environmental concerns into our underwriting of \nthermal coal business accounts. Our policy, applicable to \nour global insurance underwriting, outlines five key steps \ndesigned to fully evaluate risk and trigger escalations as \nnecessary for further consideration. These five steps include: \n \u0084Set risk threshold at 30% of an account\u2019s revenues \nderived from thermal coal mining and/or coal power \nproduction.\n \u0084Screen and assess all thermal coal transactions against \nthe risk threshold.\n \u0084Escalate flagged transactions to the appropriate \nescalation committee.\n \u0084Assess transactions further through Environmental \nRisk Oversight Committees (EROCs).\n \u0084Report EROC\u2019s outcomes quarterly to the N&G \nCommittee.\nArctic Energy Exploration/Production and Oil Sands \nExtraction Policies\nIn 2022, our U.K. insurance companies adopted sector-\nspecific guidelines regarding arctic energy exploration \nand production, as well as oil sands mining and surface \nextraction. The policies provide scope and screening \nparameters for the review and escalation referral process for \nthese environmentally sensitive business accounts.2022 Submissions\nSince implementation of our Thermal Coal Policy, we have \ndecreased our underwriting of thermal coal accounts for \nvarious reasons including:\n \u0084Submission had no climate-related transition plan.\n \u0084Insured was benefiting from deforestation.\nThis chart represents our 2022 worldwide escalations, \nincluding global coal escalations (one from our U.S. \nunderwriting group) and nine referrals from our U.K. \nbusiness related to oil sands and arctic energy exploration \nand drilling (all proceeded/bound).
