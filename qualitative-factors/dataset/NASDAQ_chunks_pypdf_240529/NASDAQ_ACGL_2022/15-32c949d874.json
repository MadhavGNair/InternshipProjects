We are committed to the continual improvement of our data collection, \nmanagement and calculation processes. Our 2020 and 2021 GHG emissions were retroactively calculated to reflect improved facility and vendor spend data. Our emissions \nreduction targets are now based on the recalculated 2020 baseline year emissions. As our calculation methodology is refined in future years, our emissions numbers are subject \nto change.
