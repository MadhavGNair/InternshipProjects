{"page_content": "Innovation in networks\nAS A BUSINESS THAT \nEMBODIES THE USE OF \nDIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AS A \nPOWERFUL TOOL TO DRIVE \nCHANGE WE ARE ALWAYS \nRESEARCHING NEW \nINNOVATIONS TO IMPROVE \nOUR OWN NETWORKS  \n \nWe recently trialled Volt-Server\u2019s Digital \nElectricity technology in several different \nuse cases and believe it is a powerful, safe \nand sustainable innovation that presents \nnew opportunities for our business. \nBuilding new network infrastructure is a very \nlengthy process requiring multiple permits, \ndependencies on contractors, civil works and \ndisruptions to communities. Utilising the VoltServer \ntechnology we can deliver power to new places \nefficiently, improving the quality of service delivered \nto end-customers by reducing time and operational \ncosts. This technology is unique in that it uses super \nlow-profile copper cabling to distribute power. When implemented with hybrid cables (Copper \ncores and Fibre optic in a single cable) both \npower and connectivity can be supplied through \na single cable which can be blown using our \nstandard tooling thus mitigating environmental \nimpacts and expediting implementation.\n \nUnlike traditional power solutions the VoltServer \nis completely touch safe; live cables can be \ntouched and cut, and no harm will be incurred. \nThe system achieves this by packetising \nelectricity which enables the system shut \ndown within micro seconds if impedance is \ndetected. Not only does this mitigate health \nand safety concerns, but it enables us to deliver \nhigh-voltage AC and DC currents alongside \nconnectivity. This has huge potential for being \nable to power the smart cities of the future. \nThe system can be monitored remotely giving us \nmore insight over delivery and ensures quicker \nremediation time should something go wrong. \nAdditionally, it measures our energy consumption \nand uses our network trends to constantly learn \nand improve how to manage our energy use and \nsaves energy use by powering off when not in use. \nINTRODUCTION OUR STRATEGY DIGITAL PROGRESS RESPONSIBLE CONNECTIVITY PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n26RESPONSIBLE CONNECTIVITY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2020.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
