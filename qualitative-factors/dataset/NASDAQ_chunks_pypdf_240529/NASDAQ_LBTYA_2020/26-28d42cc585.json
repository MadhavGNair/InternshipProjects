That\u2019s why, in 2020, we \nevaluated our approach to DE&I from top to \nbottom and developed a path forward focused on \nmaking an even more meaningful impact in our \ncompanies and our communities.To demonstrate our commitment and ensure \nwe\u2019re making progress, we appointed Grace Ho, \na long term Liberty Global executive, as our first \nChief DE&I Officer. We also established a new \nDE&I Council  consisting of 17 leaders across our \nfootprint, including our CEO Mike Fries. The Council \nis our engine for collaboration, learning and action.\nWe are making sure that diversity, equity and \ninclusion is embedded into everything we do - \nfrom the products we design, the decisions we \nmake, the communities we operate in as well as \nthe relationships we have with our customers, \nsuppliers and shareholders. We\u2019re dedicated \nto being transparent in our approach as we \ncontinue to learn and question ourselves to create \nsystematic impact.\nOur ambition is to not only inspire our colleagues \nbut also encourage them to be curious and \nlearn more about all aspects of DE&I, including \nLGBTQIA+, race and ethnicity, and neurodiversity. Our leaders are helping to create sustainable, \npositive cultural change across our business so \nthat everyone feels that they can bring their true \nselves to work, every day.\nIn 2021, we\u2019re embedding training and policies \nsuch as anti-discrimination, as well as launching \nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs) aligned to \nthe five pillars of our DE&I strategy . The ERGs \nwill amplify the voice of our communities by \ncreating a safe space for employees to share and \ndiscuss their experiences, as well as ensuring \nour policies and procedures always reflect the \ndifferent needs of Liberty Global people.
