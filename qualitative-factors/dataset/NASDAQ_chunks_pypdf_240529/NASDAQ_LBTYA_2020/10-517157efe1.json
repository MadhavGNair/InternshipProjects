{"page_content": "OUR MATERIAL ISSUES\nWe want to ensure that we \nare constantly focused on the \nmost significant sustainability \nimpacts of our business as \nthey affect our stakeholders \nand communities. \nIn 2019 we conducted a new materiality study to \nensure that our strategic direction continues to \nreflect the changing interests and expectations \nof our business leaders and stakeholders. We \nconsulted stakeholders including customers, \nemployees, investors, policy makers, suppliers, \nindustry associations and non-governmental \norganisations (NGOs) to understand their priorities \nand expectations.\nTo do this, we conducted an analysis of factors  \nthat affect our material impacts including:\u2022 The material priorities generated through \nengagement with local stakeholders in our \noperating companies: Virgin Media, UPC, Telenet \nand VodafoneZiggo;\n\u2022 A peer review of leading telecommunications \ncompanies and the issues they present \nas material for their businesses and their \nassociated social impacts;\n\u2022 General priorities defined by sustainability \nframeworks such as the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting \nStandards Board (SASB);\n\u2022 Material issues identified by Environmental, \nSocial and Governance (ESG) ratings and \nstandards Global E-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) \nmateriality report; and\n\u2022 Identified our business impact on society (ESG) \nwith cross functional team of experts in our \noperations.\nWe, therefore, recognise the top eight topics as key \nimpacts to be addressed by our CR framework and \nstrategy, as well as the focus of our sustainability \nreporting to stakeholders. We will be conducting \na refresh of our materiality in 2021 as the events \nof 2020 might influence some changes to the key \ntopics that are relevant to our businesses.Importance to stakeholders  \nLow\nLow\nBusiness impactHighHigh\nCustomer Health & \nSafetyEnergy \nEfficiency\nElectronic  \nWaste Reduction\nMedia  \nResponsibilityGreenhouse Gas \nEmissions\nSocial Product \nResponsibilityDiversity  \n& Inclusion\nLabour Practices  \n& Human RightsBusiness Ethics\nEnvironmental Product \nSustainability\nSupply Chain Risk \nManagementPrivacy & Data \nSecurity\nTalent Attraction  \n& Development\nCOLOUR KEY: Digital Inclusion Responsible Connectivity Other responsible business issuesGRI 101.1-3, 102.9, 102.46-47, 415.1\nINTRODUCTION OUR STRATEGY DIGITAL PROGRESS RESPONSIBLE CONNECTIVITY PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n11OUR STRATEGY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2020.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
