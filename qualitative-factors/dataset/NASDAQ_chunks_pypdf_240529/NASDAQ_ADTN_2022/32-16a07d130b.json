We encourage an environment where individuality is \nembraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical \nor mental ability, ethnicity, and perspective. In this environment, each employee \nis accepted and respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to \nwork. To this end, we have established an employee-driven Diversity, Equity  \n& Inclusion (DE&I) Council to spearhead our efforts. The DE&I Council is  \ncomprised of employee volunteers who are passionate about DE&I and  \nhow it affects our workforce.\nAdtran has incorporated DE&I into its interview process. Members of the DE&I \nCouncil participate in special interview sessions with potential job candidates \nallowing the candidate to ask questions relating to the corporate culture, DE&I \npractices, and other relevant issues. This enables the candidate to understand \nthe daily practices of the company from an employee perspective. Adtran has \nmade DE&I training available and encourages participation by all employees. \n \nIn addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our board \nof directors concerning skills, experience, gender, race, and ethnicity. Our Board \nof Directors is comprised of nine members, three members are female and three \nmembers are ethnically diverse. Additionally, the board of directors has a diversity \nof skills and experience concerning accounting and finance, management and \nleadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, crisis \nmanagement, risk assessment, industry knowledge, corporate governance,  \nand global markets.\nIn addition to these initiatives, the company promotes DE&I-related days of \nrecognition and holidays to the employees.
