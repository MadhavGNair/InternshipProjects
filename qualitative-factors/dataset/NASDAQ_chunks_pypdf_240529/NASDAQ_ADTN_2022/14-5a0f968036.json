Reduce operating expenses and promote sustainability. The Tennessee \nValley Authority (TVA) and Huntsville Utilities (HU) have implemented rate \nstructure changes and increases over recent years. Adtran recognizes that  \nan effective energy management program can reduce expenses and  \npromote sustainability through more efficient operation of its energy- \nconsuming equipment.\n2. Continuously improve energy efficiency. Adtran developed an Energy \nConservation Measure (ECM) plan with prioritized projects over multiple \nyears. We engaged SAIN Engineering to perform a Level 1 hybrid energy  \naudit to identify additional ECMs and additional HVAC retro- \ncommissioning projects.\n3. Leverage end-of-useful-lifecycle and technology obsolescence.  \nAdtran utilizes a five-year capital expenditure (CAPEX) plan to communicate,  \nprioritize, and implement approved CAPEX projects within corporate budget \nparameters. We have found that a sound energy management program  \ncan help justify CAPEX projects, including those with equipment end-of- \nuseful-lifecycle and technology obsolescence issues. Feasible energy  \nprojects provide both qualitative benefits (e.g., new air conditioning units  \nand lighting retrofits will make the workspace more comfortable for  \nemployees) along with quantitative operating cost, heat load, and  \nmaintenance reduction benefits.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADTN_2022.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
