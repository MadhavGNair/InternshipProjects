We seek to maintain an effective mix \nof technical, financial, operating, and management experience. Our board has \nadopted corporate governance principles to guide the company and the board \non various governance matters, and these principles task the Nominating and \nCorporate Governance Committee of the board with establishing criteria for the \nselection of potential directors, taking into account the attributes of leadership, \nindependence, interpersonal skills, financial acumen, business experience,  \nindustry knowledge, and diversity of viewpoints.\nWe have a long-standing policy of keeping our board relatively small. We also \nbelieve that our board should be comprised predominantly of independent \ndirectors from diverse backgrounds external to the company but should  \nnevertheless include the insight and judgment of our senior management.  \nOur board has no specific requirements regarding diversity but believes that  \nits membership should reflect a diversity of experience, gender, race, ethnicity, \nand age.
