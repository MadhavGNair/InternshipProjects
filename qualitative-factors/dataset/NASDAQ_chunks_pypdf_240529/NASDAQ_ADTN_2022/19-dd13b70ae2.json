This \nsystem is designed to reduce power consumption and operating and mainte-\nnance expenditures by implementing Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs). \nSome of the ECMs adopted by Adtran include:\nLight-Emitting \nDiode Lighting \nRetrofits in  \nManufacturing  \nand Office AreasRetro- \nCommissioning  \nof HVAC Systems \nand Controls Energy Audits  \nby an Energy \nEngineering  \nConsultant Low-Cost  \nand/or  \nNo Cost  \nECMs \nTarget Energy Utilization Index \u2013 65 by 2030   The chart on this page depicts Adtran\u2019s Energy Utilization Index (EUI) from 2005 \nto 2020. Since the baseline was initiated in 2005, EUI has been reduced by 44.3%, \nfrom 134 to 74.6 in 2022. With the assistance of SAIN Engineering Associates, we \nperformed an energy assessment in 2013. At that time, we established a target \nof 82 based on our multi-use facility. We have achieved that goal and have \nadditional projects planned through our energy management program. Based \non this, we have established a new goal of 65 EUI by 2030.\nSince 2005, Adtran has also placed significant focus and resources toward the \ndiversification of its energy mix. As you can see from the chart below, coal which \nwas 57% of the energy mix in 2005 was only 12% in 2021. Coal has been replaced \nby cleaner forms of energy including wind & solar, increased hydroelectric power, \nEE, and increased nuclear energy and natural gas.\nEnergy mix\nHeadquarters Energy Utilization Intensity (EUI) index\nTarget \nEUI 65Since 2005\nbaseline, EUI\nhas reduced \n44.3% \nSince 2005 baseline, EUI \nhas reduced 44.3%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADTN_2022.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
