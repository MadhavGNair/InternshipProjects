To combat this \nissue, the EU has enacted the WEEE directive that addresses the collection and \ntreatment of WEEE as well as establishes targets for WEEE collection, recovery, \nand recycling. \nEach European country has implemented a specific compliance scheme to \naddress the proper handling of electronic and packaging waste. By fulfilling our \nreporting duties (and payments to compliance schemes) Adtran contributes to \nenvironmental protection throughout the EU. \nAdtran partners with the European Advanced Recycling Network in Europe to \ncomply with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. Through \nthis partnership, we provide customers with the ability to return and recycle \nAdtran hardware once it reaches the end of its useful life. \nAdditionally, Adtran uses recycled packaging materials wherever possible,  \nand all packaging materials are recyclable.\nAir emissions\nAdtran has effectively eliminated air emission concerns associated with its  \nmanufacturing processes by utilizing water-based, non-hazardous flux on all \nmanufacturing lines. Additionally, we use Impel filtering system hoods to exhaust \nour manufacturing equipment enabling the greatest air-filtering efficiency.\nWater discharge\nAdtran submits annual reports to governing authorities outlining compliance \nwith water discharge regulations. Our local government inspects annually to \nensure total compliance with these regulations.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADTN_2022.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
