By calculating the Energy Use Intensity (EUI), we can \nmonitor and measure campus energy performance over time, compare the \nperformance of similar buildings, and prioritize energy-related CAPEX projects. \nTo help with this effort, we implemented a metering program that enables us to \nunderstand energy performance across campus. Based on this knowledge,  \nwe have implemented practices that better utilize and conserve energy.An Energy Management Team has been established for our German facilities. \nImmediate action items include moving testbeds to where they are only on \nwhen necessary, and defining energy-reduction targets for 2023 in both Berlin \nand Greifswald. Additionally, we will evaluate if older, power-intensive devices \ncan be replaced by new less power-intensive, or virtualized devices.\nAdtran locations in Huntsville are partnering with TVA as part of its Save It \nForward program. This is a strategic energy management pilot program.  \nAs part of the program, TVA will work directly with Adtran over a two-year  \nperiod conducting workshops, on-site sessions, webinars, and consulting  \nservices. The goal is to increase energy efficiency through low- and no-cost \nenergy conservation measures. As a bonus, Adtran has pledged to reinvest a \nportion of its savings in the local community.\n-22%\n-33%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADTN_2022.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
