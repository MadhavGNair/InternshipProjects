To ensure the \ngreatest safety and compliance, all hazardous waste is hauled and disposed of \nby a licensed hazardous waste transporter.\nLandfill diversion\nAt our Huntsville headquarters, a campus-wide recycling program is in place for \ncorrugated cardboard, wood pallets, and batteries. Materials that cannot be \nrecycled are sent to the Covanta Steam Plant for incineration where the steam \ncreated from that process is sent to neighboring Redstone Arsenal and is used to \nheat and cool many of its buildings. This method of waste disposal is widely rec -\nognized for reducing greenhouse gases \u2013 particularly methane \u2013 by eliminating \nemissions from landfills. The chart below shows the annual tonnage collected by \ncategory and the tonnage diverted due to recycling or incineration. It should be \nnoted that Adtran was the first large company in Cummings Research Park to \nachieve 100% landfill diversion. Adtran is proud to boast 100% landfill diversion.Account description January  \nUS Tons February   \nUS Tons  March \nUS Tons   April \nUS Tons   May \nUS Tons June \nUS Tons  July  \nUS Tons August \nUS TonsSeptember\nUS Tons  October\nUS Tons November    \nUS Tons December     \nUS Tons Monthly    \nAverage Total  \nNorth DC Cardboard 5.1 3.38 3.63 4.36 0 5.43 7.8 4.69 7.91 2.21 4.13 0 4.42 48.64\nSingle Stream South 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nTrash Compactor South Kitchen 2.01 4.93 6.12 4.21 4.72 5.8 4.31 5.88 6.12 3.11 4.95 0 4.74 52.16\nSingle Stream East 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nEast DC Cardboard 1.17 2.12 1.94 2.49 1.67 2.55 3.01 2.68 2.51 1.74 1.41 0 2.12 23.29\nTrash Compactor East Kitchen 1.78 4.69 2.71 2.17 3.39 2.94 2.46 2.34 2.58 2.64 2.96 0 2.79 30.66\nTemporary Trash Compactor 0 0 0 0 2.15 0 2.68 0 0 1.81 0 0 0.66 6.64\nConstruction Trash 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nScrap Electronics 2.43 0 6.85 0 22.69 0 0 0 19.27 0 0 0 5.12 51.24\nShredding 0 0.5 0.7 1.1 0.65 0.5 0.7 0.5 0.6 0 0 0 0.53 5.25\nLighting 0 0 0 0.51 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.05 0.51\nPallet 0 0 24 0 0 24 0 0 24.33 0 0 0 7.23 72.33\nBatteries 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.09 0 0 0 0.01 0.09\nPrinter and Toner Cartridges 0 0 0 0 0 0.07 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.01 0.07\nMetal Scrap Recycling 4.33 0 1.36 0.77 5.1 0 0 0 3.32 0 0 0 1.49 14.87\n16.82 15.62 47.31 15.61 40.37 41.29 20.96 16.09 66.74 11.51 13.45 0 27.8 305.75\nGroup January  \nUS Tons February   \nUS Tons  March \nUS Tons   April \nUS Tons   May \nUS Tons June \nUS Tons  July  \nUS Tons August \nUS TonsSeptember\nUS Tons  October\nUS Tons November    \nUS Tons December     \nUS Tons Monthly    \nAverage YTD\nTotal  \nUS Tons \nCardboard 6.27 5.5 5.57 6.85 1.67 7.98 10.81 7.37 10.42 3.95 5.54 0 6.54 71.93\nSingle Stream 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIncinerated Trash 3.79 9.62 8.83 6.38 10.26 8.74 9.45 8.22 8.7 7.56 7.91 0 8.13 89.46\nConstruction Trash 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nScrap Electronics 2.43 0 6.85 0 22.69 0 0 0 19.27 0 0 0 5.12 51.24\nShredding 0 0.5 0.7 1.1 0.65 0.5 0.7 0.5 0.6 0 0 0 0.53 5.25\nLight Bulbs And Ballast 0 0 0 0.51 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.05 0.51\nPallets 0 0 24 0 0 24 0 0 24.33 0 0 0 7.23 72.33\nBatteries 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.09 0 0 0 0.01 0.09\nPrinter And Toner Cartridges 0 0 0 0 0 0.07 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.01 0.07\nMetal Scrap Recycling 4.33 0 1.36 0.77 5.1 0 0 0 3.32 0 0 0 1.49 14.87\n16.82 15.62 47.31 15.61 40.37 41.29 20.96 16.09 66.74 11.51 13.45 0 27.8 305.75\nMonth January   February    March  April \n  May  June  July  August September  October  November    December    \nLandfill diversion % 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADTN_2022.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
