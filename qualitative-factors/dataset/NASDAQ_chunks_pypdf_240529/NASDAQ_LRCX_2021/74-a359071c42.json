We \nhave two levels of environmental review:\n* The corporate EHS team conducts regular assessments and audits of business risks, standards conformance, regulatory compliance, and management system \neffectiveness across Lam\u2019s locations world-wide\n* Our executive management reviews the findings of these assessments and audits and ensures non-conformances are adequately addressed A significant environmental \naspect of our operations is chemical management, and we take all appropriate measures to keep our chemical operations safe and legally compliant. Our integrated \ninventory system connects real-time inventory to procurement, usage conditions, and regulatory reporting for our chemical users, handlers, and planners. We use this \nsystem to continuously identify and implement safety controls and report the use and treatment of chemicals in accordance with government regulations.\n307-1 Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations The global Lam sites had 25 regulatory agency inspections, including 18  health and safety inspections, and 7 environmental-related inspections.
