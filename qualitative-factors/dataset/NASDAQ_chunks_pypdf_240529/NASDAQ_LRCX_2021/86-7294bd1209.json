DNV did not conduct independent measurement of the energy savings variables. This is a limitation whic h can influence the accuracy of our \nopinion. Finally, the sele ction of different but acceptable measurement techniques, in particular related to the waste and energy savings performance,  may result \nin materially different measurements.  \n \nAssurance Opinion  \nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us  to believe that the information \nand data with in the Report is not fairly stated and has not been prepared, in all material respect s, in accordance with the criteria stated.
