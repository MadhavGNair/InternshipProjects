All matters related to IT security and \ncybersecurity are led by our CISO.\n Information is a critical and essential asset to Ambac\u2019s business and the information security program is designed to \nmaintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems and data. \n Our processes focus on the five steps of industry best practice for cybersecurity: identify, protect, detect, respond, and \nrecover, as set by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n Ambac\u2019s business operations rely on the continuous availability of our computer systems. We maintain and test our \nbusiness continuity plan and report results to senior management and our Board of Directors.
