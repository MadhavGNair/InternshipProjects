CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nCorporate Social Responsibility is an integral part of the fabric of Ambac\u2019s operations. Together with our employees, Ambac \ndrives change inside and outside the workplace.   \n Throughout Ambac\u2019s history, we have made unquestioned integrity a cornerstone of our corporate culture and professional \nrelationships. Fundamental to this commitment is respect for the human rights  and dignity of our employees, suppliers, \nvendors, customers and other business partners.\n Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  is our foundation. We review and update it on an annual basis and recently \naugmented it with an ESG Supplement  and other ESG-related policies and procedures. Anti-bribery/anti-corruption, lobbying \nand political involvement, and whistleblower instructions are just a few of the many topics covered in our Code.\n We believe our talent recruitment and retention successes are driven, in part, by our culture of diversity, equity and \ninclusion; our award-winning  human capital management, health and safety practices; our community volunteering support, \nand our responsible investing practices.\nSee also Ambac responses to related voluntary reporting frameworks.
