One World Trade Center, 41st Floor, New York, NY 10007 ambac.com\nPAGE 9 / 10\nCORPORATE SOCIAL  \nRESPONSIBILITY REPORT\nDECEMBER 2022\n4.3 Cybersecurity Training\nAmbac requires cybersecurity awareness training for all employees at the time of onboarding and for employees and members \nof our Board of Directors on an annual basis. The training is designed to educate employees about cyber risk and help them \nidentify and avoid potential threats. We also regularly test employee awareness through simulated phishing exercises. Ambac \nalso engages third-party consultants to conduct penetration tests and periodic risk assessments to identify any potential \ntechnical security vulnerabilities.\n5.  CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT\nAt Ambac, we take climate change and risk mitigation seriously. We closely monitor potential commercial exposure to \nenvironmental risks, including but not limited to climate change and natural catastrophes. The balance between risk and \nopportunity is an inherent part of being an insurance company and is carefully overseen by our Head of Risk Management, \nexecutive leadership, and Board of Directors. \n Many events, including extreme weather patterns caused by climate change, can have an impact on Ambac\u2019s existing \ninsured exposures. Climate change risk is currently not considered to be a material risk to Ambac, and Ambac does not isolate \nthe effect of climate change on its insured portfolio. As the business continues to transform, climate change risk materiality will \nbe monitored through our risk management process. \n Everspan Group\u2019s actuaries and underwriters consider climate-related catastrophe risks in underwriting and pricing \ndecisions, predominantly on a qualitative basis by considering analytical studies on evolving risks in certain climate-related \ncatastrophe lines of business.  As our business matures, we expect industry tools and our internal processes will incorporate \nsuch factors in a more direct manner. In managing aggregate risk, we purchase substantial reinsurance and monitor exposures \nin key geographic zones and product lines already prone to catastrophic events. Additional underwriting information can be \nfound in our Underwriting Statement .\n The company\u2019s policies and procedures relating to risk assessment and risk management are overseen by its Board \nof Directors. The Board takes an enterprise-wide approach to risk management oversight that is designed to support the \ncompany\u2019s business plans at a level of risk considered reasonable by the Board. \nSee also Ambac responses to related voluntary reporting frameworks.
