{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202045\nEnvironmental Health  \nand SafetyClimate and EnergyThrough cleaner energy, improved \noperational efficiency, and the use \nof more energy-efficient building \nmaterials and equipment at our \nfacilities, Applied Materials is \nworking to meet our commitments \nfor a low-carbon future. \nWhile we expect to see the year\u2019s strong \ndemand and business growth continue \nover the coming decade, we are developing \nstrategies to ensure that our renewable \nenergy projects and other environmental \ninitiatives will position us well for reducing \nScope 1 and Scope 2 CO\u2082e emissions 50% by \n2030. We are also working to quantify our \nScope 3 emissions inventory as we prepare \nto announce Scope 3 targets in 2022 as part \nof our commitments through the Science \nBased T argets initiative (SBTi).Climate Risks\nApplied Materials monitors current and \nemerging climate-related risks on an annual \nbasis. Responsibility for identifying company-\nwide and site-specific risks rests with a \ncore team of global emergency response, \ncrisis management, and business continuity \npersonnel, as well as local Environmental Health \nand Safety & Sustainability (EHS&S) teams \nand facilities teams. Our risk identification, \nmitigation, and management plans help ensure \nour ability to recover quickly from climate-\nrelated events and effectively support our \ncustomers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 operations. \nIn June 2020, we undertook a third-party \nClimate Risk Assessment to identify \nopportunities for improving our management \nof climate-related risks and disclosures in line \nwith recommendations from the T ask Force \non Climate-related Financial Disclosures. \nThe assessment included a physical \nrisk assessment utilizing three different \nRepresentative Concentration Pathways \n(RCPs) illustrating low, moderate, and \nhigh-risk climate change scenarios in three \ndifferent years (2020 baseline, 2030, and \n2050), to show both shorter- and longer-term risks. The assessment determined Applied\u2019s \nrisk exposure across our global operations, \nidentifying our highest-risk assets and \noperations based on various chronic and acute \ngeographical climate hazard indicators. \nThis past year, our U.S. operations \nexperienced some of these climate change \nimpacts firsthand. In California, our facilities \nwere undamaged by 2020\u2019s record-breaking \nwildfire season, but hazardous air quality \nforced us to update our buildings\u2019 air intake \nand filtration to MERV 13 wherever possible \nand distribute N95 masks to our employees. \nIn T exas, the February 2021 winter directly \naffected our manufacturing operations, with \npower grid failures forcing a 5-day shutdown \nat our manufacturing facility.\nIn the coming years, we will perform \nadditional scenario analyses and disclose \nspecific cases in which the analyses have \ninfluenced business strategy and objectives. \nAfter completing our analysis of Scope 3 \nemissions in 2022, we will begin analyzing \ntransitional risks (e.g., shifting asset values, \nhigher costs of doing business, and carbon \nregulation compliance) associated with \nApplied\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy.Climate and Energy\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2020.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
