{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202052\nClimate and Energy\nEnvironmental Health  \nand SafetyWater Management\nAlthough Applied\u2019s operations are \nnot conspicuously high-volume water \nconsumers, we strive to optimize our \nwater use efficiency across our global \noperations. Our R&D labs account for our \nhighest consumption of high-quality fresh \nwater, followed by our manufacturing \noperations, routine use at our offices, and \nlandscape irrigation around our properties. \nIn manufacturing, only a few of our toolsets \nrequire significant water, with others relying \non efficient closed-loop cooling systems. \nIn 2020, our total water withdrawal rose \nby 3.7% over 2019, owing to increased \nproduction and research and development \ndemands. Our use of water for irrigation \npurposes at our facilities fell by nearly 21%.\nFacilities groups are responsible for water \nuse management at specific Applied sites, \nwith oversight from the company\u2019s EHS&S \norganization. Our Managing Director of \nEHS&S is responsible for ensuring that \nwater-related risks and minimization \nopportunities are assessed as appropriate. \nWater reduction is covered under our \nEHS policy and ISO 14001 EHSMS, which call for our business operations \nto identify opportunities and make \ncontinual improvements on environmental \npreservation and natural resource \nconservation, and to meet or exceed all \nrelevant regulatory requirements. \nOur water conservation efforts include:\n \u25a0Water recycling and reuse for \napplications that do not require \npotability, especially cooling and \nlandscape irrigation\n \u25a0Designing water-efficient products, \nfollowing best practices for tool \ndesign and specifications for water \nuse outlined in the SEMI industry \nrequirements\n \u25a0Rainwater collection for use in \nlandscaping or non-production needs \n(at our Singapore Operations Center \nand T ainan Manufacturing Center 2)\n \u25a0Drought-tolerant landscaping and \nsmart irrigation to reduce the number \nof watering days\n2,035 ML\nT otal water  \nwithdrawalGroundwater  \n17 ML\nPurchased  \nmunicipal  \nwater  \n2,017 MLWater Performance \n(ML) CY2020", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2020.pdf", "page": 51, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
