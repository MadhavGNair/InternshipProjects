Where possible, we try to create \nstandardized methodologies that drive reductions across multiple tools.\nAnalysis of tools in the design stage provides design engineers with data on \nthe tool\u2019s projected resource consumption and other environmental impacts, \nallowing improvements before the tool goes into production. Analysis of \nexisting tools supports identification of process efficiency improvements that \nwe can communicate to our customers to boost sustainability performance.\nT o date, our analyses have focused primarily on energy consumption, \nexamining every tool component for potential savings, with a particular \nfocus on components known to be particularly energy-intense (heater chuck, \nchillers, pumps, etc.). These analyses have surfaced insights we\u2019ve used to \ndeploy energy-reduction projects with multiple customers. \nOur analyses to support tool footprint reductions have also yielded real-world \nsuccess, leading to design changes that will shave nearly 20% off the footprint \nof certain tool sets in their next generation.\nAs of mid-2021, we are nearing completion of our first-in-the-industry \nchemical consumption analysis and expect to begin leveraging these results \nfor design and process improvements before year-end.
