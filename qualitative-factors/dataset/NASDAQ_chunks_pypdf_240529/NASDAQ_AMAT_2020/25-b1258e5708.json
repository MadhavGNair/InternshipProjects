But it was during a recent Culture of Inclusion Summit at \nApplied that Karen found a whole new calling. \u201cI have two daughters \nand two sons. Diversity and inclusion is very personal to me,\u201d said \nKaren, a native of Brazil now living in Texas. \u201cI want all my kids to \nhave a future living in a world and working in a company that lets \npeople succeed while being their authentic selves.\u201d In April 2021, \nKaren became the Human Resources Executive Partner for HR at \nApplied. To Karen, the willingness to let employees explore new \npassions and to look beyond a resume to see the whole person \nand the value she or he brings are just two of the many things she \nappreciates about the culture at Applied Materials. \u201cThe company \nwelcomes people the way they are,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I matter\u2014\nthat I belong. I can bring my full self.\u201d \nGrowing a Diverse Workforce\nOver the past four years, Applied Materials has focused on strengthening our strategies for retaining \nand recruiting diverse talent and designing a fully actualized Culture of Inclusion to the benefit of all our \nemployees. During 2020, we made significant progress in strengthening our COI strategy and targets, training \ncommitments, and data disclosure.
