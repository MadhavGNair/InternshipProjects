In addition, we are partnering with \nexisting suppliers to pursue their diversity \ncertifications through the National Minority \nSupplier Diversity Council (NMSDC) and \nWomen\u2019s Business Enterprise National \nCouncil (WBENC). \nBeyond expanding our diverse supplier base, \nwe are also working to integrate equity and \ninclusion across our procurement operations, \nadding resiliency to our supply chain. As \nour supplier diversity initiative grows, we are using the RGMA Five Levels of Supplier \nDiversity framework to measure our progress \nin alignment with other supplier diversity \nprograms. Our near-term objectives include:\n \u25a0Hiring a dedicated mid-level \nprofessional to manage our supplier \ndiversity program\n \u25a0Providing trainings for senior \nexecutives, procurement professionals, \nand commodity business managers\n \u25a0Evaluating opportunities to increase \ndiverse spend within our Tier 1 and Tier \n2 supplier base\n \u25a0Hosting webinars for our suppliers \nto boost their own supplier diversity \nefforts\nOver the long term, we strive to build a \ntrue partnership with our suppliers to drive \ndiversity throughout our supply chain and to \nset a positive example for our industry.Defining Diversity\nApplied Materials\u2019 diverse suppliers must be certified by a third-party \nauditor as being at least 51% diverse owned, controlled, and operated by \nU.S. minorities (African-American/Black, Hispanic/Latin-American, Native \nAmerican, Asian-Pacific American, Asian-Indian American), women, minority \nwomen, LGBTQ, persons with disabilities, veterans, or service-disabled \nveterans. Applied Materials also tracks additional diverse suppliers that \ncould potentially be registered as diverse if they proceed with certification. \nAs a founding member of SEMI\u2019s Manufacturing Ownership Diversity (MOD) \nworking group, Applied Materials is working to provide best practices for \nsupplier diversity in the semiconductor industry.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2020.pdf", "page": 71, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
