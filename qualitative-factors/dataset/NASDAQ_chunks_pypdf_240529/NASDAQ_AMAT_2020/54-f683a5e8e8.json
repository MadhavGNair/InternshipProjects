{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202055\nDesign for Sustainability \nPromoting Circular Economy \nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain ResponsibilityThe core of Applied Materials\u2019 \n2030 sustainability vision is \nour commitment to innovating \ntransformative solutions that \nempower a digital society. As the \nleader in materials engineering \nsolutions used to produce virtually \nevery new chip and advanced \ndisplay in the world, we recognize \nApplied has an exceptional \nopportunity to effect change \nacross the technology industry. \nThroughout 2020 and into 2021, we have \nbeen strengthening our infrastructure to \ntransform our own portfolio and advance our \ncustomers\u2019 roadmaps for a more sustainable \nfuture. We are taking an end-to-end, data-\ndriven approach to identify opportunities \nacross our full network manufacturing, \nlogistics, and supply chain\u2014and focusing \nwhere we can have the greatest impact.Our Design for Sustainability Center of \nExcellence is driving groundbreaking \nsustainability innovation across our product \nlines, resulting in lower consumption and cost \nsavings for both Applied and our customers.\nWe are piloting new packaging solutions \nto reduce weight and waste and increase \nrecyclability, and shifting to intermodal \nshipping, which will significantly decrease the \ncarbon footprint associated with airfreight. \nFollowing the launch of our new Supply Chain \nCertification for Environmental and Social \nSustainability (SuCCESS2030) initiative in July \n2020, we established a SuCCESS2030 Center \nto oversee and support implementation. \nThrough our single and two-layer recyclable \nflexible packaging product innovations, we are \nworking to address one of the world\u2019s largest \ncontributors to ocean pollution and other \nenvironmental degradation: discarded food \nand consumer product packaging. We are \ndeveloping packaging materials that are more \neasily recyclable and working with partners \nto innovate renewable and biodegradable \npaper-based materials that deliver the barrier \nperformance needed to extend product shelf \nlife and reduce food waste. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2020.pdf", "page": 54, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
