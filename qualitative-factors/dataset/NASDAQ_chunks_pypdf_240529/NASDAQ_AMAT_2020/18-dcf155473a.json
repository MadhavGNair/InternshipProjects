With donations matched dollar-for-dollar by the \nApplied Materials Foundation (plus an additional $500,000 \nmatch to help food banks respond to COVID impacts), the \ncampaign raised $4 million, a 70% increase over 2019. This \nfunding provided vital support for 50 nonprofit organizations \nacross the U.S. and Canada as they worked to manage \ndramatically increased demand.\nGlobal Fight Against Hunger efforts continued throughout \nthe year, often aligned with cultural and seasonal holidays \nin different countries. In Israel and China, employees \nvolunteered with local organizations to package food for \ndistribution in their communities. Meanwhile, employees \nin India and T aiwan raised funds to provide access to food \nfor those in need. All these efforts reflect Applied\u2019s values \nand purpose, aligning who we are with what matters to our \nemployees and what\u2019s needed in our communities.

In his first few \nmonths at Applied, Cho got involved with the Austin \nchapter of the Young Professionals Network, an Applied \nEmployee Resource Group.

When the pandemic halted in-person gatherings, \nCho and the other YPN leaders found new and creative \nways to inspire engagement, including supporting the \nlocal community. This year, the Austin-based YPN raised \nover $12,000 through a food drive, which was doubled \nto $24,000 through the Foundation\u2019s donation match \nprogram.
