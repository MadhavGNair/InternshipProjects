While we use recycled content in packaging when it meets \nperformance specifications (e.g., stacking strength, plastic purity), it is infeasible for all applications.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2020.pdf", "page": 56, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
