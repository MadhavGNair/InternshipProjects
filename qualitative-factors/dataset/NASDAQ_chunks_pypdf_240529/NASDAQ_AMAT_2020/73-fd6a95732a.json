We planned and performed our work to obtain all the inf ormation and explanations that we \nbelieve were necessary to provide a basis for our assurance conclusion.  \n \nA multi -disciplinary team of sustainability  and assurance specialists performed a range of assurance procedures which \nvaried across the scope covere d by our assurance engagement , as follows:    \n\uf0b7 A review of internal reporting guidelines, including conversion factors, e stimations and assumptions used and \nreporting systems and controls used;  \n\uf0b7 A walk -through of the systems used for each indicator group (Workforce, Environmental, Health & Safety and \nCommunity Impact data programs);  \n\uf0b7 Interviews with data owners at corporate level (e.g. environmental, social, health & safety and community impact);  \n\uf0b7 An analytical review of 2020 full year data by conducting a y ear-over-year analysis per site for the selected \nindicators  which included testing the completeness and accuracy of data ; \n\uf0b7 Virtual site visits to four countries (Israel, Singapore , Taiwan  and USA ) to understand local reporting processes, \ndata management and reporting;  \n\uf0b7 Desktop review of underlying source data  for site visits and for renewable energy calculations ; \n\uf0b7 A review alignment of indicators with the established reporting criteria;   \n\uf0b7 Virtual he ad office visit to review outcomes of Applied Materials internal QA/QC process \u2013 including changes made \nincluding reviewing changes made to 2020 data following the findings from the  site visits  carried out ; and \n\uf0b7 Reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the Report to ensure consistency \nwith our findings.  \n \nThe limitations of our engagement  \nThe reliability of the assured performance data is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for \ndetermining, calculating or estimating the underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance conclusion in \nthis context. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or as sume responsibility for any third party using or placing reliance on \nour opinion in order to make a decisions related to Applied Materials.  \n \nFor the assurance of the intensity metrics included in the scope of this engagement, ERM CVS has place reliance on  the \nSEC 10K annual filing stated revenue  which has been taken as read .  \n \nPrior to our assurance engagement, travel restrictions were imposed following the outbreak of COVID -19. As a result of \nthese , we agreed to replace in person head office and site visi ts with \u2018virtual\u2019 visits via conference  and video  calls for this \nyear\u2019s assurance engagement. While we believe these changes do not affect ou r limited assurance conclusion above, we \ndraw attention to the possibility that if we had undertaken in person visi ts, we may have identified errors and omissions in the \nassured information that we did not discover through the alternative assurance program.  \n \nOur Observations  \nWe have provided  Applied Materials with a separate Management Report with our detailed findings and recommendations. \nWithout affecting the conclusions presented above, we have the following key observation:  \n\uf0b7 During this engagement, Applied Materials has identified opportunities to improve its global environmental reporting \nprocedures and mana gement of change processes .  \n \n \n  \n \nBeth Wyke  \nPartner, Head of Corporate  Assurance  Services  \n29 June  2021  \n \nERM Certification and Verification Services, London  \nwww.ermcvs.com   Email: post@ermcvs.com\n \nERM CV S is a member of the ERM Group.
