Develop (or update) your RI policy based on the input from the  \nbene\ufb01ciaries and other stakeholders; reference internationally \naccepted standards like the UN Global Compact, OECD \nguidelines, Ruggie Framework.\n4. From a reputational point of view, determine categories \nof activities that the pension fund does not want to be \nassociated with (e.g. controversial weapons, tabacco, \nalcohol, countries that breach human rights). Obtain advice \nfrom your asset manager or a specialized ESG \ufb01rm. Update \nthe exclusions list once a year.\n5. Ask your asset manager about their engagement dialogues \non ESG with the companies they invest in on your behalf. \nYou can also consider setting up an engagement program \nspeci\ufb01cally for your fund.
