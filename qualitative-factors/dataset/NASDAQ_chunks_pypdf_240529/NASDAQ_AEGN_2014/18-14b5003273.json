These engagement activities are \ncoordinated through monthly conference calls.\nThe AAM engagement program is monitored by the Aegon RI Committee; developments in \nengagement dialogues and progress made are a standing agenda item, and decisions on initiation and \ntermination of engagement dialogues are made by the RI Committee. Where possible, AAM seeks to \ndirectly involve portfolio managers and analysts at AAM units in the engagement activities.\nEngagement in 2014\n\u2022 In 2014, AAM engaged with 230 companies on a range of ESG issues.\n\u2022 90% of AAM engagement activities were related to corporate governance matters; 10% were \nrelated to environmental or social issues.\n\u2022 We classify and record our engagement activity as basic, moderate or extensive.Assets under Management by asset class  \n39% Assets under Management by location\nMeetings voted by AAM unit2 Meetings voted per Country \n148\n(13%)\n467\n(41%) \n160\n(14%) 14\n(1%)333\n(29%)19\n(2%)Break-down of votes \nagainst Management Proposals Break-down of votes on \nsupported Shareholder Proposals  \nRoutine/Business  \nDirectors Related  \nCorporate Governance  \nSocial/Human Rights  Compensation  \nGeneral Economic Issues \nHealth/Environment  \nOther/MiscellaneousUnited Kingdom \nUSA \nFrance \nGermany \nNetherlands Switzerland\nSweden \nJapan Belgium\nHong Kong \nRest of World\nRoutine/Business  \nDirectors Related  \nCapitalization \nReorganizations and Mergers Non-Salary Compensation \nAnti-takeover Related AAM CEE\nAAM (NL)Governance\nSocial/Environment\nAAM US\nKames Capital (UK)\nTKP Investments (NL)What did we engage on?

May not have \npursued the issue beyond the initial contact with the company and includes signing letters authored by others.\n  Moderate engagement: more than one interaction with a company on issues identified. The engagement was \nsomewhat systematic, but the specific desired outcome may not have been clear at the outset.\n  Extensive engagement: multiple instances of focused interaction with a company on issues identified with a view \nto changing the company\u2019s behavior. The engagements were systematic and begun with a clear goal in mind.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2014.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
