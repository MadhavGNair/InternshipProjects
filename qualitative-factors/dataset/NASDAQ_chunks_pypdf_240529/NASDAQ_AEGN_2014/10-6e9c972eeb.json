{"page_content": "11Since 2009, when AAM was formed as a separate division within Aegon, we have been \nimplementing the elements of a broad RI framework: global policy development, coordinated \nengagement and voting, integration of ESG risk management and impact investment within \ninvestment management processes, and governance that ensures the representation of the \nrelevant stakeholders.\n \nIn many ways, 2014 was a year of assessment. Having completed a self-assessment process \nand peer benchmark at the start of the year, we employed RI expert Rob Lake to review our RI \nimplementation. Rob interviewed the key Aegon and AAM staff involved in RI, and presented his \nfindings and recommendations to the CEOs of Aegon NV and AAM. \nThe outcome of the assessment is that we have achieved the initial objectives of our RI Framework \nand that Aegon has established a solid foundation for RI, in its many facets. However, we have also \nidentified two broad ambitions for the next phase of implementation: first, to further \u2018formalize \nand embed\u2019 many of the RI initiatives and responsibilities that are now in place. Secondly, to make \neven stronger links between RI and Aegon\u2019s strategy and purpose. (We provide further detail on \nthese ambitions on page 14).\nIn that sense, I feel we are tracking the development of responsible investment more broadly \u2013 \nwhat started out as a niche product is now becoming mainstream, embedded in asset owners\u2019 and \nmanagers\u2019 business models. \nAt AAM we feel privileged to be able to contribute to this transition to a more sustainable financial \nsystem through our investments.\n Harald Walkate\n \n Senior Vice-President, Head of Responsible Investment\n Aegon Asset Management", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2014.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
