Just take, for \nexample, the differences in understanding of carbon \nfootprinting between equities and fixed income. It is far \nmore advanced in the former than the latter, but as a \nsignificant fixed income investor we see a role for AAM in \nhelping to further develop intelligence in this area \u2013 and \nwe are already beginning to do so.

Although your own carbon \nfootprint is modest, as investors you are able to \ninfluence the enterprises in which you invest.
