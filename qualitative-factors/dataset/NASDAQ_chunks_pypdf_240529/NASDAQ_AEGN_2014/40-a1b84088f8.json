As the market develops impact \nmeasurement standards will emerge, but in the meantime \nI would prefer to focus on the evidence of intent.\nWill AAM set targets for green bonds?\nNot immediately \u2013 but this does not mean that we are not \ntreating them with due seriousness. Green bonds will, I \nbelieve, feature in the mix of many investment portfolios in the years ahead. In some cases, they will be specifically \nmandated by our clients, and where that happens, targets \nwill need to be agreed.\nAt this early stage, setting targets would potentially push \ninvestors towards premature decisions, and we do not \nwant to do that. For now, we need, as always, to monitor \ntrend and performance with the care we give to all our \ninvestments. In addition, we will ensure that the projects \nwhich those bonds are used to fund are themselves \nfollowed and communicated. \nGreen bonds exist to make a difference to social, \nenvironmental and business sustainability in the real \nworld, and the best way we can promote their adoption is \nby ensuring that we communicate the actual results. <\nHendrik Tuch\nHendrik Tuch has 14 years\u2019 experience as a portfolio \nmanager and has been with AAM for four years.
