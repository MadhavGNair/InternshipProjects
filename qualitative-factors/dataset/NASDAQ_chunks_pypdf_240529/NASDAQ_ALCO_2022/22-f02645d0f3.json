Workers pick the fruit from \nthe tree and load it into a tractor trailer, where it is transported to \ncustomers who manage quality control and processing. \nWe don\u2019t have storage or processing facilities. We don\u2019t need to \nmaintain refrigeration units to keep our citrus fresh, and we don\u2019t \nhave to worry about food waste. We don\u2019t outsource or use contract \ngrowers to meet any of our production needs. We don\u2019t add any \nfood ingredients to our products. Instead, we focus on growing \nhealthy trees with great quality fruit. It\u2019s that simple.\nWe work closely with customers to understand and meet their social \nand environmental goals. We routinely participate in sustainability \naudits that examine our growing practices, energy and water \nconsumption, fair labor protections, governance and oversight \nmechanisms and food safety protocols. While we do not currently \nparticipate in any third-party product sustainability certifications, \nlike USDA Organic or Fair Trade Certified, it is something we are \nopen to considering, based on customer demand.Indicator Unit FY 2021 FY 2022\nCustomer Retention Percent 100 100\nNotices of violations for regulatory  \nlabeling and/or marketing codesNumber 0 0CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PERFORMANCE", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALCO_2022.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
