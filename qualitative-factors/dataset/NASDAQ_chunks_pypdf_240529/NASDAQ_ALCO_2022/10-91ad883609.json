We interviewed key subject matter experts from around the \ncompany, examined sustainability disclosures from other agriculture \ncompanies and analyzed questionnaires, audits, and inquiries from \ninvestors and customers.\nUsing the SASB Five Factor Test for materiality, we identified \nnine material topics across three workstreams: Environmental \nStewardship, Product Responsibility and Great Place to Work. \nThese nine topics are the most important environmental, social and \ngovernance issues for our business and to our stakeholders.\nIn FY 2022, in preparation for developing this report, we revisited \nand confirmed the relevance of these material topics. In addition \nto guiding our internal sustainability strategy, this framework also \nmaps to this sustainability report, with chapters for each of the major \nworkstreams and separate pages for each material topic.
