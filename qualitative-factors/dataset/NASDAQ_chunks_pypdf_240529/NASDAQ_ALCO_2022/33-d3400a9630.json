It covers our policies, practices and \nperformance data on a range of environmental, social and governance issues \nfor fiscal year 2022 (October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022). Unless \notherwise specified, boundaries are based on operational control, including \nthe grove operations and land operations. It excludes land that has been \nleased to third parties. The previous report was published December 8, \n2021.\nASSURANCE AND VERIFICATION\nWe have engaged Strategic Sustainability Consulting (\u201cSSC\u201d), an \nindependent party, to support our sustainability reporting efforts. We \nbelieve that this report contains information that is accurate, timely, and \nbalanced. In preparing the material for this report, we have completed an \ninternal assessment process in conjunction with SSC to review the contents \nfor clarity, but the report is not externally assured and the data within this \nreport has not been third-party verified.\nRESTATEMENTS\nIn calculating our FY 2022 energy use, we discovered that gasoline and \ndiesel consumption was under counted for FY 2021. We have corrected \nthese values (see page 14) to enable an accurate comparison between FY \n2021 and FY 2022 energy consumption data. We did not update FY 2021 \ncarbon footprint results, and Scope 1 emissions data for stationary and \nmobile combustion remains understated in this report. The overall finding, \nhowever, remains unchanged: Scope 1 \u201cnon-mechanical field management \nemissions\u201d (e.g. fertilizer) is the key driver of our total carbon footprint. \nWe will restate FY 2021 carbon emissions when we next update our carbon \nfootprint. \nFOR MORE INFORMATION\nWe welcome your feedback, comments and questions on this report and \nother ESG matters.\nCarisa Keller\nDirector of Sustainability\n239-266-2000\nalicoesg@alicoinc.comCAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT  \nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning \nof Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section \n21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
