ADI recently released a new \nCode \nof Corporate Social Responsibility , which outlines \nhuman rights requirements for all global workers. In \naddition, a key strategy for protecting human rights at ADI is our active participation in the\n Responsible \nBusiness Alliance  (RBA), the world\u2019s largest industry \ncoalition dedicated to electronics supply chain \nresponsibility. Membership requires that we adopt the \nRBA Code of Conduct , which establishes standards \nto ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry and its supply chains are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. RBA\u2019s audit process is a critical component to our strategy for ensuring the protection of human rights in \nour supply chain . \nRespect for \nHuman Rights \nRespect for human rights is rooted in our values and \napplies wherever we do business. These principles apply to all employees and contingent workers, products and services, as well as our business relationships, including our supply chains. They also align with multiple frameworks including the \nUN Guiding Principles \non Business and Human Rights , ILO Declaration on \nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work  and UN \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights . Our Commitment \nADI is committed to the human rights of all workers and to ensuring that they are treated with respect and dignity and work within humane working conditions. \nAnalog Devices \n\u2022 Stands against discrimination of its workers.
