{"page_content": "ECONOMY GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL ENGAGING WITH IMPACT APPENDICES \nRisk Oversight\nEnterprise Risk \nOversight \nAt ADI, our ESG program and its oversight are closely \naligned with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. Our ERM program defines how we identify, manage and govern risk throughout our organization to promote the achievement of our financial and operational goals in a compliant manner. It assigns accountability for risk management to every business unit, based on the risks they encounter as part of their day-to-day operations. In 2021, we appointed ADI\u2019s first Chief Risk Officer to oversee internal risk management programs in partnership with the senior leadership team. At the management level, the Chief Risk Officer chairs ADI\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management Committee, which oversees risk management on a company-wide basis and enhances our risk oversight practices with quarterly cross-functional committee meetings. \nThe Board\u2019s role in ADI\u2019s risk oversight process includes \nr\neceiving regular reports from members of senior \nmanagement on areas of material risk to ADI. Our Chief Risk Officer provides regular reports to our full Board regarding our management of all enterprise and operational risks and our Enterprise Risk Management program, with periodic updates on focus areas, such as cybersecurity. The Board also receives regular updates from our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which provide our Board with thorough insight about how ADI manages risk.\n 4040", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 40, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
