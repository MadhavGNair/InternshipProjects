{"page_content": "5757 ECONOMY GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL ENGAGING WITH IMPACT APPENDICES \nWorking with \nSuppliers \nWhen ADI onboards a new supplier, they must sign \na document from purchasing confirming their commitment to ethical sourcing and compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct. Our Purchasing Terms and Conditions reinforce this policy with our suppliers. At least twice a year all relevant suppliers are required to complete and submit their sourcing information using the RMI \nConflict Minerals Reporting Template  (CMRT), \na free, standardized reporting template that facilitates \nthe transfer of information through the supply chain regarding mineral country of origin and the smelters and refiners being utilized. The template links to the \u201cRMAP Conformant Smelter List\u201d which facilitates the identification of new smelters and refiners to potentially undergo an audit via the RMI\u2019s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). \nEvery 2 years, certain major ADI suppliers have a validated assessment program (VAP) compliance audit \nconducted by an independent third-party audit firm that has been approved by the RBA. We report to the RBA as part of our compliance requirement on how many of the ADI-owned and supplier facilities have completed the SAQs and if there were any significant findings from any of the audits on those suppliers. \nRMAP uses an independent third-party assessment of smelter/refiner management systems and sourcing practices to validate conformance with\u00a0\nRMAP standards . The assessment employs a risk-based approach to \nvalidate smelters\u2019 company-level management processes for responsible mineral procurement.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
