{"page_content": "ECONOMY GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL ENGAGING WITH IMPACT APPENDICES \nInvesting in Research to Support Sustainability \nTo stay at the forefront of technology innovation, ADI \nis continuously investing in leading research activities that support a sustainable future. These investments span a wide range, from basic scientific explorations to applied research. Some examples include: \n\u2022 UC Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC) \n\u2022 UC Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC) \n\u2022 Stanford System X Alliance \n\u2022 Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES) \n\u2022 NSF Power Management Integration Center \n\u2022 NSF Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) \n\u2022 NSF Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies (ASSIST) \n\u2022 University of Michigan transportation research at MCity \n\u2022 MIT Medical Electronic Device Realization Center (MEDRC) \n\u2022 MIT Center for Quantum Engineering \n\u2022 NSF Center for Hardware and Embedded System Security and Trust (CHEST) \n\u2022 UMass Lowell Printed Electronics Research Collaborative In the past year, ADI has added several new programs to expand in scope. We have: \n\u2022 Partnered in establishing 2021 Semiconductor Research Corporation Multi-Center Joint University Microelectronics Program (JUMP) 2.0 public/ private partnership program that supports high-risk, high-payoff research that addresses existing and emerging challenges in information and communication technologies. \n\u2022 Joined MIT Future Energy Center  to engage \nin transition of energy as new technology and \nunderstand impact on policy, demographic and sustainability. \n\u2022 Engaged with NSF Broadband Wireless Access & \nApplications Center (BWAC) to advance wireless \ntechnologies and provide cost-effective and practical solutions for next-generation (5G & beyond) wireless systems, including millimeter-wave communications and\u00a0wireless cybersecurity. \n\u2022 Joined 2021 MIT Center for\u00a0Transportation and \nLogistics (CTL) to focus on sustainable supply chain \nand green logistics topics. \n\u2022 Become an inaugural member of MIT AI Hardware Program that will define and develop translational \ntechnologies in hardware and software for the AI and quantum age. \nADI programs are designed to nurture the translation of \nbasic research into applied technology, to help educate new generations of scientists and engineers, and to attract new talent to ADI.\u201d \nZORAN ZVONAR, Fellow, Director of University Programs98\n98", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 98, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
