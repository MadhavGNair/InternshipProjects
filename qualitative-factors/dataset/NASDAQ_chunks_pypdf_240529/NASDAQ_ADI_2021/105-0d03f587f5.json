While the contents within this report have not been externally assured, the information and data within has been quality reviewed for completeness and accuracy by management and ADI\u2019s dedicated internal resources. \nIn addition to the UN SDGs, we have considered three key sustainability reporting frameworks as we developed this report: (1) the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, (2) industry-specific standards from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and (3) the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (Core). TCFD, SASB and GRI indices can be found \nhere . \nIn 2021, we continued our commitment to integrated reporting by including environmental, social and governance information in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10K and 2021\u00a0Proxy Statement, available on our \nInvestor Relations website . \nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS \nThis ESG report contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbor created under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other safe harbors \nunder the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
