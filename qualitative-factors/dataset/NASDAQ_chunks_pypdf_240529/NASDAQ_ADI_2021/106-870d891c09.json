Non-manufacturing data was not externally assured at the time of this report\u2019s issuance, but is forthcoming. \n Historically, we have only accounted for emissions generated from manufacturing sites owned or controlled by ADI because they are more resource-intensive compared to our non-manufacturing sites. As \npart of our updated target setting, we have expanded the scope of our emissions inventory to now include both manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites owned or controlled by ADI, covering 100% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. \n*** Value chain emissions are a critical component of understanding our environmental impact. We are inventorying our Scope 3 emissions, and are currently calculating upstream and downstream categories for Legacy ADI and Legacy Maxim. Verified data is forthcoming. \n To view our Assurance Statements click here .106\n106", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 106, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
