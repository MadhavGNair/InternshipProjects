We prioritize on-the-job experiences as a way to build skills and drive learning. 2 \nFocus on Social \nPurpose \nFostering a workplace \nwhere the best minds can come together to engineer good \nThe ADI Foundation is creating a more \nsustainable future through community grants, employee matching gifts for both direct donations and volunteer hours, and in-kind donations. Last year, the Foundation awarded $1.8 million in community grants and $1.4 million was donated through employee giving and Foundation matching. \nIn collaboration with employees, we \nar\ne addressing inequities in STEM \neducation through new partnerships with two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This includes providing 350 engineering kits to facilitate hands-on learning, sponsoring research projects and holding technical talks. 3 \nDrive Engagement \nthrough Employee Experience \nListening and responding \nto employee feedback \nThroughout the year, we conduct \nemployee surveys and listening activities to gain feedback and learn more about the company\u2019s strengths as a workplace and opportunities for improvement.

To support this ambition, we are standardizing our assessment criteria to mitigate bias and tailoring development programs to meet the needs of our underrepresented populations. 5 \nBuild the \nWorkforce of the Future \nEvolving our workforce \nskills to drive innovation and sustain a competitive advantage \nOur engineering team members \ndesigned and implemented a Software Engineering Reskilling Program, specifically designed to address ADI\u2019s evolving talent needs by expanding the skills of our technical workforce in the software domain. \nWe are committed to employee \ngr\nowth and development, as well as \nbuilding high-performing teams. This includes providing essential training such as the Executive Leadership Program and Management Essentials curricula that prepare employees to lead teams today and grow the business tomorrow.73", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 73, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
