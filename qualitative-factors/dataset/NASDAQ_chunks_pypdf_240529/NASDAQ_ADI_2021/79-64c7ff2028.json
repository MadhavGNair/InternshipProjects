{"page_content": "ECONOMY GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL ENGAGING WITH IMPACT APPENDICES \nSetting Targets to Diversify Our Workforce \nFor years, ADI has worked to advance gender equity \nand create an environment where women have the same opportunities for growth and success as their male colleagues. We were excited to be named as one of \u201cThe World\u2019s Top Female-Friendly Companies\u201d by Forbes magazine in 2021 and are renewing our commitment for continued change. We have aspirational targets that outline the progress we hope to make in increasing female representation. Over the next five years, we look to increase our global female manager population from 23% to 29% and our global female engineering (exempt) population from 17% to 26%. We are also increasing our focus on racial equity in the Unit\ned States and more attention will be placed on \naddressing systemic issues that impact our employees of color. Similar to our aspirational targets for women, we have developed targets for increased representation from Black, Hispanic and Latinx communities. Over the next five years, we look to increase our combined Black, Hispanic and Latinx employee population in the United States from\u00a06% to 9%. \n Ensuring Governance \nand Oversight \nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance \nCommittee oversees the company\u2019s environment, social and governance (ESG) policies, goals and programs.
