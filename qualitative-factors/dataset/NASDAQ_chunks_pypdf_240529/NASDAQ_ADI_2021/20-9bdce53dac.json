{"page_content": "ECONOMY GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL ENGAGING WITH IMPACT APPENDICES \nSustainability as a Business \nSustainability as Innovation \nPurpose-Built Innovation \nfor People and Planet \nADI is uniquely positioned to drive \ninnovation in our key markets, including automotive, industrial, communications, digital healthcare and consumer. \nInvention and innovation are said to be born of \nnecessity. What humanity needs now are technological breakthroughs that address the mounting pressures the earth is under: a growing global population; rising demand for food, energy and materials; and decades of rising carbon emissions. In 2015, all United Nations Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity. An urgent call for action was issued around 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We recognize and embrace our responsibility in seeing meaningful progress towards the SDGs and see a direct tie to what our technology enables. ADI connects the physical and digital worlds to transform signals into actions. Our designs, platforms, tools and services help customers across diverse markets bring these technologies to life in products that improve lives in profound ways. \nThe following pages describe how ADI is innovating for society.
