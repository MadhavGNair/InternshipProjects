All of our directors will stand for election for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders. MAJORITY VOTING FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS \nOur bylaws provide for a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections, so a nominee is elected to the Board if the votes \u201cfor\u201d that director exceed the votes \u201cagainst\u201d (with abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as for or against the election). If a nominee does not receive more \u201cfor\u201d votes than \u201cagainst\u201d votes, the director must offer his or her resignation, which the Board of Directors must determine whether to accept and publicly disclose that determination. \nGOVERNANCE POLICIES AND REPORTS \n\u2022 Company Bylaws \n\u2022 Corporate Governance Guidelines \n\u2022 Code of Business Conduct and Ethics \nAdditional Governance Documents are a\nvailable on the Corporate Governance \nsection of our Investor Relations website found here .3434", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
