The climate crisis is a universal challenge, and we\u2019re eager to leverage our culture of problem-solving and innovation in service of bettering our planet. \nEnvironmental sustainability is core to our business, and as such, we bring a long-term focus to our efforts through a three-pronged framework. We aim to: GREEN REVENUE AND R&D \nThe decarbonization and overall greening of the global economy presents meaningful opportunities.

Sustainable technology is a growing investment area for ADI, and as we execute against our Lead \u2013 Optimize \u2013 Engage sustainability framework, we anticipate our level of green activity as reflected as a percent of overall revenue and R&D will increase. \n~25% ~30% \nRevenue R&DEngage Partners across our value chain to join us in revolutionizing our collective sustainability journey Lead With the semiconductor industry in designing products with clear sustainable use applications \ntimiz Op \nOur operations, setting and executing against ambitious goals related to climate and energy, water and waste ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 60, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
