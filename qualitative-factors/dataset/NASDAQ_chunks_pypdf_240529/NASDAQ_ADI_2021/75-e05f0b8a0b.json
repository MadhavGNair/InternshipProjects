{"page_content": "ECONOMY GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL ENGAGING WITH IMPACT APPENDICES \nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \nWe are committed to cultivating an \ninclusive culture, implementing business practices that counteract systemic inequities and engaging with the communities around us to create a better, more just world. Through structural and cultural change, we aim to ensure that employees of all identities and cultures have an equal opportunity to grow and succeed at ADI. \nOur focus is on systemic change. This means driving progress through tough conversations that challenge our dominant culture and historical practices.\u201d \nTEA HUOT, Director, People & Culture Addressing Inequity \nThrough a Holistic and Global Approach \nWe are transforming the way we operate so inclusion \nand equity become an integrated part of how we do business. This means redesigning our talent practices to address systemic barriers and building a culture that confronts bias. \nAt a high level, our focus is on programs that target \nsocietal and organiza\ntional practices. From a societal \nperspective, we are establishing new partnerships and launching programs that increase access to STEM education for communities that are historically denied access. From an organizational perspective, we are revising our processes to mitigate bias and customizing our training programs to accelerate the development of underrepresented communities. \nWe are also evolving our mission to include global \ndimensions of diver\nsity. This means working with \nregional teams to understand what marginalization looks like in countries outside of the United States. The goal is to engage more of our global locations so we can tailor efforts to address underrepresentation.\n75", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 75, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
