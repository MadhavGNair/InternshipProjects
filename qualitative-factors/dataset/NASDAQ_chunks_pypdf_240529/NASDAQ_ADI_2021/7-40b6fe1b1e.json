Producing the same products decade after decade is a cornerstone of our business and our revenue by product vintage is a key performance metric we monitor. We believe obsolescence should be avoided, provided technology and customer demand exist for a product, and when it can\u2019t be avoided, customers are notified two years in advance. \nAnalog Devices uses six designators to inform our customers where a product is in its life cycle. From emerging innovations to products that have been in production for twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is an important criteria that customers must consider. \nFor our full policy including the six designators visit \nAnalog Devices Product Lifecycle Information. \n(1) Figure represents combined revenue for ADI and Maxim \nIntegrated Products, Inc., with Maxim\u2019s revenue from November 1, 2020 until August 26, 2021 (the date of acquisition) mapped to ADI\u2019s fiscal 2021 revenue.
