Sponsored by our Young Professionals Network (YPN), a virtual immersive program allows students to experience a day in the life of an engineer. Additionally, through the Philippines\u2019 Academe Linkage program, ADI provided demos, workshops, mentorship and a coder\u2019s guild where a virtual hackathon was hosted with over 22 schools and 66 teams participating. \nIn India, ADI held its annual technical competition, \nAn\nveshan, that provides an opportunity for engineering \nstudents to innovate and design products that can uplift the standard of living of our society. Selected project teams are funded and given access to hardware and tools, as well as ADI mentoring for over six months. Each year there is a theme for the competition. In previous years, the Anveshan themes were focused on applications. This past year, the theme pivoted to \u201csilicon design to verification\u201d to help address a technical gap in engineering talent in the region. In addition to Anveshan, ADI also supported the setup of laboratories in the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay and Tirupati by donating ADALM1000s and SHARC DSP boards.\n96\n96", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2021.pdf", "page": 96, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
