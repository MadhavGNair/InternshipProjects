{"page_content": "42 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2021 IMPACT REPORT ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nFrom  \nCarbon Neutral \nto Net-Zero\nUpwork has been committed to \noperating as a carbon-neutral \ncompany since 2020 and has \nachieved carbon neutrality since \n2019. In 2021, we embraced a net-\nzero goal and focused our efforts \non reducing our own emissions \nand offsetting when there is no \nfeasible alternative.  \nOur remote-first model enabled \nus to reduce our office-based \nemissions over the past two years. \nWe recognize, however, that our \nteam members who work from \nhome or an alternative workspace \non behalf of Upwork consume \nenergy. We are looking into ways \nto quantify that energy use in \nthe future. We\u2019re also working to decrease our Scope 3 emissions. \nIn 2021, Upwork made significant \nprogress in transitioning our cloud \ncomputing and storage services \nto a carbon-neutral facility, and we \nexpect to be fully transitioned by the \nend of 2022. We also continued to \nsubsidize public transportation used \nfor employee commuting.\nUpwork purchases renewable \nenergy credits (RECs) and carbon \ncredits to offset the emissions \nwe cannot avoid. We do so with \nmaximum environmental benefit \nin mind, electing to fund forestry \nprojects that support biodiversity \nand indigenous communities, and \npurchase RECs that fund new clean \nenergy generation.\nREDD in the Yaeda Valley\n\u2022 We purchase offsets to reduce \nthe impact of our Scope 3 \nemissions, protect critical \nforests and wildlife, and improve \nthe livelihoods of Hadza and \npastoralist communities in \nnorthern Tanzania. \nNew Renewables Portfolio   \n\u2022 To offset Upwork\u2019s Scope 2 \nemissions, we invest in Native \nEnergy\u2019s new renewable  \nenergy projects in North \nAmerica. All projects are \nGreen-e certified.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_UPWK_2021.pdf", "page": 41, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
