Temperature gains above 2 \u00b0C (relative to the pre-industrial period) would have catastrophic  \neconomic and social consequences. \nThe growing demand for decision-useful, climate-related information from organizations across all sectors of the economy has given rise to several disclosure standards that support greater \naccountability and transparency. One such standard, established in  2015, is the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which defines a set of voluntary disclosures of climate-\nrelated financial risk. Using the TCFD format, companies can inform stakeholders of any risks relating to climate change that they face.\nThe TCFD structures their recommendations around four themes that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n2022 TCFD Index\n Governance\nDisclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.\na.
