{"page_content": "E\u2013SCRAP RECLAIM\nSemiconductor manufacturing includes dealing with leftover scrap material, such as failed \nproducts and test devices, as well as used metal, engineering materials, and silicon. \nSome scrap material contains precious metals (gold, palladium, platinum, silver) and non-\nprecious metals (copper, nickel, tin). Our E-Scrap Program ships scrap waste to processing \nplants that reclaim and recover these valuable (and potentially toxic) metals to reduce the \namount of e-waste sent to landfills.\nIn 2022, although production increased 9% compared to 2021, our e-scrap went down,  \nmainly due to process-yield improvements implemented during the year. Since 2015, we \nhave implemented various programs to improve the identification and collection of e-scrap, \nbut the overall approach is to decrease the amount of e-scrap by increasing efficiencies in \nprocess yield.
