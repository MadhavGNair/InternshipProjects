{"page_content": "WASTE\nWASTE RESULTS\nOur total waste generation includes regular ongoing waste generated by our manufacturing \nsites (including manufacturing, office, and cafeteria waste), as well as one-time waste. We \nconsider one-time waste to be those waste streams that are not generated as part of normal \noperations, but rather by unique, one-time projects. One-time waste accounted for less than \n1% of total waste generation in 2022, and is not included in our normal waste metrics and \nanalysis unless otherwise indicated.\nIn 2022, our production increased and, as a result, we generated more waste. However, our \nefforts to reduce, reuse, and recycle the waste produced by our manufacturing processes \nimproved our overall waste performance. Compared to 2021, our hazardous waste decreased \nby 11%, our total amount of waste sent to landfill decreased by 9%, and our total amount of \nnon-hazardous waste sent to landfill decreased by 19%. We continue to review opportunities \nfor further improvement.\n05,000,00010,000,00015,000,00020,000,00025,000,000\nOne-Time Manufacturing2012 2013 2015 2014 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Kilogram (kg)Manufacturing and One-Time Waste\n02,000,0004,000,0006,000,000\nNon-Hazardous Hazardous2012 2013 2015 2014 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Kilogram (kg)Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste\n 18%\nIncrease  \nfrom 202123%\nIncrease  \nfrom 20122022 TOTAL WASTE PERFORMANCE\nThe Bangkok, Thailand manufacturing site found a composting factory that recycles \nvegetable waste and grease-trap waste.NXP in Action\n151 \n2022 ESG HIGHLIGHTS\nOUR BUSINESS\nECONOMYINTRODUCTION\nGOVERNANCE \nESG\nENVIRONMENT\nSUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT\nPRODUCT STEWARDSHIP\nAPPENDICESOUR TEAM MEMBERS\nOverview\nManagement\nEmissions\nEnergy\nWater\nWaste\nPackaging\nHazardous Chemicals and Materials", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_NXPI_2022.pdf", "page": 150, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
