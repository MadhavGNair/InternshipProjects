{"page_content": "The packaging we use for shipping consists mainly of paper, cardboard, and plastic. We also \nuse a small amount of wood, in the form of wooden pallets, to ship our products. The 2022 \npackaging data represents approximately half our sites. We will continue to improve data \ncollection related to packaging for all our sites.\nIn 2022, our manufacturing production increased 9% from 2021 and, subsequently, our \npackaging increased slightly as well. Packaging isn\u2019t always directly proportional to our \nproduction, due to packaging efficiencies and product dimensions.\nWe use special packaging materials to protect our products from damage during shipment.  \nWe are committed to using specially designed packaging tubes and shipping trays that save \non space and weight and are also easy to reuse and recycle.\nWe advise our customers on the possibilities for recycling our packaging. We know that \nmost of our larger customers already have recycling programs in place, but we don\u2019t receive \naccurate figures on how much of our packaging is actually recycled.PACKAGING\n01,0002,0003,0004,0005,000\n2012 2013 2015 2014 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022TonsPackaging\nTotal Packaging Use\n05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,0003,500\nWood Plastics Paper and Cardboard2012 2014 2016 2018 2013 2015 2017 2020 2019 2021 2022TonsPackaging Types\n155 \n2022 ESG HIGHLIGHTS\nOUR BUSINESS\nECONOMYINTRODUCTION\nGOVERNANCE \nESG\nENVIRONMENT\nSUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT\nPRODUCT STEWARDSHIP\nAPPENDICESOUR TEAM MEMBERS\nOverview\nManagement\nEmissions\nEnergy\nWater\nWaste\nPackaging\nHazardous Chemicals and Materials", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_NXPI_2022.pdf", "page": 154, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
