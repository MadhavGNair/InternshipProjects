Over time, the savings \nfrom this increased efficiency mean that \nthe individuals who are the ultimate \ninvestors\u2014mutual fund investors, pension \nplan participants, ETF investors and \ninsurance policy holders\u2014retain more of \ntheir investment returns. Structurally, this \ntechnology-driven openness strengthens \nthe resilience of fixed-income markets on \nwhich companies rely to finance business \ninvestments, and that governments \nand communities tap to fund spending, \neducation and infrastructure priorities. \nMarket resilience and confidence is \nespecially important in periods of higher \nvolatility when MarketAxess has proven \nto be an essential marketplace for fixed \nincome participants.As we move forward with our ESG \ninitiatives, we are making the most of the \nopportunities MarketAxess has by virtue \nof its global business to promote solutions \nthat advance equality, build communities, \nand strengthen access and fairness in the \nworld\u2019s capital markets.  \nLast year, we brought a bold innovation \nspecifically designed to promote fairness \nand equal access to fixed-income markets \n\u2014the Diversity Dealer Initiative (DDI).  \nWe know that our clients want efficient \naccess to the services and trading liquidity \nof minority-, women-, and veteran-owned \nbroker-dealers as part of their own \ncommitment to ESG principles.
