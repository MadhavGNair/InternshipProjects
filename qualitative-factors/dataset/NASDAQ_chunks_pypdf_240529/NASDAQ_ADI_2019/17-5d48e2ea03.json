ADI monitors Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and consolidates  \nGHG emissions from which it has operational control: wafer fabrication facilities, and assembly and test facilities.  \nEmissions from sources owned or controlled by ADI,  \nincluding fossil fuels used on site.\nIndirect emissions from electricity, heating and cooling  \ngenerated offsite but purchased by ADI.\nPurchased goods and services; fuel and energy related activities \nnot included in Scope 1 or 2; waste generated in operations; \nbusiness travel; employee commuting; downstream transportation \nand distribution and end-of-life treatment of sold products.SCOPE \n1\nSCOPE \n2\nSCOPE \n3GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION\nGHG Emissions, Tons  \nImprovements in our abatement system as well as shifting \nto renewable energy sources have driven the decrease in our \nScope 1 + 2 by 37% from 2015 GHG Emissions, Tons\nShift to\nRenewable\nEnergy\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019219,057 217,769\n146,567 145,036GHG Emissions,\nTons,\n137,321\nSource and Associations\nSCOPE 1: Stationary combustion and process emissions: \nPerflourocarbons (PFCs), SF6, NF3  \n(from wafer fabrication processes)  \nSCOPE 2: Purchased electricity  \nSCOPE 3: Business travelSince 2013, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and our Scope 3 \nemissions from business travel have been verified by a  \nthird party. We also report our emissions to the CDP, formerly  \nCarbon Disclosure Project.Emissions are measured and estimated using the Greenhouse \nGas Protocol and GWP from the IPCC Fifth Assessment report. \nEmission factors used from US-EPA Climate Leadership \nEmissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories and \nmarket-based factors where available; otherwise, location-\nbased emission factors were used.We exceeded the previous 2.5% intensity based Scope 1  \nreduction goal and we are moving to a more ambitious  \nabsolute reduction goal of 50% Scope 1 + 2 emissions by  \n2025 from our 2015 baseline.PROTECTING AND REGENERATING  \nTHE ENVIRONMENT\n2019 ANALOG DEVICES CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\n18", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2019.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
