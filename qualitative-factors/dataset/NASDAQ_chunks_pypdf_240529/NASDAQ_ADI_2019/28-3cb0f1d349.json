Since 2013, we have \ncertified three new buildings to the \nLEED (Leadership in Energy and \nEnvironmental Design) Standard, and \nwe continue to design, construct, \noperate and maintain our buildings \nin accordance with LEED and other \ngreen standards in sustainable site \ndevelopment, water efficiency, energy \nefficiency, materials selection and \nindoor environmental quality.ADI Philippines Campus LEED Features  \nCavite, Philippines Office\nLEED-Gold certified\n\u2022 Reflective roof surfaces and exterior insulation \nconserve energy for cooling\n\u2022 Stormwater management system prevents runoff \nand reduces environmental impact\n\u2022 Efficient cooling system with underfloor air \ndistribution technology\n\u2022 100% LED fixtures for internal lighting\n\u2022 Rainwater harvesting and water recycling for \nlandscaping and restroomsADI Ireland Campus LEED Features  \nEuropean Research and Development Center in  \nLimerick, Ireland campus  \nLEED-Platinum certified\n\u2022 Central glass atrium reduces lighting needs  \nand increases employees\u2019 connection with  \nthe environment\n\u2022 Smart and high-efficiency lighting saves  \n100,000 kWh annually over typical systems\n\u2022 Solar panels generate ~9,400 kWh annually\n\u2022 Reflective roofing and efficient air conditioning \nfurther reduce greenhouse gas emissions\nOFFICE EFFICIENCY \nRunning on Renewables  \nWe now power core computing needs in our datacenters with enough  \nrenewable energy to offset the power-related emissions of 50 U.S. homes. 50\nU.S. Homes worth  \nof power-related  \nemissions offsetPROTECTING AND REGENERATING  \nTHE ENVIRONMENT\n2019 ANALOG DEVICES CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\n29", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2019.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
