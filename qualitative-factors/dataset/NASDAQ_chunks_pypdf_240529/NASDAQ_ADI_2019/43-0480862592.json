ADI's industrial hygiene surveillance program minimizes \nand prevents exposures in the workplace and reduces \nthe risk of specific diseases. We use two industry \nstandard metrics to assess injury performance and \ntrends worldwide.\nAll legacy ADI sites have ISO 45001 health and safety \ncertification, while sites from our acquisition of  Linear Technology are working towards certification  \nto the same standard.\nADI incident rates and lost workday rates are better \nthan U.S. semiconductor and manufacturing industries.WORKER SAFETY\nINCIDENT RATE PER 100 WORKERS\nLOST WORKDAY RATE  PER 100 WORKERS 0.001.002.003.004.005.00\n0.380.903.40\nAnalog Devices (Global)U.S Semiconductor IndustryU.S Manufacturing Industry\n0.000.400.801.20\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2019 2018 2017 20160.2\n0.13 Analog Devices (Global)0.9 U.S Manufacturing Industry\nU.S Semiconductor Industry\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2019 2018 2017 2016INCIDENT RATE PER 100 WORKERS\nLOST WORKDAY RATE  PER 100 WORKERS 0.001.002.003.004.005.00\n0.380.903.40\nAnalog Devices (Global)U.S Semiconductor IndustryU.S Manufacturing Industry\n0.000.400.801.20\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2019 2018 2017 20160.2\n0.13 Analog Devices (Global)0.9 U.S Manufacturing Industry\nU.S Semiconductor Industry\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2019 2018 2017 2016EMPOWERING PEOPLE\nWorkplace Injury/Fatality Incident Rate\nIncident rate:  Number of reportable incidents per 100 employees working a full year.
