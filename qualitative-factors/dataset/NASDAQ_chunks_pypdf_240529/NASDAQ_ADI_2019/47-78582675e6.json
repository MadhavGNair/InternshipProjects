Together they were able to identify housing  \nfor nearly 400 employees, across local hotels and within plant facilities. \nIn addition, the team provided significant relief efforts to local communities, \nincluding the donation of protective equipment to hospitals, the donation of \ngroceries to the most vulnerable and at-risk people and holding a donation \ndrive that raised more than $12,000 towards the acquisition of PPE for local \nhealthcare workers and first responders.\nThis is just one example where our employees, management and leaders joined \nin their commitment to overcome obstacles so they could continue to supply  \nthe technologies and equipment to customers in need and contribute to the \nglobal COVID-19 response efforts.RESPONDING TO COVID-19OUR IMPACT\n48 2019 ANALOG DEVICES CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2019.pdf", "page": 47, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
