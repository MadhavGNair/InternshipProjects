Our ability to do so\u2014and \nour commitment to solving the world\u2019s toughest problems while we \nengineer a better future\u2014has become even more evident during the \nunprecedented challenges faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \nFor example, ADI stepped in to help meet the needs of the medical \ncommunity by shifting towards technologies that support the global \nresponse to the crisis. This included increasing the production of \ncomponents for critical point-of-care solutions, such as ventilators, \ninfusion pumps and diagnostic imaging systems.\n \nAnd our impact extends beyond our own capabilities and facilities. \nThe Analog Devices Foundation made donations of $4 million to the \nWorld Health Organization\u2019s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund and \nwas a key supporter of the Global Citizen \u201cOne World: Together At \nHome\u201d campaign. Additionally, the foundation donated $500,000 to \nMassachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, \nwhich will further advance the importance of testing and vaccine \nresearch at the center.Combined, these efforts underscore our shared purpose and \ncommitment to our role as corporate citizens and are a testament  \nto what we can achieve when we align around solving complex  \nproblems together.\n \nAs we look beyond the immediate challenges  \nof our current environment, we believe  \nthere is much more we can do to leverage  \nour expertise to make a positive impact  \non the world around us. \nVINCENT ROCHE\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE  \nOFFICER\n3 2019 ANALOG DEVICES CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2019.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
