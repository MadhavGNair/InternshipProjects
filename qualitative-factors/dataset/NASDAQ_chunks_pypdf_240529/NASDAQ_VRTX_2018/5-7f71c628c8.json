Yet it\u2019s  important to us and our stakeholders to minimize our environmental impacts  throughout our operations. \nAt our principal locations in Boston, San Diego and London, we\u2019ve seen measurable \nprogress in energy and carbon emissions reduction, waste minimization, water usage  and green chemistry practices. We\u2019re building on these efforts in 2019 and establishing global, long-term environmental goals. \nEnergy and Carbon Reduction\nIn 2016 we joined other Boston institutions in the Mayor\u2019s Carbon Cup, part of the city\u2019s Climate Action Plan to achieve a 35 percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2020. Today, we\u2019re on track to reduce GHG emissions at our Boston headquarters by  35 percent by 2020 against a 2015 baseline. This progress reflects a significant decrease  \nin energy use in that time period, achieved by projects that include optimizing air flow throughout our Boston laboratories and offices and upgrading to more energy-efficient lighting. We have implemented similar engineering efficiencies at our research facility in Oxford, UK, and our new research facility in San Diego. In addition, our Oxford research facility currently sources 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources.   \nOn Target to Reduce  \nGHG emissions at  \nour Boston Headquarters  \nby 35 percent35%We are committed to limiting our \nenvironmental impacts and to operating in a sustainable manner. \n61270_VRTZ.indd   4 5/30/19   11:19 AM", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VRTX_2018.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
