Each day, we look for ways to make an impact. \nTwo of USANA\u2019s core values are Community and Health. We focus our community engagement efforts through the USANA Foundation, helping underserved communities \naround the world gain access to nutritious and sustainable sources of food as a way to represent those values.\nThrough 60 USANA-supported partners, we strive to nourish, equip, and eliminate hunger \nthroughout the world. \nUSANA Foundation Giving Numbers \n2022 2021 2020\nTotal global aid $1.2M $1M $2.3M\nMeals distributed 12.9M 4.5M 5.2M\nGarden Towers funded 32K 46 34 We believe no \nchild should \never go hungry. \nHunger is more than missing a meal. It\u2019s a \ndebilitating crisis affecting every corner of \nthe globe\u2014a crisis exacerbated by COVID-19. \nUSANA  is a unique USANA \nFoundation initiative that works to provide \nsecure and safe food sources to at-risk \nchildren, raise public awareness surrounding \nfood insecurity, and generate resources \nand revenue through local campaigns and \nvolunteer opportunities. \nIn 2022, USANA  provided \nbackpacks filled with food for food insecure \nyouth to 44 schools, community programs, \nand neighborhood clubs throughout Utah. \nEach bag had enough food for seven meals, \nand in some cases, food to sustain kids \non weekends and extended breaks. At the \nheart of USANA Kids Eat is a network of \nvolunteers who donate money, time, and \nenergy throughout the year to help pack \nfood-filled backpacks.\nUSANA  supported 44 additional \nschools by providing large packs of food \nfor children to take home during long \nholiday breaks.The USANA Foundation calculates the \nannual meals provided using two main \nmethods: partner chairty check-ins and \nGarden Tower production. \nWhen accounting for Matching Grant \nefforts, they verify the food items and \nquantities listed by each partner charity \nin their grant proposal. The Foundation \nobtains receipts as proof of purchase, \nrequires regular updates, and tracks the \nproject's progress through visual evidence \nlike photos and video. \nThe second calculation method is based \non experience and data gathered over the \npast three years of Garden Tower projects. \nOne Garden Tower is estimated to provide \nat least 1,300 meals in a year. Calculating \nmeals from a tower is usually equivalent \nto 2\u20133 servings per vegetable to ensure it \naccounts for adequate nutrition. Feedback \non these numbers is gathered directly \nfrom families who build and harvest towers \nand through the Foundation's partners. \nAlthough Garden Towers are designed \nto last many years, the Foundation only \ncounts the meals provided by one tower \nfor one year, ensuring that its calculations \nremain conservative.\nFor more information, read the \nUSANA Foundation's 2022 Annual Report.Every person should have access to secure sources of quality, \nnutritious food.\nProvides immediate and long-term global food relief for \nthose in severe need. We lead a network of community-driven \npartnerships to nourish, equip, and eliminate hunger and \nmalnutrition throughout the\u00a0world.
