We completed safety assessments for\n1,500 processes, issued 13,000 pages of policies and trained 105,000 employees and contractors.\nThroughout 2015 we\u2019ll reach several more important merger milestones. First on the list are our combined frequent\n\ufb02ier programs. Later in 2015, we\u2019ll move to a single reservations system. This is a huge undertaking, and it has\nprompted additional hiring and intensive employee training.\nIntegration milestones, 2015 and beyond\nPost-integration goals and initiatives will take us into 2016; continuing our re\ufb01ned legacy of the best airline in the\nworld.\nInvesting in infrastructure growth\nAs we continue to enlarge our footprint and enhance existing facilities, we are investing in infrastructure across our\nglobal network, investments which are in turn catalysts for other infrastructure projects.\nHere are some highlights of recent facility upgrades that are generating construction jobs and broadening our\neconomic impact:\nExpansion of Terminal F at Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). The state-of-the-art baggage claim area will\nmake picking up bags easier while expanded checkpoint facilities in the ticketing building will double passenger\nscreening capacity, shortening passenger wait times.\nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) continues its multiyear renovation project that will make it easier\nto park, check through security and locate checked bags. In 2014, at Terminal A, the focus of many of our\n\ufb02ights, several gates and a new light-rail station that connects travelers to downtown Dallas were completed.\nTo accommodate our growing schedule, we have added gates at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and\nwill be completely renovating the Admirals Club there.\nWashington D.C.\u2019s Reagan National Airport (DCA) will begin improvements that will facilitate connections\nbetween American\u2019s concourses and an all-new terminal for regional \ufb02ights.\nWe began construction in 2014 on the 200,000 square-foot Robert W. Baker Integrated Operations Center\n(IOC) near DFW Airport. When completed, it will house more than 1,400 employees who plan and dispatch\nAmerican\u2019s 1 million annual mainline \ufb02ights.\nManaging risk\nStrong corporate governance structures allows independence\nWe\u2019re committed to strong corporate governance.
