{"page_content": "American Airlines Corporate Responsibility | Safety and\nReliability\nCreating a safe workplace\nEmployees are a top priority\nWe track safety analytics, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) audit data, and investigations\ninto injuries, near misses, ground damages and other incidents. By centralizing this information, we can better\nanticipate and eliminate safety risks and maintain full compliance.\nWhile we continue to develop better information technology solutions to identify problematic practices and reduce\nrisk, the key to safety will always be building and reinforcing a culture of compliance. A culture of compliance is at\nthe core of the American way, and maintaining that culture means that employees are mindful of safety at all times\nand assiduously follow all safety policies and procedures.\nCommitment to collaboration\nWe work with regulators and outside partners to enhance our workplace safety practices. Lessons from regulators,\nlabor unions or competitors can be priceless in preventing harm. Key sources of input include:\nEmployee insights - Our employees are on the front line of critical safety issues, so we take their concerns very\nseriously.\nUnion coordination - Unions, whose representatives join American\u2019s meetings with OSHA, play an invaluable\nrole in advancing safety practices.\nOSHA collaboration - American managers meet with regional OSHA administrators from around the country,\ndescribing in detail the company\u2019s safety processes. Resulting improvements in communication can lead to\nfewer subsequent OSHA complaints.\nA strong safety record - Employee injury rates have declined to their lowest point in the past \ufb01ve years and\naircraft ground damages are down almost 30 percent.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2014.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
