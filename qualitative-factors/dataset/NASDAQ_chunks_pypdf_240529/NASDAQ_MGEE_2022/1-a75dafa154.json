{"page_content": "Sustainability Snapshot 2\nThird-party analysis of our net-zero carbon goal\nIn 2020, the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies published its analysis of MGE\u2019s goal of net-zero carbon electricity by 2050. The study was done within the context of the October 2018 special report by the IPCC on global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius. \nThe models suggested that, by 2050, emissions from electricity generation in industrialized countries should be 87% to 99% lower than the 2005 baseline. MGE\u2019s plan for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is a 100% reduction from \n2005 levels and reflects carbon reductions \nconsistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The UW-Madison report is available at  \nmge.com/netzeroreport.\nRead more about our partnership with climate experts at the UW-Madison\u2019s Nelson Institute.MGE\u2019s plan for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is a \n100% reduction from 2005 levels and reflects carbon reductions consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.2005 2020 2030 2050\u2022 80%  reduction in carbon\nby 2030\n\u2022NET-ZERO  carbon by 2050baseline\n-20%\n-40%\n-60%\n-80%\n-100%*Actual results may differ\nfrom projections.achievedNet-zero carbon electricity\nMGE was one of the first utilities in the nation to commit to carbon reduction goals consistent with climate science. \nOur goals reflect our vision and signal our direction but do not determine our pace.
