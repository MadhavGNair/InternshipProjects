The electric grid is a shared resource for the benefit of everyone, providing for the safety and security of a community through safe, reliable electricity.\nWe\u2019re investing in the systems and capabilities to enable an electric grid that supports new technology such as \ndistributed energy sources like solar and battery storage. We have an important role to play to ensure that new resources and technologies are harnessed for the benefit of all customers.\nThis increasingly more advanced electric grid requires a conductor to ensure the system develops and operates \nin a way that keeps electricity safe, reliable and affordable for everyone. As the public utility, MGE serves as this conductor for our community grid.\nWhen the utility serves as the conductor of the electric grid, new technologies and resources can add value to \nthe system because the utility is able to dispatch generation and balance demand as needed. With more sources of two-way power flows\u2014power flowing to the customer from the grid and power flowing from the customer\u2019s generation back onto the grid\u2014a single conductor system provides efficiency in coordinating the different sources of power and the various needs of the grid in real time to maintain a safe and reliable power supply.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2022.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
