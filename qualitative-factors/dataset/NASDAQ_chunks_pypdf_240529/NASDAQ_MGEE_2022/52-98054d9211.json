The guidelines are generally aimed at determining whether a director has a relationship which, in the opinion of the MGE Energy board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out director responsibilities. The guidelines identify certain relationships that are considered to affect independence, such as a current or past employment relationship with the company, the receipt by the director or one of his or her family members of compensation in excess of $120,000 from the company for other than board or board committee service and commercial relationships exceeding specified dollar thresholds. These guidelines also are reflected in MGE Energy\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines.  \nThe board has determined that seven of the nine directors are independent under the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., \ndefinition of independence and the company\u2019s Directors Independence Standards, which parallel the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., definition. All members of the Corporate Governance Committee, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee are considered independent.
