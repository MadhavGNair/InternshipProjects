This report is reviewed by the board annually. Report data also is audited by the company\u2019s Internal Audit team. \nEEI ESG/sustainability reporting template \nTo advance further transparency and disclosure, MGE also participates in the Edison Electric Institute\u2019s (EEI) \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) sustainability-related reporting template. The voluntary, industry-\nspecific template includes both qualitative and quantitative information. The quantitative template includes data \nrelated to MGE\u2019s energy portfolio (generation and capacity), emissions, capital expenditures, and human and natural \nresources.
