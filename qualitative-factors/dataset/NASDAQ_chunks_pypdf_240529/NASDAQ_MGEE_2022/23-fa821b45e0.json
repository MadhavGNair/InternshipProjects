The utility as conductor can optimize the efficiency and use of the electric system\u2019s assets to help control costs and optimize benefits and value over time, which leads to lower costs for  all customers. The benefits of grid resiliency, reliability and a more efficiently managed power system are captured for all customers, individually and collectively.\nToday\u2019s customer expects a grid that integrates all sorts of energy technologies in a way that gives them  \nchoice, flexibility and value. New technology is changing how we plan for the energy grid of the future;  however, our obligation to serve customers and communities 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days  a year remains unchanged.\nConnected Communities\nIn fall 2021, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) announced projects selected to receive grants to  integrate buildings with distributed energy resources, such as solar photovoltaic generation and EV charging. A $5 million grant with a $3 million cost share was awarded to Slipstream Group for a project with the City of Madison, MGE and others.\nAccording to the DOE, the plans call for the conversion of about 15 facilities to grid-interactive, efficient buildings \nand added EV charging nearby. If this project shows improvements in cost-effective efficiency and demand flexibility, it will serve as a model for communities across the country. Connected Communities funding supports projects that expand the DOE\u2019s network of grid-interactive, efficient building communities nationwide to help achieve a decarbonized electricity system by 2035 and decarbonized energy sector by 2050. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2022.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
