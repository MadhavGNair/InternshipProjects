Sanderson Jr., and current President and Chief Operating Officer, \nLampkin Butts, serve as mentors throughout her lengthy career. \u201cMy \nmother always said she never felt like just an employee, she felt like family,\u201d \nsaid Wells. \u201cNow, I am happy that I have joined this same family.\u201d\nOne of the many reasons Wells was intent upon joining the same family her \nparents were so proud to be a part of was because of the company\u2019s giving \nnature. \u201cFollowing the recent tornadoes in Mississippi, Sanderson Farms \nprovided free chicken and ice to the families affected by the storms,\u201d said \nWells. \u201cYou will not find these acts of goodness in the paper and you will not \nsee them on the news, but Sanderson Farms is contributing in some way, \nsomewhere, on a daily basis.\u201d \nSince joining the company, Wells has been intentional about her own \ninvolvement in the company\u2019s charitable efforts, serving as an active \nvolunteer at the 2019 Sanderson Farms Championship. As the only PGA \nTOUR sporting event in the state of Mississippi, the event has had a \ncharitable impact of over $9.7 million since the company became title \nsponsor in 2013. \n\u201cI initially became interested in volunteering at the championship because \nof the organization receiving the donation, Blair E. Batson Children\u2019s \nHospital,\u201d said Wells. \u201cMy husband and I have a young daughter, and I \ncould not imagine her being unhealthy. To think what parents of children \nwho are sick are going through breaks my heart. I wanted to volunteer so \nthat I could make a difference, be it small, in the lives of those families.\u201d\n77", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SAFM_2019.pdf", "page": 38, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
