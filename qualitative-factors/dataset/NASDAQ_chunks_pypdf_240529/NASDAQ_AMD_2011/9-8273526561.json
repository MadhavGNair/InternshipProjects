These groups monitor our corporate responsibility efforts, and  we engage with them in various ways  to evaluate how we are doing, and  how we can improve.\nStakeholder  \nEngagement Panel\nIn 2011, we established a stakeholder panel with the help of Ceres, an award-winning non-profit organization focused on business and sustainability. We will continue to work with the panel over the long term to gain a deep understanding of our stakeholders\u2019 expectations, which helps us build a world-class corporate responsibility program. The panel has already met twice and provided us with valuable insights and perspectives on how to improve our corporate responsibility strategies, communications and performance.\nEmployee Satisfaction \nIn 2011, we surveyed our employees worldwide to understand their overall satisfaction and their impressions of our corporate responsibility programs.
