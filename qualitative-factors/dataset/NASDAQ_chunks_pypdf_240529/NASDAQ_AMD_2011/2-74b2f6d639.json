That\u2019s where AMD Changing the Game comes in: our signature education initiative designed to inspire kids to learn by teaching them to create video games. Here are some telling statistics. Two-\nthirds of American high school students \nreport being bored in class every day.\n1 \nYet those same students who are tuning \nout in school are tuning in to video games, with an estimated 97% of U.S. teens playing online games.\n2\nAMD Changing the Game uses this passion as leverage for learning. But instead of playing video games, our program teaches kids how to create them. Through game creation, students learn science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills, as well as problem solving, critical thinking, language skills and teamwork. By using age- and skill-appropriate tools, the program works with key education partners to guide students through the creative process, and teaches \nthe mechanics of game design and \nproduction. And these are not the violent \ngames that can worry parents; the curriculum focuses on developing games around important social issues \u2013 such as energy conservation, healthcare, and reducing poverty.\n04       2011 AMD Corporate Responsibility Summary 2011 AMD Corporate Responsibility Summary        051 Yazzie-Mintz, E.
