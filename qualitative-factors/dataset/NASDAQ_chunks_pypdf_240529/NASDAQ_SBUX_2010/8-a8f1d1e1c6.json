{"page_content": "9Starbucks Global Responsibility Report\nGoals & Progress 2010\nOver the years, our white cup has \nbecome an iconic and integral part \nof the coffeehouse experience. \nAt the same time, it has become \na concern among some of our \ncustomers due to recycling \nchallenges. We have learned that \napplying innovative, responsible \nbusiness strategies to address the \nunintended consequences of our \nbusiness can yield groundbreaking \nresponsible business results. One \nexample of this is our effort to lead \nour industry by working toward \nour goal of making 100 percent of \nour cups reusable or recyclable1 \nby 2015. We\u2019re currently working \non a number of complementary \ninitiatives to advance our \nprogress in this area. We know \nthis is a complex issue, and we\u2019re \ncommitted to collaborating with \na wide range of stakeholders to \ndrive meaningful change. \nRecycling\nWhile some communities already recycle our \npaper and plastic cups, most don\u2019t have the \ninfrastructure in place to handle collection, \nhauling and processing due to a lack of \ndemand for cup material by the recycling \nindustry. This inconsistency makes it difficult \nfor us \u2013 with more than 17,000 retail locations \nglobally \u2013 to efficiently and effectively \nimplement recycling strategies. \nTo achieve greater scalability and \nstandardization, in 2008 we set a goal to \ndevelop comprehensive recycling solutions \nfor our paper and plastic cups by 2012. We\u2019re \ncurrently on track to meet this goal. Ultimately, we want our cups \u2013 which in the \nUnited States account for about 95 percent \nof our in-store beverage packaging \u2013 to be \nrecyclable in form and in practice.  \nWe won\u2019t consider our cups universally \nrecyclable until our customers can recycle them \nin our stores, at their homes and workplaces, \nand in public spaces.\nWhen we initially delved into this issue, we \nbelieved making our cups from alternative \nmaterials was the key to broader acceptance \ninto the recycling stream. Through subsequent \ndiscussions with stakeholders from across our \ncup value chain, we learned that the cup can \nbe recyclable as constructed. The real obstacle \nis the lack of robust commercial and residential \nrecycling systems in many of the communities \nwhere we do business. \nWe have taken a systems-based approach to \ngain a better understanding of the recycling \nlandscape and identify specific actions \nwe can take to reduce waste. We hosted groundbreaking cup summits  in Seattle in \nMay 2009  and Boston in April 2010 , where \nwe met with government officials, raw material \nsuppliers, cup manufacturers, retail and \nbeverage businesses, recyclers, competitors, \nconservation groups and academic experts.\nPilot programs have become an important \ncomponent of our strategy, demonstrating what \nis possible, and in turn enabling us to scale \nthose solutions. For example, in early 2010 we \nworked with Global Green USA\u2019s Coalition for \nResource Recovery  to test the recyclability of \nour paper cups with old corrugated cardboard \n\u2013 the most extensively recycled material in the \nUnited States. This pilot, which initially took \nplace in seven Starbucks stores in Manhattan, \nwas expanded later in the year to include 86 of \nour New York stores. Through this exercise, we \ngained a better understanding of local recycling \nprocesses and the most effective methods for \ncup collection inside our stores. In 2011 we \nplan to launch additional recycling programs in \na number of our store communities.\nGOALS PROGRESS\nInfrastructureCollectionDesign\nNEEDS IMPROVEMENT\nNEEDS IMPROVEMENTU.S. and Canada company-owned storesLocations\nLocations with \nfront-of-store recycling100%\n5%\n* U.S. and Canada company-owned stores\n** U.S., Canada, and U.K. company-owned stores\n*** Global company-owned stores21.9 Million Times*26.3 Million Times**\n32.6 Million Times***\n1.3%\n20081.5%\n20091.8%\n201025%\n2015ON TRACKON TRACKChiapas, Mexico\nSumatra, Indonesia\nBaseline year: 2008\nGOALS PROGRESS\nON TRACKImproved \nindoor \nenvironmental \nquality\nWater \nef/f_iciencyCO2 \nemissions \nreductionStewardship of \nresources and\nsensitivity to \ntheir impactsEnergy \nsavingsGOALS PROGRESS\n(lb)\n(lb)(kg)\n(kg)385\n174\n295\n134\n2008367\n166\n299\n136\n2009269\n122\n226\n103\n2010 2015Total coffee purchases\n(Millions)\nTotal C.A.F .E.
