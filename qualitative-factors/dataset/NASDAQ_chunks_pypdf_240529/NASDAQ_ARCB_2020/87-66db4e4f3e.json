He \nalso held five different military occupational \nspecialties, including combat arms, military \nintelligence, military police officer, air defense \ncrewmember and recruiting. \nIn his new role, Jerry builds relationships with \nunit commanders and teams from different \ninstallations, across all branches of the \nmilitary. The best thing about this job is giving \nback to the service members. They serve \ntheir country anywhere from three to 20 \nyears, and I feel like we as a company can \nshow our appreciation for their service by \noffering them a possible career path or \nsecond career.\n1st Sgt.
