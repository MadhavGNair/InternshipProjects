This was especially true \nthroughout 2020 when overcoming supply chain obstacles \nwas crucial to transporting essential goods and medical \nsupplies to keeping pharmacies and grocery stores stocked.  \nThrough our Voice of the Customer (VOC) program, we \nregularly survey customers and calculate Net Promoter  \nScores (NPS), which helps us identify how customers \nfeel about our service and company. Based on customer \nfeedback, we completed 340 projects to improve systems, \nprocesses or training in 2020. Updated ABF Claims Initiative \nTo continue a strong emphasis on quality and further improve \nour customers experience (CX), we launched a new claims \ninitiative that features newly developed training, more \ncustomer-friendly communications and updated banners and \nposters to display at service centers. \nThe initiative also focuses on operational excellence and \nclaims prevention through proper freight handling and helping \nnew employees learn the  \"ABF way\" to load and move freight.ABF Freight is one of the oldest carriers in the industry, and \none of the reasons we are still in business is that we built a \nreputation of delivering quality and Doing It Right The First \nTime. This means delivering customers\u2019 freight on time, \ndamage free and intact. We are known for that. Our customers \nexpect it every time, and our employees proudly strive to meet \ntheir expectations. That\u2019s what the initiative is all about.\nAndy Upchurch\nvice president, service center operations\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2020.pdf", "page": 94, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
