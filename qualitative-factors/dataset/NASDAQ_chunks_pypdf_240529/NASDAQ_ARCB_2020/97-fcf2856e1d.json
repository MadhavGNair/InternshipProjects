{"page_content": "96Wellness \nChampion Story  \nRyan Green, operations supervisor at the Kansas \nCity, Missouri service center and a 2020 ArcBest \nWellness Champion, describes wellness as \u201cbeing \nable to do all the things you set your mind to do \nand never thinking that anything is truly out of \nreach with enough work and perseverance.\u201d \nRyan says he doesn\u2019t have a specific success story \nto share or a feat in one area or another, instead he \nhas a history of well and lean living/eating, with a \nmoderately active daily lifestyle. \n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a time when my family had bad \neating habits. We had an active kitchen, and I \nlearned from the age of 14 to cook dinner for \nmy family. Moving on from family living to being \non my own through college, I never adopted the \ntypical bad habits that some of my peers had. My \nlessons in portion control and eating from the different food groups kept my meals balanced \neven then.\u201d \nInspired by the company\u2019s \u201cDress for Your Day\u201d \npolicy, Ryan also recommends that you \u201cEat for \nYour Day.\u201d \n\u201cAdapting the policy name for wearing the \nappropriate attire for one\u2019s day here at the \ncompany into eating the appropriate food and \nportions for one\u2019s activities can make for an easy \nadaptation to taking the right number of calories \nin each day. ArcBest has an active environment for \nfield employees; I personally walk 6-8 miles on an \naverage day.\u201d  \nRyan doesn\u2019t limit active lifestyle to his workday; \nhe also enjoys going for walks, hiking, rock \nclimbing, rowing, cycling and gardening. \n \nRyan Green\noperations supervisor", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2020.pdf", "page": 97, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
