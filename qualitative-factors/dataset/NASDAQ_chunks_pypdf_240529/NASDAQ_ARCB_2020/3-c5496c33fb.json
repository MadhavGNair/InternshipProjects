As demand for essential \ngoods like food, cleaning supplies and personal protective \nequipment increased, we were there to meet the need. We \nworked to reduce risk of service interruptions, while keeping \nour people and customers safe during pickups, transit and \ndeliveries.  \nOur response to COVID-19 wouldn\u2019t have been possible \nwithout the best of the industry \u2013 our employees. With safety \nas a top priority, and CDC guidelines and employee feedback \nas key informers of our approach, we engaged in initiatives \nto ensure the well-being of our employees including health \nchecks, contact tracing, access to telehealth, and more. We \ncreated learning and development program sessions on \nremote work, stress management and resiliency. We also \nwaived copays for our telehealth provider, Doctor on Demand, \nmaking it easier for our employees to get access to medical \ncare anywhere, anytime. \nAs a company, we are on a diversity and inclusion journey, \nand we are navigating a deliberate path forward to define \nour strategy and goals. Our progress was recognized in the \nForbes 2020 Top 500 List of the Best Employers for Diversity. As part of our workforce strategy, we built on existing veteran \npartnerships by establishing the ABF Military Partnership for \nSupervisors. For this and other efforts, we were proud to be \nincluded in the list of 2021 Military Friendly\u00ae Employers.  \nArcBest is committed to the highest standards of safety, and \neven through the unexpected and ongoing challenges of the \npandemic, we lived our commitment each day.
