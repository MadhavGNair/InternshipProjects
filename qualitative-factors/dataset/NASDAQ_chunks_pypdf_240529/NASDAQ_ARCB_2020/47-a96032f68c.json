Workers\u2019 Compensation Team Launches \nAdvocacy Model  \nThough our Stay Safe goal is to prevent \ninjuries and keep everyone safe, we also \nacknowledge injuries will occur. The \nAdvocacy Model was created by the Workers\u2019 \nCompensation Resolution Team to improve \nthe injured employees\u2019 experience, which can \ngenerally be confusing, frustrating and slow \nto deliver results. \nCommunication and trust are essential for the \nadvocacy model to be successful, so the first \nstep is immediate communication. Once an \ninjury is reported, a team member contacts \nthe injured employee within one business day \nto ask how they\u2019re feeling, provide information \nabout how the claim will be handled and \nanswer any questions they have. \nTo build trust, we apply two of the ArcBest \ncore values: Collaboration (working with the \ninjured employee) and Integrity (looking out \nfor the employee\u2019s best interest).
