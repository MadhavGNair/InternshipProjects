This team takes a deep dive \ninto the injury information at a particular service center to \ndetermine what injuries are being reported and if there are \nany common causes. \nAfter gathering information, members of the Risk \nManagement team travel to the service center to meet with \nmanagement and employees to discuss the injuries and \nsolutions for reducing those injuries. The team spends time \nlooking at the operations and then works together with \nservice center management to create a plan with the goal of \nreducing or preventing injuries moving forward.Employee Spotlight \nHeath joined the company in 2002 and has filled \nseveral safety-related roles over the course of his \ncareer, growing his experience and expertise in this \ncritical area.
