I have traveled 50 \nstates with Panther in the past 16 years as a solo \ntractor driver. As time goes on, it is refreshing to \nknow that if you stop in at the office in Medina, \nOhio, everyone still takes the time to talk to you. \nYou are a business partner, not just a contractor. I \nhave been in just about every vertical that Panther \nhas to offer. From hauling pharmaceuticals one \nday to a military shipment the next. Thank you for \nstanding by me through all these years, Panther!\u201d \nKenneth T. Sawyer SR, Tennessee\u201cWe wish the public would understand that \ntrucking is not as easy as it may appear. It takes \na combination of skill, planning, patience, and \nphysical labor. Both men and women are over \nthe road from all walks of life and work very \nhard! There is an entire community out here to \nmake \"trucking\" happen; truck stops and their \nemployees, rest area attendants, shippers/\nconsignees, dispatchers, shopping centers, \nlaundromats, etc. We appreciate them all! What \nmatters most to drivers is receiving respect for \nthe sacrifices we make while doing our job.\u201d \nMelissa Cheshire and Vincent Louque III, OregonPanther Premium Driver \nSpotlight Stories \nPanther Premium Logistics \nDriver Stories ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2020.pdf", "page": 59, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
