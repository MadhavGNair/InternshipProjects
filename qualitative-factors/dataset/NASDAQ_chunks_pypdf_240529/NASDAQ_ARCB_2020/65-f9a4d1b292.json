{"page_content": "64Fleet Innovation  \nIn 2019, ArcBest Technologies began working with Samsara, a \nleader in Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), to meet electronic \nlogging device (ELD) compliance requirements for ABF \nFreight. Since establishing this partnership, we have deployed \n32 new API endpoints that connected our internal systems \nwith the Samsara platform, and we have integrated Samsara\u2019s \nHours of Service (HOS) data with our in-house compliance \ntool. This helped us reduce the time spent managing \nunassigned HOS by 50%. Collaboration with Samsara has also \nled to an innovative, customized digital platform that meets \noperational needs, driver needs, and customer needs more \nefficiently and cost effectively.\nAs a result of this investment, we were honored to receive \nfrom Samsara a 2020 Top Fleet Award for Fleet Innovator. \nThis award is given to fleets that are technology-forward \nproblem solvers and use telematics and API integrations to \nimprove operations. ArcBest was among the five Top Fleet \nwinners for 2020.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2020.pdf", "page": 65, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
