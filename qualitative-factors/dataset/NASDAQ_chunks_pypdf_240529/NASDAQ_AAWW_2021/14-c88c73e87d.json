{"page_content": "ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE    2021 ESG Report     14\nElectrification of Our Ground Operations Vehicles\nAs part of our strategy to reduce our GHG emissions, Atlas \nhas begun to invest in hybrid and electric fleet vehicles. \nCurrently, 10% of our vehicle fleet is comprised of hybrid and \nelectric vehicles, with plans for this percentage to increase \nto approximately 50% by 2030. Our transition to hybrid and \nelectric vehicles is being led by our Polar division, which has \nbeen progressively rolling out hybrid and electric cars and \nvans to replace gas-powered vehicles. Today, 40% of Polar\u2019s \nvehicles are powered by alternative fuel sources, with this \nnumber expected to grow in the coming years. \nAdditionally, we have begun to transition our equipment, \nincluding forklifts, to hybrid and electric options where \npossible. Presently, 6% of our equipment is electric or hybrid, \nand we are exploring opportunities to increase that percentage \nwhen we have the opportunity to replace older equipment. As \npart of these efforts, we plan to replace all propane and diesel \nforklifts at our facilities with electric alternatives.\nAircraft Emissions", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAWW_2021.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
