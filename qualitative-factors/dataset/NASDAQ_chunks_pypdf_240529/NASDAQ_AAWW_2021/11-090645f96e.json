Atlas President \nand Chief Executive Officer John Dietrich serves \non the Board of Directors at A4A, and a number \nof individuals serve on A4A councils, committees \nand working groups that contribute to sector-wide \nenvironmental and sustainability advocacy, such \nas the Environmental Sustainability Council and \nthe Sustainable Aviation Fuel Committee. Our work \nwith our industry peers through these A4A groups \nsupports the trade association\u2019s climate and SAF \ngoals (net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and \nincreasing SAF availability to U.S. aircraft operations \nto 3 billion gallons by 2030), address an array of \nenvironmental impacts, including aircraft noise and \nlocal air quality, advance our own ESG initiatives and \nencourage private-public partnerships.\nWe believe that coordinating efforts maximizes  \nour collective voice when it comes to advocacy and \npublic policy issues, both of which are critical to \nmeeting environmental stewardship goals across  \nthe aviation industry.\n\u25ca Aviation Is a Relatively Small Contributor\n \u00bbDomestic U.S. commercial aviation  \n= 2% GHGs (Source: U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency)\n \u00bbWorldwide aviation = 2% (Source: \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)\n\u25ca Commercial Passenger and Cargo Carriers Have \na Strong Domestic Record (Source: A4A)\n \u00bbImproved fuel efficiency more than  \n135% between 1978 and 2019\n \u00bbSaved over 5 billion metric tons of CO2 \n(equivalent to taking 27 million cars off the \nroad each year since 1978)Understanding Our Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nIn 2021, Atlas worked to formalize the structure of our \nemissions reporting strategy. We partnered with a third-\nparty environmental consultant and engaged with internal \nand external stakeholders to establish our GHG emissions \nreporting strategy. Our approach is to align with leading \nglobal standards and frameworks, including the Task Force \non Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the \nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). See the \nAppendix  of this report for our TCFD and SASB disclosures.\nTo support the industry goal and meet our target, we are \nfocused on three key areas:\n\u25ca Continuing to drive operational efficiency, especially for \nour aircraft\n\u25ca Upgrading our fleet with more fuel-efficient aircraft\n\u25ca Expanding our use of SAF when possible\nATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE    2021 ESG Report     11Our leaders are proud to contribute their thought \nleadership and expertise to industry association \nboards and councils.
