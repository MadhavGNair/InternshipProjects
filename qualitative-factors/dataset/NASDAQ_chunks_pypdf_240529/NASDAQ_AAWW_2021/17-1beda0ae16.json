{"page_content": "ATLAS AIR WORLDWIDE   2021 ESG Report     17\nReducing Resource Consumption\nENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR  \nNEW FACILITIES\nAs we plan for the development and construction \nof new facilities, we are focused on challenging \nthe status quo and integrating forward-looking \nenvironmental principles and practices related to \nsafety, energy efficiency, electrification of equipment \nand the ground fleet \u2013 all while continuing to provide \nunparalleled levels of customer service.\nKey considerations include:\n\u25ca Reducing use of material handling equipment via \ninstallation of material handling systems. Using \ntruck docks, roller decks and vertical conveyors \ndecreases the need for forklifts and tugs/dollies. \nReduced truck dwell times also minimizes transit \ntime emissions during idling.\n\u25ca Converting material handling equipment from \nfossil fuel to electric, which provides a healthier \nwork environment and reduces emissions.\n\u25ca Maximizing use of vertical storage in warehouses \nto enhance capacity within the same footprint and \nbuilding infrastructure.\n\u25ca Ensuring appropriate infrastructure to support \nelectric vehicle charging for passenger/light \ncommercial vehicles, commercial trucks and \nelectric cargo loaders and transporters.\n\u25ca Introducing sustainable energy sources, including \nrooftop solar arrays, regenerative technology used \nto recapture energy, and on-site battery storage \nsystems used to offset spikes in demand  \nfor electricity.\n\u25ca Employing smart panel technology to monitor \nelectrical consumption of our equipment, which \nenhances preventive maintenance and  \nenergy efficiency.Local Actions Make a Difference\nOur local approach to resource conservation has resulted in the \ndevelopment of a variety of programs and strategies at our sites. \nSteps we are taking to reduce our resource consumption include:\n\u25ca Incorporating recycling and waste separation programs   \nat our facilities. \n\u25ca Using energy use reduction systems , such as LED lighting \nand high-efficiency HVAC systems, in all new facilities, \nincluding at our operations center in Northern Kentucky, \nwhere we also offer electric vehicle charging stations for \nvisitors and staff. \n\u25ca Continuing to invest in sustainable options  for shoring and \ndunnage supplies, including lumber that is recyclable at the \nend of its service life. We also try to extend the life of shoring \nmaterial used to support special cargo during transport. \n\u25ca Utilizing electronic flight plans and electronic logbooks   \nto reduce paper use and consumption. \n\u25ca Exploring WELL Building Standard and Green Building \nInitiative (GBI) certification  to verify the environmental, \nhealth and wellness performance of our buildings. \n\u25ca Using biodegradable plastic  to wrap cargo to help  \nreduce waste. \n\u25ca Coordinating the cleaning of crew blankets for donation   \nto homeless shelters or pet rescue organizations at airports. \nAs we continue to develop our forward-looking environmental \nstrategy, Atlas will remain committed to pursuing objectives \nthat allow us to demonstrate our global leadership in managing \nenergy, carbon, water, and waste throughout our global locations.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAWW_2021.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
