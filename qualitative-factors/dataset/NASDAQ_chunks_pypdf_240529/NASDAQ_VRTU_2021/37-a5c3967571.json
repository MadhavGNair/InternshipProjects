All leaders at the manager \nlevel and above are also assessed for behavioral indicators with the Harrison Assessment Test.\nPrograms such as REPS (real-time engagement and performance scores), AI-powered surveys, talent-trend predictive \nanalytics, and Engineering IQ (EIQ) programs enable an ecosystem in which high-performing talent thrives.\nOur compensation practices are similarly carefully tailored to the three P\u2019s \u2014 pay for person, pay for position, and pay for \nperformance. We link both our base salary and our variable pay to individual  performance and company performance. \nWe benchmark regularly, and employees can be confident that our compensation is equitable and aligned with the \nmarket.
