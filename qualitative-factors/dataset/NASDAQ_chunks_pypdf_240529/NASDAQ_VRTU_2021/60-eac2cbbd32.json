We do not have an internal price on carbon, but we intend to set one in the next two years.\nIn addition to our GHG emissions targets, we have a target to increase low-carbon energy consumption, from 11% in 2019 to 40% in 2030. \nWe also have a target to reduce per-employee water usage by 40% by 2035, compared to a 2017 base year. Virtusa tracks additional climate-related metrics, including energy per square foot per month and kiloliters of water consumption per employee (not FTE) per month.\n\u2022 ESG Report: Environment\n\u2022 ESG Databook: Environmental performance data\n\u2022 CDP 2022 Climate Change response:\n\u2022 (C1.3a) Incentives provided for the management of climate-related issues\n\u2022 (C4.2a, C4.2b) Other climate-related targets\n\u2022 (C9.1) Additional climate-related metrics\nb.
