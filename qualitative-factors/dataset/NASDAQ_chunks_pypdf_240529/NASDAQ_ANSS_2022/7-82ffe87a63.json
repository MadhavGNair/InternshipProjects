Materiality assessments help companies identify, prioritize, and strategize relevant ESG topics \nthat can have an impact on society, the environment, and their businesses. The list of topics used in the assessment was created by \nconducting internal business research and external research and benchmarking, including relevant frameworks. \nThe list of topics (in alphabetical order):\n\u2022 Accessibility \u2022 Global Diversity and Inclusion\n\u2022 Board Compensation, Independence, and Diversity \u2022 Innovation and Digitalization\n\u2022 Business Resilience and Adaptation \u2022 Intellectual Property Rights\n\u2022 Community Education, Development, and Impact \u2022 Public Policy Engagement\n\u2022 Data Protection and Security  \u2022 Responsible Procurement\n\u2022 Decent Work \u2022 Responsible Product Use\n\u2022 Employee Health, Safety, and Wellness \u2022 Talent Acquisition, Retention, Development, and Growth\n\u2022 Energy and Climate \u2022 Tech Solutions for Societal Challenges (Product Handprint)\n\u2022 Ethical Business Practices and Compliance \u2022 Water and Waste Management\nThe primary inputs to the assessment were a series of internal and external interviews conducted with key stakeholders. These \ninterviews were also supplemented with an online employee survey deployed across all main functional areas at Ansys. The issues were \nthen scored based on their relative impact on society and the environment and their impact on the business.  \nLastly, we validated the outcomes of the assessment with a workshop with our internal subject matter expert interviewees, where \nthe assessment results were affirmed. We will use this assessment to inform our reporting and strategy, along with setting goals and \nmetrics around the priority materiality topics. We will periodically refresh the assessment moving forward.\n1 Our Corporate Responsibility Report details the topics we consider to be most important to our stakeholders when evaluating ESG issues at Ansys.  \nReferences to materiality refer to such terms in the context of ESG reporting and strategy and does not directly correspond to the concept of materiality \nfor purposes of the U.S. federal securities laws.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANSS_2022.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
