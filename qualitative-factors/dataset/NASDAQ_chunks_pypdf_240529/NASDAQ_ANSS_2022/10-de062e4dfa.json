From that small beginning, enormous data centers have grown to fulfill the needs of modern society. A data center may \nhouse thousands of computers to act as servers, data storage devices, network equipment, power transformers and for many other \nuses. Together, they consume a significant amount of power and generate a considerable amount of heat, requiring the data center \nto be cooled to prevent the computers from overheating and crashing. Our simulation solutions are important in developing IT \nequipment with higher performance per watt to improve energy efficiency in data centers.PRODUCT HANDPRINT\nOur product handprint use cases show how simulation can help our customers across  \nmany industries achieve their sustainability objectives. Our customers are aiming to  \naccelerate technical innovation needed to develop new technologies of the future  \nat the pace our planet needs now.\n1.
