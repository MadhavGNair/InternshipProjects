{"page_content": "Eco-Design and Circularity\nMattel is committed to reducing waste and resource \nconsumption in its value chain. We implement various \neco-design and circular economy principles in the \ndevelopment of our products and packaging. Eco-\ndesign principles consider the environmental impact of \nthe product or package during its entire life cycle, while \ncircular design principles aim to create products that no \nlonger have a life cycle with a beginning, a middle, and an \nend. Circular design principles support products that aim \nto be made and remade again. Rigorous Safety Standards in Material Selection\nAs part of our rigorous safety protocols, we apply strict \nguidelines to select materials that will be used in our \nproducts and packaging: \n\u2022 We do not use polycarbonate (which may contain traces \nof bisphenol A) in any product intended to be mouthed \nor to touch food. \n\u2022 We do not add chemicals to our products as flame \nretardants, except when required by law, and we \ncarefully restrict which flame retardants we use when \nthey are required.\u2022 We clearly label products that contain latex, such as \nFisher-Price teethers, in case of allergies. \n\u2022 We test for lead and other heavy metals in our raw \nmaterials before using them in products. \n\u2022 We sample materials used in our products to ensure \nthey do not contain polycyclic-aromatic hydrocarbons \n(PAHs), formaldehyde, or other substances of concern, \nas required by regulations worldwide, such as EU \nregulations like Registration, Evaluation, Authorization \nand Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).With these principles in mind, we are designing more of \nour products for durability, recycling, recovery, and to \nreuse products, components, and materials. We also aim \nto make effective use of recycled content and other more \nsustainable materials that help support a circular economy. \nLeveraging in-house and third-party life cycle assessment \n(LCA) tools, we are working to optimize product design and \ndevelopment choices to help reduce our environmental \nimpact. We are also identifying solutions to advance a \ncircular economy, including by collaborating with other \ncompanies on these solutions.  \nRECYCLINGMAKE\nRAW\nMATERIALS\nREMAKE \nPRODUCT\nREPAIR\nUSESELL \n& DELIVERPUT \nTOGETHER \nPRODUCTSPUT \nTOGETHER \nPIECES\nREUSECircular Economy Model Quality, safety, and value define  \nour products.\nQuality \nWe put the consumer experience at the center of our \ninnovation by creating products with purposeful play.
