{"page_content": "1. TRIR is expressed as the number of recordable incidents per 100 full-time workers during a one-year period and covers all Mattel employees, contingent workers, and independent \ncontractors performing tasks on-site at Mattel-owned and/or -operated manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. The calculation is based on a total of 200,000 hours/year, \nwhich is the benchmark established by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration.Packaging Materials (GRI 301-1)\n(in % of Metric Tons)20191\n% of Total Volume of \nMaterials for Packaging% of Volume That Is \nSustainable2\nTotal Packaging Materials by Type 100% 95.4%\nPaper 84.5% 47% recycled\n48% FSC-certified\nPlastic 15.5% 35% recycled3\n99.5% recyclable\n0% bio-based\n1.

For the purposes of this table, \u201csustainable\u201d means: (a) for paper: recycled or FSC-certified content (virgin content only; content that bears the FSC controlled wood certification \nhas been excluded due to associated high risk of deforestation); and (b) for plastic: recycled, recyclable, or bio-based content, where \u201crecycled\u201d content includes both pre-and \npost-consumer recycled content and where \u201crecyclable\u201d is based on a \u201crecycle ready\u201d definition.\n3. For the purposes of this calculation, recycled plastic includes plastic packaging materials containing 25% or more recycled materials. \n1. For the purposes of this table, \u201csustainable\u201d means recycled or FSC-certified content (virgin content only; content that bears the FSC controlled wood certification has been \nreported under other certified origin due to associated high risk of deforestation). Due to rounding, percentages may not sum.\n2. Data for 2020 is not yet available. Due to delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect 2020 data will be validated by the Rainforest Alliance in September 2021.\n3. Total consumption of timber-based materials (in WRME) was estimated based on Mattel internal procurement data, which was provided to a third-party sustainability service \nsoftware provider for aggregation and reporting; data for 2018 and 2019 has been validated by the Rainforest Alliance. 1.
