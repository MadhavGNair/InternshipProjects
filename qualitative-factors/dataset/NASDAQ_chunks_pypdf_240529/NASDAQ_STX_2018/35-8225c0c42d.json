{"page_content": "FY2018 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP ANNUAL REPORT\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY036 \nTotal internal electricity consumption \ndecreased to 1.567 million megawatt \nhours (MWh), from 1.633 million MWh in \nFY2017. We shipped 338 EB of storage \ncapacity in FY2018, resulting in a total of \n4634 MWh per EB of storage capacity \nshipped, down from 6220 MWh per EB \nof storage capacity shipped in FY2017. \nThis accounts for a 25 percent reduction \nin electricity consumption from FY2017 \nto FY2018, reflective of our ongoing \ncommitment to responsible energy use.\nHigher-capacity drives tend to require \nan increased amount of energy to \nmanufacture, and normalizing our \nenergy consumption per storage \ncapacity shipped demonstrates \nour continued progress toward and \ncommitment to energy efficiency\u2014\naligned to our value of Innovation. Seagate also continues to focus efforts \non energy conservation throughout \nour operations. In FY2018, we saved \n39,000 MWh of electricity, exceeding \nour conservation goal of 20,000 MWh \nby nearly double. Energy savings are \ncalculated using the Metered Baseline \nMethod (MBM); since FY2014, the site-\ninitiated energy conservation projects \nhave saved a cumulative 154,000 MWh. \nOur conservation goal for FY2019 is \n10,000 MWh.\nAt our design centers in Singapore and \nFremont, California, we generated a total \nof 1540 MWh of renewable, solar energy \nthroughout FY2018. Our manufacturing \nsites in Wuxi, China, and Londonderry, \nNorthern Ireland, are certified to ISO \n50001 Energy Management System.Energy\nAccumulated Energy Saved (MWh) since FY14\nAccumulated \nsince FY14\nEnergy Saved \nin current FY\nFY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19\nProjected180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nThousand MWh", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2018.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
