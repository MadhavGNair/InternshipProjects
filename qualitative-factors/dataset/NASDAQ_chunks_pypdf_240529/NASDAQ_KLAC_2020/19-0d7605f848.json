{"page_content": "Content IndexFor self-driving cars, positional accuracy can mean \nthe difference between a smooth ride and a serious \naccident. The 5G communication technologies \nused in self-driving vehicles will rely on the same \nradio frequency technology used in smartphones. \nKLA has been at the heart of that technology \nsince the late 1990s, supplying etch, chemical \nvapor deposition and physical vapor deposition \nequipment to radio frequency leaders such as \nQorvo, Skyworks and WIN Semiconductor.  \nAutonomous vehicles will also generate huge \namounts of data from hundreds of sensors inside \nthe vehicle. Our process chambers are used by \nmanufacturers of micro-electronmechanical \nsystems (MEMS) to develop high-resolution \ngyroscopes that help detect acceleration and \nrotation in cars to ensure a safe journey.\nMEMS microphones are also used inside self-\ndriving cars for voice control, as well as listening for \nengine noises or emergency vehicles approaching. \nManufacturers use our etch equipment to produce \nthese types of microphones.Self-Driving CarsInnovating for \na More Sustainable \nBusiness\nThe Continuous Improvement Program \nat SPTS shows just how multidimensional \ninnovation is across KLA. For the past \nseven years, SPTS has showcased the best \nof its employee-led projects at its annual \nContinuous Improvement Day. Projects \nfocus on improving work practices or \nproducts that contribute to the sustainability \nof the business and/or demonstrate return \non investment. Winning projects from 2020 \nachieved $1.2 million in savings, and to date, \nthe various projects have saved SPTS over \n$6 million. \nIn 2019, KLA became the first semiconductor equipment company to be accepted \nas an associate member of the Automotive Electronics Council. The council sets \nqualification standards for electronic components in the automotive industry. As \na member, KLA works collaboratively with the automotive industry to develop \nZero Defect strategies that improve automotive reliability. 2019\u20132020 \nGLOBAL IMPACT \nREPORT \nIntroduction\nOur ESG Strategy  \nCEO Message \nBusiness Snapshot \nand ESG Highlights  \nAdvancing \nHumanity  \nAdvancing \nInnovation\nAdvancing \nStewardship\n  \nAdvancing \nOpportunity  \nAdvancing \nLeadership   \n18", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2020.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
