These are voluntary groups of \nemployees who have a common interest in helping KLA achieve its inclusion and diversity goals. ERGs are a fundamental part of our inclusion and diversity strategy. \nThey give colleagues an opportunity to come together to share openly, promote and elevate awareness on important issues, and help the company gain a better \nunderstanding of what it needs to do to be more inclusive and diverse.
