We seek out \nsuppliers who share our strong values; treat their \nemployees with dignity, respect and fairness; \nand meet the strict requirements in our Code of \nConduct to keep our supply chain free from any \nhuman trafficking and labor violations.\nIn 2020, the combination of global supply chain \ndisruptions, our strategic focus on inclusion and \ndiversity across our business, and the demand \nfor continuous innovation highlighted the \nneed and opportunity for a more diverse and \nsustainable supply chain\u2014one that aligns with \nour ESG strategy and supports our commitment \nto inclusion and diversity. In response, we \ncreated a three-year strategic plan that will help \nus minimize supply chain disruptions and bring \non partners who will help achieve our inclusion \nand diversity goals.\n This journey is just beginning. In 2020, we \nlaid a strong foundation by contracting with \na third-party partner to compare our supplier \nlists with public sources that identify and \ntrack diverse supplier categories, such as \nwomen-owned businesses, minority-owned \nbusinesses and others. As a result of this work, \nwe have increased the number of identified \ndiverse suppliers already in our supply chain \nby 242%. In 2021, we will continue working to \nbring our strategic plan to fruition, identifying \ngoals and metrics, tracking our progress and \nenlisting champions in each organization to \nhelp us create even more sustainable, inclusive \nand diverse supply chains throughout our \noperations.\nThe collective impact of industry leaders is \nfurthering our efforts beyond KLA. In 2019, \nwe partnered with Intel, Micron and Applied \nMaterials as an early member of a working \ngroup called the SEMI MOD (Manufacturing \nOwnership Diversity). The mission of SEMI MOD \nis to promote more diverse supply chains in \nsemiconductor manufacturing and drive the \ninclusion of such businesses. Additionally, \nin 2020, KLA became a Corporate Member \nof the Western Regional Minority Supplier \nDevelopment Council to further expand our \nawareness of business opportunities with \ncertified minority business enterprises. \n2019\u20132020 \nGLOBAL IMPACT \nREPORT \nIntroduction\nOur ESG Strategy  \nCEO Message \nBusiness Snapshot \nand ESG Highlights  \nAdvancing \nHumanity  \nAdvancing \nInnovation\nAdvancing \nStewardship\n  \nAdvancing \nOpportunity  \nAdvancing \nLeadership   \n43", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2020.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
