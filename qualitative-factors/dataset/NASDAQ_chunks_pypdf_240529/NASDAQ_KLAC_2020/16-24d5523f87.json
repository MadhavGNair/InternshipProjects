Every \nsingle step involves process tools and \na tremendous amount of materials. \nIf something goes wrong at any of \nthese steps and the chips don\u2019t meet \nthe quality standards, they have to \nbe scrapped. KLA\u2019s solutions can help \nprevent this waste.\u201d\nRob Cappel\nSenior Director, Market Research and AnalyticsHelping Fabs Make Greener Choices\nFabs are reducing process excursions by adding inspection and metrology steps. Earlier \ndetection of process excursions results in faster time-to-corrective action and significantly less \nyield loss and material wasted. The example below shows an excursion happening at process \nstep two, and demonstrates the environmental savings associated with finding that excursion by \ninspecting at process step three as opposed to waiting until process step five. \n2019\u20132020 \nGLOBAL IMPACT \nREPORT \nIntroduction\nOur ESG Strategy  \nCEO Message \nBusiness Snapshot \nand ESG Highlights  \nAdvancing \nHumanity  \nAdvancing \nInnovation\nAdvancing \nStewardship\n  \nAdvancing \nOpportunity  \nAdvancing \nLeadership   \n15\n1\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 2\nscrap\nscrap\n~11500\nkWh~54600 \nliters~368\nkg", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2020.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
