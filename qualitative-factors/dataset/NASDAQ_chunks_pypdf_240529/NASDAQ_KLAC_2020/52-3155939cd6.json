{"page_content": "Content IndexThe assessment measured eight key areas, including: awareness of our business ethics and compliance \nprogram, perception of our function, reporting misconduct, pressure to compromise standards, \norganizational justice, and perception of supervisors, leadership, co-workers and the work environment. \nHere\u2019s what we found:\nAs KLA has grown through acquisitions, new hires, \nentering new markets and seizing other new \nopportunities, our leaders recognized the need to \nevolve our ethics and compliance program. That\u2019s \nwhy in 2019, KLA hired our first full-time chief \ncompliance officer who has built our dedicated \nethics and compliance team. \nWe also continued to mature our programs \nthrough the development of a compliance \neffectiveness program, which includes assessing \nKLA\u2019s most significant criminal and regulatory risks \nand ensuring that we have effective compliance \nprograms to prevent, detect and remediate issues \nas they arise. \nIn addition, we conducted several internal and \nexternal reviews of certain programs, such as \nour trade compliance and privacy programs, and \nidentified opportunities to further enhance and \nmature our initiatives. We\u2019ve also refined our \ntraining offerings to ensure that our employees \nknow what\u2019s expected of them.
