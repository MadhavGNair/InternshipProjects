The KLA Foundation also supports an all-girls robotics team in Korea.\nIn 2020, we provided funding for the Agastya Women\u2019s Program in India to set up and operate a mobile \nscience laboratory for children. Because COVID-19 prohibited social gatherings, the program pivoted to \ndigital summer camps with activities to help kids explore science topics ranging from chemistry to pollution \nto nuclear physics.\nWe also provided seed funding to Bay Area Tutoring Association for their COVID-19 Tutoring Pods, which \nprovided tutoring services for children of Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) healthcare workers.  \n\u201cKLA Foundation\u2019s partnership has helped Bay Area Tutoring Association be intentional \nwith social justice initiatives during COVID-19, like locating students of African ancestry \nin the Bay Area whose parents are essential workers.
