As part of KLA\u2019s \nmission to advance humanity, we\u2019re always at the forefront of what\u2019s next. Examples include:\nTrailblazing Technologies \nfor the Greater Good\n\u201cOur tools are fundamental to the \nsemiconductor, package and printed \ncircuit board industry, extending \nbenefits into the systems that \nuse them.\u201d \nChet Lenox\nSenior Director, Industry and Customer Collaboration, KLAWe provided etch hardware to companies developing infrared sensing, the technology used in \nairport screening. By keeping wafers free of contamination, our etch hardware provides a lower \nresistance interface, which reduces the amount of energy consumed. \nThis platform can detect disease in microdroplets of blood in less than 10 minutes, compared \nwith the current 24-hour time frame. The underlying technology uses microchannels in silicon \netched with our Omega\u00ae etch systems.\nKLA solutions play an important role in the treatment of heart conditions, blood vessel \nblockages, and diseases of the liver, gallbladder and eyes. Our physical vapor deposition \ntechnology is a market leader in the deposition of the piezoelectric thin films at the heart of \nthese ultrasonic emitters and sensors.\nWe\u2019re involved in manufacturing many of the critical microelectronics inside current and future \ncars, including self-driving and electric vehicles.\n\u2022 Our etch and chemical vapor deposition systems are used to make high-brightness LEDs \nfor car front and rear light clusters.\n\u2022 Our physical vapor deposition systems are used in the manufacture of switches and \ntransistor power controllers.The power chips used in ventilators built during the pandemic were created with our physical \nvapor deposition equipment.
