We track our usage, strive to source \nmore recycled water and less freshwater, and \nwork to keep contaminants out of the storm drain \nand ground.\nWe\u2019ve implemented programs to reduce our \nfreshwater use and engage employees in water \nconservation efforts. This includes environmental Water Wise in Israel\nOur Orbotech site implemented a fresh-\nwater reduction program with multiple \ninitiatives inside and out:\n\u2022 Purchasing low-flow toilets\n\u2022 Using AC condensation \nwater for irrigation\n\u2022 Planting water-wise plants\n\u2022 Redesigning irrigation \nsystems and watering lines\n\u2022 Reducing water vaporization \nby replacing some garden \nareas with volcanic stones\nmanagement training for employees and \ncontractors, as well as improvements in campus \nlandscaping management. For example, we \nuse NEWater in Singapore for irrigation on \nour grounds as well as in our cooling towers\u2014\nreturning water to our watersheds. In Milpitas, we \nuse high-quality reclaimed water, which has been \npurified by the Santa Clara Valley Water District \nSilicon Valley Advanced Water Purification Center. \nWhile these programs help us reduce freshwater \nuse, we saw a 20% increase in freshwater \nconsumption at our Milpitas facilities in 2019 due \nto an addition of a large cleanroom, increased \nevaporation on our cooling towers and a larger \nemployee population. \nAs we continue to expand our operations, we \nwill maintain our efforts to conserve water by \nincreasing the efficiency of our operations. \n2019\u20132020 \nGLOBAL IMPACT \nREPORT \nIntroduction\nOur ESG Strategy  \nCEO Message \nBusiness Snapshot \nand ESG Highlights  \nAdvancing \nHumanity  \nAdvancing \nInnovation\nAdvancing \nStewardship\n  \nAdvancing \nOpportunity  \nAdvancing \nLeadership   \n29", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2020.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
