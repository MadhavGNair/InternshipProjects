Since opening our \nAnn Arbor office in 2019, we\u2019ve achieved 50% women in site leadership roles (director and above) and almost a third (29%) of our employees overall are women.  \nOur Mosaic ERG originated at our Ann Arbor site and the group sponsors a variety of inclusion and diversity activities. For example, we invited a state senator and \ncommunity leader in Detroit to engage us in conversation around issues within the the Black/African American community. We also celebrated Pride month by \nwatching \u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d followed by a facilitated discussion on the diversity issues it surfaced, such as LGBTQ+, disabilities and women\u2019s empowerment, \nand how these issues continue to impact people today.\nThe work we\u2019ve done in Ann Arbor is now being used as a pilot for how we can improve our hiring and retention processes to be more inclusive across all KLA locations.Inclusive From the Start in Ann Arbor2019\u20132020 \nGLOBAL IMPACT \nREPORT \nAsianFemale\nWhiteMale\nBlack or African American\nHispanic or Latinx\nNative American, \nNative Hawaiian, Pacific Islander \nMultiracialRace & Ethnicity: \nAnn ArborGender: \nAnn Arbor\nOverall\n60%70%80%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nLeadership Non-tech Tech OverallTechNon-techLeadershipJob Type\nPercent\n54%\n35%\n4% 3%0%2%43%51%\n2% 1% 0% 1%70%\n13%\n7% 6%\n0%3%71%\n7%14%\n0% 0% 0%Introduction\nOur ESG Strategy  \nCEO Message \nBusiness Snapshot \nand ESG Highlights  \nAdvancing \nHumanity  \nAdvancing \nInnovation\nAdvancing \nStewardship\n  \nAdvancing \nOpportunity  \nAdvancing \nLeadership   \n33", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLAC_2020.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
