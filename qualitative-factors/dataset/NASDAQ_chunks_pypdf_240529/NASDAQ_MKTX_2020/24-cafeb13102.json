Based on their responses, our overall employee \nengagement measured at 78%, slightly above the global average \nfor financial services and high-tech companies as reported by \nMercer | Sirota. To conduct this survey, we presented questions and \nstatements to our employees related to the following eight categories: \n\u2022 Agility & Innovation \n\u2022 Confidence \n\u2022 Employee Experience\n\u2022 Engagement \n\u2022 Immediate Manager Effectiveness \n\u2022 Performance Enablement \n\u2022 Senior Leadership Effectiveness \n\u2022 Strategic Focus \nScoring for each question in the survey was based on a 1 to 6 scale, \nrepresenting a five point scale of strongly agrees to strongly disagrees, \nwith an additional option for Don\u2019t Know / Not Applicable. There were \nalso two open comment questions.\nIn 2020, MarketAxess completed a pulse survey, conducted by Mind \nGym, focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The survey found \nthat 92% of respondents felt that MarketAxess was an inclusive \nenvironment, with 87% of employees participating in the survey. \nThe survey explored perceptions of how much employees feel they \nbelong, how valued they feel for their unique qualities and the extent \nto which MarketAxess is equitable. These core constructs were \nmeasured at both the individual and organizational level. Leadership \ninclusiveness was also measured.\nMarketAxess plans to conduct another employee engagement survey \nin 2021 and will report the results of such survey in its 2021 ESG \nReport.
