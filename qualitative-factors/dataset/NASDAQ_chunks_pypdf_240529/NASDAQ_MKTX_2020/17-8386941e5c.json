{"page_content": "34ESG REPORT\nClimate\nMindful of our environmental footprint, we \nmake concentrated efforts to reduce our \nenvironmental impact. Due to the nature of \nour business, we do not manufacture or ship \nphysical products that create or contribute \nto pollution. In our view, the most material \nenvironmental impacts we currently make is \nthrough air travel, and the operation of our \nleased office spaces and data centers. \nAs we develop our environmental  \nsustainability strategy, we are engaging  \nwith a consulting partner to measure and \nmanage our carbon footprint, and help us  \nput measurable goals in place, which we \nexpect to introduce in the 2022 report.  \nWe are also evaluating a variety of climate-  \nrelated standards against which it would be \nuseful to report, such as CDP and TCFD, and \nwill continue to deepen our commitment in \nthis area in the coming years. \n20%25%30%40\n36\n32\n28\n24\n20\n16\n12\n8\n4\n0\n2018 2019 202015%\n10%\n0%Green Bond Trading on MarketAxess\n*Estimated MarketAxess share of corporate and municipal green bond\ntrading by dollar volume reported to TRACEEstimated U.S. Market Share*MarketAxess Global Green Bond Trading Volume $BilMarketAxess Global \nTrade Volume $Bil\nEstimated U.S. \nMarket Share*Legend", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MKTX_2020.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
