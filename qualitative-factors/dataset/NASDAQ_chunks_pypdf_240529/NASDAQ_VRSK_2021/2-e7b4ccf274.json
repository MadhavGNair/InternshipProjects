{"page_content": "A Message to Our Stakeholders / 1\nA Message to Our Stakeholders\nThroughout Verisk\u2019s 50+ year history, \none thing has remained constant: our \nproducts and services help empower \nbusiness and society.\nThis approach is supported by many \nexamples. Studies have confirmed \nthat the municipal fire protection \nevaluations we conduct on behalf of \nthe insurance industry in the United \nStates ultimately help local communi -\nties plan for, budget, and justify \nimprovements in their fire protection. \nOur extreme event models enable the \nprivate and public sectors to prepare \nfor natural disasters\u2014work that \nultimately saves lives and mitigates \nproperty loss. In addition, the research \nwe conduct in conjunction with our \nglobal risk analytics informs custom -\ners and policymakers about important \nsocial issues ranging from child labor \nto the economic effects of climate \nchange on agriculturally based \neconomies.\nNot surprisingly, the same theme \nechoes throughout our 2021  Corporate \nSocial Responsibility Report.  A diverse \ncross-section of internal and external \nstakeholders identified \u201cDeliver Services that Empower Business and \nSociety\u201d as the first priority in a formal \nSustainability Strategy designed to \nmaximize value for stakeholders. It \nresonates in the individual entries of \nthe \u201cWorking with Purpose\u201d section,  \nan annual feature of great interest to \nour employees and prospective job \ncandidates. And you\u2019ll hear it again in \nthe words of our charitable partners\u2014 \nGeoHazards International, the Interna -\ntional Rescue Committee, Team \nRubicon, Year Up, and The Bowery \nMission\u2014that have been invited to \ndescribe how Verisk\u2019s analytics, tools, \nor expertise help advance their efforts.\nWe\u2019re humbled to be the stewards  \nof such a legacy, and we're mindful  \nof its importance to the success of  \nour sustainability journey. It underlies  \nour enthusiasm for addressing the \nopportunities presented by climate \nchange as described in this year\u2019s \n\u201cClimate Disclosure Report.\u201d It \nreinforces our focus on employee \nengagement and our commitment  \nto diversity and inclusion, two areas \nwhere \u201cgood\u201d should never be good \nenough.Another year of COVID-19 and its \nvariants may have changed the nature \nof the workplace, but it hasn\u2019t changed \nthe nature of our work. My colleagues \nat Verisk\u2014the professionals who bring \nour products and services to life, and \neach member of our Board\u2014remain \nfocused and committed to the \nimportant environmental, social, and \ngovernance considerations driving \nlong-term value creation for our \nstakeholders.\nAs I prepare to retire from this great \ncompany in May 2022, I couldn\u2019t be \nprouder of the strides we\u2019ve made to \nempower a better, more resilient, and \nsustainable tomorrow for customers \nand societies.\nSincerely,\nScott G. Stephenson\nChairman, President,  \nand Chief Executive Officer\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VRSK_2021.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
