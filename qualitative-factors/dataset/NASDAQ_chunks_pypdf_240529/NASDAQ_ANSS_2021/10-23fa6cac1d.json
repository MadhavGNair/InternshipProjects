A big challenge to the widespread deployment and adoption of autonomous \nvehicles (AVs) is demonstrating that they are safe. Physically driving the number of miles needed to assure this safety is impractical.  \nThe answer is simulation. Companies are able to drive millions of virtual miles per day. This contrasts with the nearly two million miles \nof physical testing conducted by companies on California\u2019s roads in 2020.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANSS_2021.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
