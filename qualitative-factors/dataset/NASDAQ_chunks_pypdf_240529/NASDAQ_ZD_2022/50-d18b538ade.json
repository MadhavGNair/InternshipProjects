In \nthis report we are restating our 2021 Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG \nemissions due to refinements in our methodology discussed in note 14 on \npage 66. We have also improved our method for calculating our data storage \ncapacity and so prior year data has not been included for that disclosure on \npage 65 because it is not comparable.
