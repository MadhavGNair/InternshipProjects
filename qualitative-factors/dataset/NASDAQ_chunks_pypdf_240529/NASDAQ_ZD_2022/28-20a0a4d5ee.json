All \nbusiness units are required to comply with the policy. However, because \nof the diverse nature of our companies and the products they offer, \nthe policy identifies the necessary components of business continuity \nmeasures but not the specifics of how each business unit should fulfill \nthis requirement. \nThe majority of the company\u2019s product infrastructure is supported by \ncloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud, which perform regular \nbackups, snapshots of environment images, and multi-region hosting to \nensure compliance. In physical environments, we use more traditional \nmethods such as tape backups and offsite storage. Ziff Davis verifies \ncompliance with the Information Security Policy through regular reviews by \nCAS and our Information Security team.\nGOVERNANCE", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZD_2022.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
