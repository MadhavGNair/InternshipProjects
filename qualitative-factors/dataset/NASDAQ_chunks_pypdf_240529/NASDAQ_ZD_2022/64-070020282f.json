Excludes countries with less than $1 million in overall supplier spend. 2022 data \nincludes all supplier spend while prior year data only included tech spend, which is a majority of our overall \nsupply chain spend. Data for India was added in 2022 and prior year data is not available.\n13 In 2022, Ziff Davis developed a more robust calculation methodology that means the new figure is not \ncomparable to prior year data. For that reason the prior year data has not been included. The new, more robust \nmethod will be used going forward. Data storage figures exclude encrypted customer data that the company is \nnot able to access.
