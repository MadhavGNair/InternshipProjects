That path has led to a diverse workforce \nof professionals with divergent backgrounds that vary \nin age, geographies, ethnicity, cultural influences, \nand technological specializations. Accordingly, one \nof Alithya\u2019s most important keys to success has been \nits ability to harness that diversity to field a cohesive \nworkforce that collectively embraces its singular \nvision. In 2015, Alithya\u2019s workforce totalled 1,000 \nprofessionals and, by August 2022, the Company \nemployed more than 3,900, representing a 290% \nincrease. As a by-product of such rapid growth, there \nare inevitably challenges to overcome in terms of \norganizational culture.OUR APPROACH\nSince its founding 30 years ago, in 1992, Alithya\u2019s \nculture has been predicated on core values of \ntrust, respect, integrity, creativity, and passion, with \naccountability driven by the empowerment of those \nwho carry those values forward in the day-to-day \noperations and interactions of the Company. While \nAlithya\u2019s operations focus on innovation, excellence, \nand the achievement of customer business \nobjectives, values play a critical role in both the \nday-to-day hiring process and in Alithya\u2019s strategic \napproach to acquisitions, ensuring that those brought \non board will make positive contributions to the \nCompany\u2019s structured culture.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALYA_2022.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
