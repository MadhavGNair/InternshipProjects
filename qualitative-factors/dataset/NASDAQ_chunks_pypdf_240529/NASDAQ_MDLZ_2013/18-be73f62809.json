{"page_content": "MONDEL\u0112Z INTERNATIONAL PROGRESS REPORT | 2013 19\nSUSTAINABILITY\nreduced \nwasteELIMINATING WASTE\nThrough innovative solutions, production changes \nand employee training programs, we are reducing \nthe amount of net waste produced at our sites. \nBecause more than 99 percent of the waste we \ngenerate is from our factories, we focus our waste \nreduction efforts there. Overall, today we recycle \nor reuse about 90 percent of manufacturing waste \nand we have reduced net waste by 46 percent per \ntonne from 2010 to 2013, far in excess of our 15 \npercent goal. In our bakeries and manufacturing \nfacilities worldwide, common scraps are sorted so \nthat they can be recycled and reused. Materials \nthat are not recyclable or reusable are harvested \nand transformed into energy. Today, 50 of our \nfacilities send Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWTL) and, \nas of 2013, 31 percent of our production was from \nZWTL sites. \nCutting Waste Around the Globe \nOur plant in Herentals, Belgium, installed two waste andons (status-display stations) on each \nproduction line \u2014 one for production waste bins and one for packaging waste bins. In 2013, \nthe plant surpassed its 20 percent goal, achieving an actual reduction of 52 percent in net \nwaste per tonne of production compared to 2012.\nIndividual plants have been successful in cutting waste \u2014 by 40 percent in Cikarang and \nKarawang, Indonesia; 35% at Claremont, Australia; and 90% at Saint Petersburg, Russia. Our \nZero Waste to Landfill sites include Fallingbostel, Germany, and the Chicago and Naperville \nbakeries in the US.\n31% of our products are made at \nfacilities that sent Zero Waste to \nLandfill during 2013.\nReduced net \nwaste by \n46%, 3X \ngoalexceeded \ngoal", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2013.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
