{"page_content": "MONDEL\u0112Z INTERNATIONAL PROGRESS REPORT | 2013 31\nRESTORING WELL-BEING AFTER DISASTER\nWe have a long history of helping communities \nacross the globe in times of disaster by providing \nboth financial and in-kind support. In 2013, \nthe our Mondel\u0113z International Foundation \npledged $2 million USD to the American Red \nCross and the International Federation of the Red \nCross and Red Crescent Societies in support of \nhumanitarian aid. This two-year contribution helps \nboth organizations have resources immediately \navailable when disaster strikes to more quickly \ndeliver food, water, shelter and other critical \nresources to people impacted by disasters across \nthe world. COMMUNITIES\nBeing There When it Counts\nCatastrophic is the only way to describe Typhoon Haiyan that swept across the central \nPhilippines affecting millions \u2014 including our employees, customers, supplier, retail \nand other business partners. We did our part to support the response effort by \nproviding financial assistance and ready-to-eat snacks. In addition \u2014 and perhaps most \ninspiring \u2014 local employees stepped up to answer the call by volunteering their time to \nassemble relief kits for those in need. \n\u201c As the world\u2019s largest volunteer-based \nhumanitarian network, we are committed \nto meeting the needs and improving the \nlives of vulnerable people around the \nworld. We are grateful for the generosity \nof the Mondel\u0113z International Foundation \nand look forward to how their support \nwill help us respond to disasters and \nhealth emergencies across the globe.\u201d\n\u2014Walter Cotte, Under Secretary General, \nProgramme Services, International Federation of \nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies \nPhoto Credit: Patrick Fuller, IFRC", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2013.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
