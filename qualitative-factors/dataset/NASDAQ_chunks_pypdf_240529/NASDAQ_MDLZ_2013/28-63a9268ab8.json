It was with this in mind that we \u2014 \nthrough the Mondel\u0113z International Foundation \n\u2014 brought together for the first time seven of the \nworld\u2019s leading non-governmental organizations \n(NGOs) to address how we can impact the \neffectiveness of community-based obesity \nprevention programs and better measure impact. \nThe Healthy Lifestyles Summit leveraged Program \nImpact Pathways, a cutting-edge, comprehensive \nand rigorous evaluation approach. What emerged \nwas a common set of global metrics that all our community partners will use to measure \nimprovements in nutrition knowledge and to track \nsteps children and families are taking to get active \nand eat healthier. \nWe\u2019re hopeful others will join us on this journey, \nso we\u2019re committed to sharing our successes \nand opportunities along the way. To that end, \nsummary findings from the workshop will be \npublished in the September 2014 edition of the \nFood & Nutrition Bulletin , a leading resource for \nresearchers, academics and nutrition policy makers \nin 125-plus countries.Healthy Lifestyles  \nGlobal Summit\nAt the Mondel\u0113z International Foundation \nNGO summit, organizations from across \nthe world stretched their imaginations \non what could be done to improve health \noutcomes and drive behavior change in the \ncommunity.
