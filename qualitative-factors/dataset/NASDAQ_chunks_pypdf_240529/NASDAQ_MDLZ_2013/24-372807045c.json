{"page_content": "MONDEL\u0112Z INTERNATIONAL PROGRESS REPORT | 2013 25\nEmpowering Through Information\nPeople need information delivered clearly and \nsimply to help them make mindful snack choices for \nthemselves and their families. We are committed \nto ensuring our marketing and communication \npolicies are designed with this in mind. \nNUTRITION LABELING\nExcept for single ingredient products, like coffee, \nwe provide nutrition labeling  on all of our \nproducts, listing amounts for key nutrients, as \nwell as calories. Our labels will display the amount \nof each nutrient on packages either in a given \nportion and/or 100 grams, depending upon local \nregulations. We also work with other companies \nand organizations to deliver nutrition information \non front of pack; and by the end of 2016, we are \ncommitted to have calorie front-of-pack labeling \nglobally on all relevant products.ADVERTISING TO CHILDREN\nWe also support the parents\u2018 role in monitoring \nand choosing products that are right for their \nchildren. Since 2005, we have had a global policy  \nto not advertise our products to children under the \nage of six; for children between ages 6 and 11, we \nonly advertise those products that meet specific \nnutrition criteria .* We also prohibit advertising in \nboth primary and secondary schools. \nOur marketing-to-children policy is defined as any \nadvertising primarily directed to children between \nthe ages of 6 and 11; and where 35% or more \nof the viewing audience is under the age of 12. \nOur policy and approach applies to child-directed \nadvertising in TV, print, radio, Internet (both our \nown brand websites and third-party websites), \nadver-gaming, mobile, video and in cinema. \nWe also have food marketing standards that \nprovide additional guidance and are in line with \nthe International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) \nCode of Advertising and Marketing Communication \nPractice  and the ICC Framework for Responsible \nFood and Beverage Communications . MINDFUL SNACKING\nMonitoring Our \nAdvertising Commitment\nAs a founding member of the  International \nFood & Beverage Alliance (IFBA) , we \u2014 \nalong with the other members \u2014 made a \nglobal commitment to the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) to only advertise \nproducts that meet specific nutrition criteria \nto children under age 12 and to monitor  \nour efforts. \nTo monitor and report  publicly on \nprogress against the pledge, IFBA engages \nAccenture, a third-party media auditor. \nIn 2013, Accenture\u2019s report was based on \na review covering seven countries: China \n(Shanghai region), Colombia, Malaysia, \nRussia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and \nThailand. Accenture also reviewed 50 print \npublications and 86 websites across five \ncountries: Brazil, China (Shanghai region), \nRussia, Singapore and South Africa. Our \nIFBA Pledge compliance rate in 2013 was \n97.3 percent for television for all timeslots, \nand 100 percent for print and online.In the U.S., we are implementing \nthe Grocery Manufacturers \nAssociation and Food Marketing \nInstitute\u2019s Facts Up Front  front-of-\npack labeling program, with the \ngoal to be completed by 2015.\n*Exception to this is in the US and EU, where we apply the uniform pledge nutrition criteria. In the US, it\u2019s the US \nCFBAI criteria , and in the EU we follow the EU pledge criteria .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2013.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
