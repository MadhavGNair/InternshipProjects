{"page_content": "MONDEL\u0112Z INTERNATIONAL PROGRESS REPORT | 2013 20\nSUSTAINABILITY\nREDUCING GHG EMISSIONS & SAVING ENERGY\nWe\u2019ve made strides by reducing energy-related \ngreenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing \nby 9 percent and manufacturing-site energy \nuse by 6 percent since 2010. We\u2019re investing \nin projects to save energy and use renewable \nsources, like creating biogas from effluent at \nour Banbury, UK plant, and burning rice husks \nand coconut shells as a renewable energy source \nat Sucat, Philippines. We have developed an integrated energy \nmanagement system aimed at reducing our total \nenergy consumption and are installing heat \nrecovery systems in specific areas of our biscuit \nbakery networks.\nAdditionally, a number of our facilities have \nbeen recognized with Leadership in Energy \nand Environmental Design (LEED) certifications, \nincluding Recife and Orbigo in Brazil, and \nFallingbostel, Germany.\nEmissions and Energy \nChanges in Our Factories\nOur Milka  chocolate factory in \nLorrach, Germany reduced its steam \ndemand significantly in 2013. By \neliminating five boilers and using heat \npumps and heat recovery from several \nutilities, Lorrach reduced its energy \nuse by 19 percent in 2013 compared \nto 2012, despite a significant increase \nin production volume.\nOur factory in Ikeja, Nigeria installed \na new vapor absorption chiller that \nuses waste heat from an onsite power \ngenerator, rather than requiring its \nown boiler. The initiative, installed in \nOctober 2013, is reducing the site\u2019s \nenergy use per tonne of production \nby 10 percent.9%*\n6%*of emissions per tonne reduced \nthrough energy saving projects and \nrenewable energy sources\nreduced energy per tonne at our \nmanufacturing sites worldwide \nand continue to evaluate how we \ncan improve upon this goal*graph reflects goal of 15%\n*graph reflects goal of 15%greenhouse \ngases\nreduced \nenergy", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2013.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
