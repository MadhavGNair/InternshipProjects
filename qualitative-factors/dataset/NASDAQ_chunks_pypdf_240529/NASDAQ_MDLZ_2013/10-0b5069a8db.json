{"page_content": "MONDEL\u0112Z INTERNATIONAL PROGRESS REPORT | 2013 11\nSUSTAINABILITY\nCocoa Life : Verifying Our Impact  \nOur focus is on having a positive impact on \nfarmers\u2019 productivity and income. To track, \nevaluate and report Cocoa Life  progress, \nwe have published 10 global, high-level key \nperformance indicators (KPIs) to measure the \nimpact of the program\u2019s five core themes: farming, \ncommunity, livelihoods, youth, and environment.\nOur progress will be verified through a process \nconsisting of three key steps:\n1. Annual, independent evaluation in Cocoa \nLife  communities at origin: Led by Harvard \nUniversity research team, the evaluation will \nmeasure and report on the 10 KPIs. \n2. Holistic analysis every three years: Using \ndata collected annually on the ground, the \nHarvard research team will conduct a holistic \nstudy of Cocoa Life  to ensure it is on track \nto achieve its vision of empowered, thriving \ncocoa communities, including comparison with \ncontrol communities outside the program. The \nfirst holistic analysis run by Harvard University \nis underway. It focuses on Ghana, where the \nprogram first started in 2008, and is due to be \npublished later in 2014.\n3. Supply chain alignment verification: As the \nprogram scales up, a third-party monitor will \nverify the flow of cocoa from Cocoa Life  \ncommunities into our supply chain. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2013.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
