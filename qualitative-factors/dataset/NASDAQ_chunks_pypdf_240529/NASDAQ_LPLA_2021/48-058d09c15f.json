Total natural gas does not include Boston office (LPL \noccupies a portion of space within the building)\n2.  Fort Mill\u2019s Scope 1 emissions were calculated using natural gas.\n3.  San Diego\u2019s Scope 1 emissions were calculated using \nnatural gas data and one month of fuel oil\n4.  Scope 1 emission streams include consumption of natural \ngas, fuel oil, and district cooling, and excluded refrigerants5.  Scope 2 emissions calculated using WRI GHG Protocol\u2019s \nLocation-based Method\n6.  In our 2019 report, we overreported our Scope 1 GHG \nemissions at our Fort Mill location. These numbers have \nbeen updated to reflect the correct figures\n7.  Electricity utilized at our five data center locations is \nbased off of energy usage reports that varied in format and \naccuracy, contracted power (when actual usage was not \navailable), and an assumed power usage effectiveness ratio \n(PUE) of 1.8 when PUE was not otherwise available8.  Our data centers are almost entirely powered by grid \nelectricity (Scope 2 emissions), but do leverage Scope 1 \nsources for backup generation. Those figures were not \ncalculated in this year\u2019s report\n9.  Data centers excluded. As energy use and emissions  \nfrom our data centers were not measured in 2019, the % \nchange here is calculated by using 2020 figures to provide  \na reasonable comparison\n49\nLPL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LPLA_2021.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
