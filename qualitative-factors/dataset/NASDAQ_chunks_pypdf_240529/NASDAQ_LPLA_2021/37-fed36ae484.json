In 2020, the LPL Foundation made contributions \nto organizations supporting COVID-19 relief efforts and focused its corporate giving \nprogram on helping individuals impacted by COVID-19. Schooling changed from in-\nperson to remote overnight once the scale of the virus was realized, creating nationwide \nchallenges related to overcoming digital divides, literacy, and even hunger. Our \ncontributions supported organizations seeking to help manage and solve these issues. \nFor more information on our COVID-19 response, see page 12 .  \nHistorically Black colleges and Universities partnership  \nwith Johnson C. Smith University\nOne of our leading charitable giving programs is our HBCU partnership with Johnson C. \nSmith University (JCSU). The LPL Foundation provides support for Phasing Up, which \nfocuses on providing financial support for JCSU students who have aged out of the foster \ncare system, funding housing expenses and covering transportation costs for qualified \nstudents who are otherwise unable to afford housing expenses and visits home during \nschool breaks. Additionally, we expanded the impact of our grant by partnering with JCSU \nto dedicate some of the funding to their Career Services program, which is available to all \nJCSU students. Our employees volunteer virtually and in person with JCSU through career \nfairs, career experience panels, and resume writing and job application events.\nSupporting Austin community impacted by winter storm\nIn early 2021, the LPL Financial Foundation responded swiftly to the devastating winter \nstorms that impacted communities in Austin, Texas.
