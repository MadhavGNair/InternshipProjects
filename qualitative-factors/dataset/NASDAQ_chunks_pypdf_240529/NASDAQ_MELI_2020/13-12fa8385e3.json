Digital \ntransformation has become a key factor \nin getting through the crisis, supporting \ncollaborators and moving forward with a \nsustainable growth plan in the medium \nand long term. In this context, the \necosystem of Mercado Libre solutions \npositions itself as an essential ally to \nSMEs, who have found a partner to \nmaintain their source of income in \ntough times through e-commerce and \ndigital payments.  \n \nIn 2020, we capitalized technology \nto generate new ideas and solutions, \nwhich drive commerce and multiply \nopportunities and quality jobs. The \npandemic and the preventive social \nisolation accelerated the technological \nreconversion of SMEs and the cultural \nchange of users in connection with \nInternet shopping. According to a study in \n2020, it is estimated that in Argentina and \nMexico, seven out of ten sales are online.  On the other hand, in Brazil, in a market \nanalysis carried out with Locomotiva, 46% \nof sellers queried said they make all of \ntheir sales on the Internet.\nToday, more than 11.6 million \nentrepreneurs and companies in the \nregion sell their products and services \nthrough Mercado Libre. During the year,  more than 4.9 million new SMEs and \nentrepreneurs joined. These data \nencourage us to keep working, because \nthey show us that we are the economic \npillar of many Latin American families and \na great engine for the region's recovery. \nFrom Mercado Pago, we contribute \nto socio-economic development on \nthree levels: by supporting the financial \ninclusion of entrepreneurs and vulnerable \nsectors, putting technology at the service \nof the positive-social-impact generation \nand multiplying NGO fundraising.
