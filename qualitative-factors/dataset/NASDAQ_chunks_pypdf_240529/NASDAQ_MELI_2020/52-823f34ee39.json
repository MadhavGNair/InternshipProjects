We are planning several transitional and \u201cnew normal\u201d scenarios \nin our characteristic style. That is to say, we designed innovative measures, making \nvisionary decisions, setting trends and prioritizing the health and wellbeing of \nthe employees.\nDuring the last months of the year, we began a transition which considered the situation \nin each country in particular, creating a gradual return plan in each case. \nOur offices in Uruguay were the first to return to work in-house. This return model was \ncarried out gradually, segmenting teams on a staggered scale on a three-week rotation. \nPeople worked in-house one week and then two weeks remotely. All the stages were \ndesigned, coordinated and communicated in detail, focusing on keeping the teams \ninformed, protected and controlled at all times. The first group returned to the offices on \nthe July 20; the second, on July 27 and the third on August 3. We are enormously proud \nto say that the experience was totally successful.\nRetorno a las oficinas UY\u22b2 OUR TEAM\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2020.pdf", "page": 52, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
