These systems protect, alert \nand allow traceability when these types \nof events occur.\nThe area is made up of different verticals \nwithin each business unit, which provide \neach other with feedback to achieve a \ndeeper and more complete vision. \nFurthermore, it offers services to the \nentire organization in terms of access \nassurance, prevention and detection of \nmalicious software, as well as security \nmanagement of the entire infrastructure \nthat supports Mercado Libre\u2019s ecosystem.\nManagement focuses on ensuring \nIT security according to Zero \nTrust principles: automation and \ndecentralization, automatic response \nand behavior analysis. This approach \nseeks to avoid any type of information \nleak, as well as preventing and detecting \npotential attacks. The IT Security staff \ndefines its annual strategy, redefined \nquarterly, based on the approach of \nthe United States National Institute \nof Standards and Technology (NIST) \ncybersecurity framework.We measure our management based on \nkey performance indicators (KPI) which \nare unified in risk management. This \nprovides us with a general vision, to carry \nout an iterative strategy for continuous \nimprovement strategy, guaranteeing \nthe excellence of our work. At the same \ntime, each of the area's central goals has \ninternal assessment metrics, which are \nanalyzed continuously, not only at the \nmanagement level but also technically, \nto take corrective actions as soon as \npossible. The teams assess their goals \nquarterly. Such assessment is presented \nannually to the Audit Area.  \nWe also have a Third-Party Risk \nManagement process, which allows us \nto assess our critical suppliers in terms of \nsecurity, identifying risks and informing the \nareas involved, to guarantee data security.\u22b2 USER ORIENTED\nOur cybersecurity risk \nmanagement program allows us \nto identify, analyze and monitor \naction plans to minimize exposure.  \nThe method focuses on threats \nand vulnerabilities associated \nwith the processes and controls \nunder the management of the IT \nSecurity Department and involve \ntackling information security based \non three pillars: confidentiality, \nintegrity and availability.\nThis risk management process \nresponds to NIST 800-30 \nmethodology (Risk Management \nGuidelines for Information \nTechnology Systems).", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2020.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
