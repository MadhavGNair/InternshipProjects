Therefore, we \nquestion our habits and decisions from \nthe moment we purchase supplies until \nthe leftover materials are disposed of, \nwith the commitment to reduce, reuse \nand recycle the waste we generate.\nLoyal to our continuous beta \nmode, we are constantly \nlooking for new technologies \nand sustainable innovations \nregarding packaging to mitigate \nthe impact and to manage \nresources more efficiently. \nThe management focuses on traceability, \nthe search of alternative materials and \nreduction. All our packaging is recyclable, \nreusable or compostable. 100% of the \ncardboard we use is traceable in its \ncertified value chain or in the process of \ncertification with the Forest Stewardship \nCouncil (FSC) seal. This label guarantees that the product \nwas manufactured under processes \nthat involve responsible forest use. \nAdditionally, this year we reached the \ngoal that all the boxes used in our \noperations are composed of at least \n40% recycled cardboard.\nAlways looking for alternative \nmaterials, in 2020 we continued pilot \ntesting of compostable envelopes for \ne-commerce in Brazil and Argentina. \nAlso, this year, in compliance with the \nnew regulation in Chile, the project \nwas successfully implemented in this \ncountry, where 100% of the envelopes \nare made of internationally certified \nbioplastics, suitable for domestic and \nindustrial compost. \nTo permanently reduce the amount \nof packaging, in 2020 we tested the \npossibility that some products can be \ntransported in their original packages \nwithout any additional materials, \nreducing their use and the amount of air \ntransport in the last mile. In Argentina, \npilot programs achieved up to a 40% \nreduction in transported air. In line with this goal, we work closely \nwith our packaging suppliers to reduce \npackage weight in order to reduce the \nquantity of material used in each delivery, \nwithout compromising product integrity.Materials management\n100%\nof our packaging is recyclable,\nreusable or compostable\u22b2 ENVIRONMENT\nORIGIN OF GENERATED WASTE (in tons)\n \nAluminum\nCardboard\nPaper\nPlastic\nWood\nOrganic/\ncompostable\nGeneral\nTotalARG\n0.3\n596.95\n \n0.5\n26.7 \n \n123.5\n \n0\n \n284.9\n \n1032.7MEX\n0.2\n1539.4\n10.7 \n96.5\n336.3\n28\n532 \n2543URU\n0.1 \n0.7 \n0.2\n \n0,7\n \n0\n \n6.8\n \n5.1\n \n13.5CHI\n0.1\n67.2 \n0.1 \n \n2.0\n \n1.1\n \n0.3\n17.7 \n \n88.4COL\n0.1\n37.5 \n \n0.1\n \n2.9\n \n0.5\n \n0.8\n \n7.1\n48.9 BRA\n1.7 \n3834\n21.8\n \n373\n1399.9\n \n142.5\n429.1 \n \n6202", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2020.pdf", "page": 73, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
