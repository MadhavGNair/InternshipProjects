We do this in \npartnership with the Entrop\u00eda program from the regional Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica \nNacional (UTN), Buenos Aires.\nThrough a dynamic approach, Entrop\u00eda incentivizes the cognitive skills of young people \nwho must overcome barriers to accessing exact science content. Since it started, the \nprogram has doubled the percentage of university admissions. \nMercado Libre contributed with 400 scholarships, providing mobility and materials, and \nalso facilitating systematic assistance all through the third year of the degree course.\nAt the same time, we promoted Modelando la Ciencia, also with the Universidad \nTecnol\u00f3gica Nacional. It is a pedagogical partnership for public school STEM teachers, \nthrough an advanced training course in Math, Physics and Technology strategies, \nmethodologies and resources.We support the formation\nin STEM with UTN-Entrop\u00eda\nArgentina\u22b2 SOCIAL IMPACT\nWe promote talent inclusion and equal opportunities in IT, expanding \naccess to technological education, especially focused on women.
