{"page_content": "\u2014 24\n2020 IMPACT REPORTMateriality \nanalysis \nEvery year, we perform a \nmateriality exercise to learn the \nstakeholders' view of the most \nrelevant topics for sustainability \nmanagement, as well as those topics \nabout which they want more information. \nThe exercise is conducted based on the \nrecommendations of Global Reporting \nInitiative standards, taking as a basis \nthe definition of materiality established \nby the Sustainability Accounting \nStandards Board (SASB) indicators for the \nE-Commerce industry.  \n \nIn 2020, we reviewed topics from the \nprevious period, and we decided to \nreplace the title \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d \nwith \u201cfinancial education and inclusion\u201d, \nin order to more precisely define the \nmanagement scope of this topic. With \nthe same criterion, we also changed \nthe title \u201cEnvironmental Footprint\u201d to \n\u201cEnvironmental Footprint Reduction\u201d.Next, the topics were prioritized internally \nand validated with the stakeholders \nthrough an online survey that was \nanswered by 87,099 people, growing \n336% over the previous period. The \ndifference in the sizes of each sample \nwill not affect the general result. This was \nconsidered in the analysis. The survey contained open-ended \nquestions about key topics and concerns \nstakeholders think should be included, \nin addition to the topics the company \nprioritizes. Most of the answers could be \nframed in some of the material issues \nlisted, such as mitigating shipping \nemissions and packaging (Environmental Footprint Reduction), complaint \nmanagement and user claims (Buyer \nand Seller Behavior), withheld payments \nand security on purchases (User Trust \nand Security) and the recognition and \ntraining of employees (Attract Human \nCapital and Talent).\nArgentina\nMexico\nBrazil\nColombia\nUruguay\nChile\nVenezuela\nPeru\nOthers40,674\n19,123\n13,344\n4980\n4288\n3052\n28\n10\n160047%\n22%\n15%\n6%\n5%\n4%\n0%\n0%\n2%BY COUNTRYPlatform users\nEmployees\nNGOs\nThougts and\nopinion leaders\nSuppliers\nShareholders\nBussiness\nchambers\nGovernment\nOthers84,875\n2090\n45\n24\n15\n11\n10\n2\n2697%\n2%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%BY STAKEHOLDERS  \nGROUP\u22b2 SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY\n+87,000\nrepresentatives of our\nstakeholders participated in\nthe materiality analysis\n+336% vs 2019", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2020.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
