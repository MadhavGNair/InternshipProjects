{"page_content": "\u2014 54\n2020 IMPACT REPORTWe created the first multiple employment \nagreement in Latin America\nDuring the pandemic, several industrial \nareas were deeply affected by the need \nto stop and narrow their activities due \nto the preventive isolation measures. \nTo collaborate in their recovery, during \nthe emergency we designed and \nimplemented employment alliances with \naffected companies, such as Le Pain \nQuotidien, Arcos Dorados (operator \nof McDonald's) and Alsea (operator of \nStarbucks and Burger King).\n \nThanks to these innovative agreements, \nwe temporarily hired 350 people that \nwork for these companies, who joined \nthe Customer Service and Delivery teams \nin Argentina and Brazil. \nThis action was the first multiple \nemployment agreement design and \nimplementation experience in Latin \nAmerica, and it meant benefits for all \nthe parties involved. People kept their \njobs, receiving 100% of their salaries, \nexpanded their employability and lived \nthe experience of working for MELI. \nFor our company, the agreement helped \nto cover positions quickly, broadened our \nexperience in Diversity and Inclusion, and at the same time allowed us to be \npresent for this emergency situation in \nour community. On the other hand, the \nallied companies could save the money \nfor salaries which was difficult to deal \nwith in a context where their operations \nwere severely affected. Additionally, \nsubsidies and unemployment funds were \navoided. Finally, together we were able \nto strengthen the employer branding of \nall the companies involved. \n100\npeople from Le Pain Quotidien\n(Argentina)350\npeople were temporarily\nhired by MELI\n250\npeople from McDonald's, Burger King\nand Starbucks (Argentina and Brazil)\n\u22b2 OUR TEAM\nAlianzas de Empleo | Historias MELI\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2020.pdf", "page": 53, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
