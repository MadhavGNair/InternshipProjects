Therefore, \ndemocratizing financial \nservices ensures that everybody, \nregardless of their origin or economic \nstatus, can obtain accessible and safe \nproducts and services, taking control of \ntheir financial lives.\nIn Latin America, barely 50% of the \npopulation has a bank account. As \nleaders in the fintech industry in the \nregion, our main objective is to boost \nthe financial inclusion of a greater \nnumber of people in the countries in \nwhich we operate, through the use of \nvirtual accounts and electronic payment \nmethods, which allow them not only to \ndigitalize their transfers but to access \nsavings and loan instruments. This also \nallows people to stabilize or increase \ntheir incomes and to be more resilient \nto the ups and downs of the economy, \nimproving their quality of life. \u22b2 ABOUT MERCADO LIBRE\n$Knowledge is the key tool that allows \npeople to benefit from their finances. \nTherefore, we work in articulation with \norganizations focused on entrepreneur \ntraining and education.\nAware of our responsibility to \npromote financial education \nactions that support our users, \nwe created a multidisciplinary \ncommittee in Brazil.  \nWe developed actions with organizations \nthat work with microentrepreneurs, \ndesigned educational content on the \nuse of Mercado Pago and its products, \nimplemented programs on the conscious \nuse of financial services and trained \nsmall companies in entrepreneurship and \nfinancial management:\n- We launched Blog Conexi\u00f3n Mercado   \n  Pago , a special content site for our   \n  users, especially entrepreneurs.\n \n- We continue to reach \n  microentrepreneurs through content \n  hosted on the Tamo Junto platform from \n  the Alianza Emprendedora NGO.- We joined with accounting applications \n  to facilitate the formalization of small \n  businesses and increase their capacity \n  to have an impact.\n- We promoted live events and \n  audiovisual content to support \n  entrepreneurs and help them reinvent \n  themselves and digitalize during the \n  pandemic.\n- We developed content with No \n  Front, a group of people that works \n  on financial inclusion of vulnerable \n  communities using rap music as their \n  best ally. To do that, we implemented \n  a series of live music events and slam   \n  championships that link music with \n  financial inclusion content. \n - We created Caf\u00e9 com Pix, a series of \n  live content for social networks seeking \n  to educate sellers and users of our \n  platforms on the use of Pix, the new \n  instant payment system in Brazil. \n  Experts from Banco Central do Brasil \n  (BCB), the Brazilian Support Service to \n  micro and small businesses (SEBRAE), \n  participated, among others.Financial education\n \nAccess to financial \nsolutions is a key \ninstrument in fighting \npoverty, fostering \nformality and generating \neconomic and social \ndevelopment.
