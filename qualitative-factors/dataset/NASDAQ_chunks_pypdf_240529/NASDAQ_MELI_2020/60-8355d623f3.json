Since its creation, \nmore than 1000 entrepreneurs have \nparticipated, who also nourish our \nSustainable Products section.\nIn 2020, we held the second edition, \nthis time 100% online, in which projects \nfrom Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, Chile, \nColombia, and Brazil participated. The \nprogram included open master classes, \nonline classes, group mentoring and \nvirtual meetings with experts from each \ncountry.\nThe content is imparted by model \nsustainable entrepreneurs with \nexperience in business, marketing and \ncommunication plan development, \nwith positive impact and economic \nsustainability.We ran the program with Mayma, an \nArgentine organization whose purpose is \nto create a more humane and conscious \neconomy through training, connection \nand visibility of entrepreneurs from \nLatin America; and with Giral, a Brazilian \norganization which supports the creation \nof ideas, projects and businesses with \nthe development goal of a human-life \nbalance on the planet. In addition, in \norder to continue strengthening the \nBrazilian impact ecosystem, we joined \nAceleradora Semante de Neg\u00f3cio and \nFondo Editodos.\nFinally, the three most outstanding \nentrepreneurs were selected and \nawarded with USD 20,000, USD \n10,000 and USD 5000 in seed money \neach. First and second place were \nchosen by a regional jury of experts in \nentrepreneurship and impact. The third \nplace was chosen by public vote on the \nprogram's microsite.\nWithin the framework of Entrepreneurship \nwith Impact, together with Instituto de \nla Ciudadan\u00eda Empresaria (ICE) in Brazil, \nwe co-created the Commercial Strategy \nGuide for Impact Businesses.
