Since \n2019, Mercado Libre has been offering \nthe permanent Sustainable Products \nsection. It is available in seven countries \nin the region. It promotes our work \ntoward digital inclusion and sustainable \nconsumption. Throughout the year, we \nbolstered this space with campaigns \npromoting new forms of consumption, \nsuch as EcoFriday, Semana del Medio \nAmbiente (Environment Week), and \n\u201cAmaz\u00f4nia en Casa and Bosque en Pi\u00e9\u201d.\n \nIn order to incorporate more \nentrepreneurs into the section, we \nstrengthened our alliance with Sistema \nB Latin America, adding benefits for B \nCorporations. We also trained more than \n150 B entrepreneurs throughout the \nregion and gave them financing plans \nand shipping to boost their sales.Positive-impact\nconsumptionThe growth of positive-impact \nconsumption in the COVID-19 context\nThe Sustainable Products section is \nalso a space to analyze positive-impact \nconsumption levels in the region. \nIn 2020, we conducted a study to \nunderstand the behavior of sustainable \nconsumption during the pandemic. As a \nresult, we discovered that during 2020, \nmore than 2.5 million users bought \nproducts with social and environmental \nimpact in Latin America. The products \nwith the greatest growth were those \nrelated to compost and personal care.\nRead the report\n+30,000\nproducts listed6\ncountries have a\nSustainable Products section\n+6000\nentrepreneurs\n+145%\nsustainable sellers\n+104%\nsustainable products+3400\nvisitors each day", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2020.pdf", "page": 58, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
