From the \nvery beginning, we wanted to anticipate \nthe situation and respond to the context, \nusing the ability of our teams to put all \nMELIs principles into practice very rapidly \nand nimbly. \n \nWhen the first cases of COVID-19 \nappeared in the region, Mercado Libre \nwas the first one to act and took the \nnecessary precautions to look after \npeople's health and security, using \nits transformational capital to care for \ncollaborators, in order to guarantee \nthe continued operation and avoiding \npropagation of the virus.In only 24 hours, 90% of people \nat Mercado Libre started \nworking remotely. And the \n10% considered essential staff \ncontinued working in-house \nwith all the security standards, \nto guarantee the continuity \nof the excellent operations as \nusual, throughout the region.\nIn this path, we discovered new and \nbetter ways to offer experiences, \naccelerating scalability and the network \nconnection. An intense exercise that \nprovides evolved actions and inspires us \nto keep exploring, beyond the context of \nthe pandemic.How did we support our teams?\n#Centering\n#Yoga\nlive streaming\nWeekly tips\nCOVID-19 BOT\nTR Best Practices\nWorkplace Group\nLEADERS COLLABORATORSGuide for Leaders\nHealthy diet#DNA Rituals Social Interaction\n#Press COVID-19\nPsychological\nassistance\nEAP LineManaging my emotions\nin quarantine\u22b2 OUR TEAM", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2020.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
