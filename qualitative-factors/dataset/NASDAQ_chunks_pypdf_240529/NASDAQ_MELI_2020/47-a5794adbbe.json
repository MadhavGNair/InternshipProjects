In order to \ncontinue evolving our value proposal \nand broaden it each year, we strengthen \nour ecosystem of technological solutions \nwith innovative tools, integrated and \nspecially designed to provide unique and \nmemorable experiences. \n \nOur teams stand out for their high \nlevel of efficiency, diversity and total \ncommitment, associated with goals that \nmust be measured efficiently. That is why \nwe have a combination of technological \nsolutions that enable us to analyze, \nmonitor and predict behaviors in critical \nvariables such as recruitment plan \ninstances, level of commitment, and level \nof turnover of duties, among others.  \nThis ecosystem of technological solutions \nis comprised of Workplace by Facebook, \nSuccessFactors and several BOTs (robot \napheresis) or virtual assistants, among \nother tools, and these help us multiply \nand elevate the MELI Experience.\nAt Mercado Libre, we do not send \nmass e-mails. People are connected, \ninformed and take part proactively. With \nWorkplace, collaborators can connect \nwith and access their content from any \ndevice, share groups, and stay up to date \nwith the main news and launches. \nIn addition, we increased live \ntransmissions in which the different \nleaders discuss the most relevant \nprojects, connecting valuable \nconversations. For instance, more than \n200 people took part in the new format \nof visits from the CEO via Workplace, \nwhich obtained 91% favorability. BOTs or virtual assistants allows us to \ntransform and scale through a network. \nWe especially design them with \nfunctional adaptations to different types \nof assistance that allows us to answer \nquestions, inform users or assign tasks.\n \nIn 2020, we launched Library, our \nresource library, with instructions to \nimprove the experience of access to \nvalue information. We also presented a \ncycle of #DecisionMaking podcasts and \nvideos, which were in charge of leaders. 14,409\nactive monthly users15,834\nactive Workplace accounts\n+500\n active monthly groups\u22b2 OUR TEAM", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2020.pdf", "page": 47, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
