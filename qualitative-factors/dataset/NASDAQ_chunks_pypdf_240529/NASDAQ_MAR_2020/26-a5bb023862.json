Marriott\u2019s success begins with our commitment to help provide a world of opportunity.\nOur Commitment: Our formal, company-wide diversity, equity, and inclusion program has \nbeen in place for over 30 years, with a range of programs, partnerships, initiatives, and accountability to ensure all \u2013 associates, guests, owners, and suppliers \u2013 feel welcome. We were also one of the first companies in any industry, nearly two decades ago, to establish a Board of Directors-led Committee for Excellence (recently renamed Inclusion and Social \nImpact Committee) focused on advancing inclusive opportunities, with accountability metrics \nat the highest levels.\nAs our company faces one of the most incredible hardships and business challenges due \nto COVID-19, we are facing another crisis and recognize that taking a stand against racial injustice must also be a top priority. While we have a long history as a diversity champion, we know there is more we can \u2013 and must \u2013 accomplish to contribute to a society where \neveryone experiences equity, justice, and inclusion.  \nThe Conversation Starts With Us: CEO Arne Sorenson and senior leaders kicked off a series \nof global town halls \u2013 TakeCare Community Talks \u2013 attended by thousands of associates to openly share associate feedback and senior leader perspectives on our fight against racism, advancement of equality and justice in society, and Marriott\u2019s role in those efforts.Workforce Engagement: Living Our Core Values (LOCV), our annual signature engagement program, is facilitated by General Managers with all associates at our managed properties. LOCV energizes and engages associates while giving them an opportunity to share their ideas, insights, and experiences. Our 2019-2020 LOCV installment \u2013 Respect for All \u2013 included discussions around understanding conscious and unconscious biases to help associates \nrecognize how their unique view of the world could result in unconscious biases and what they \ncan do to ensure they are providing the same warm welcome and level of service to all. \nOn-Ramps to Leadership: Our Emerging Leadership Program (ELP) was created to ensure \nthe development of our bench strength talent \u2013 high-performing front-line leaders, senior leaders, and other managers who have demonstrated the ability to excel to higher levels of responsibility. Since its inception, ELP has been instrumental in building and increasing \nthe number of people of color and women in leadership roles. Over 1,600 have completed \nthe program and nearly 100% have been promoted or selected for strategic developmental management and P&L roles since joining the program.\nWe are expanding this program to bring an even sharper focus on the career development \nneeds of our diverse leadership pipeline while creating exciting new pathways for the next generation to begin their careers with us.\nWorking With Our Partners: Marriott is an active and engaged corporate member of \nglobal nongovernmental organizations across many different diverse segments that support the development of opportunities for our key stakeholders including diverse and historically underrepresented suppliers, current and potential associates, hotel owners, and customers.
