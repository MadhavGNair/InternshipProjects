This critical step was vital prior to communicating Marriott\u2019s expectations to the suppliers of those categories and working with them to achieve our responsible sourcing goals. We also launched our updated Global Procurement Supplier Conduct Guidelines, which outline our commitment to responsible business practices and operations, including engaging with vendors and suppliers that are dedicated to similar principles.
