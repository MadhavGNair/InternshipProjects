We also removed compensation inquiries from the U.S. employment application process and stopped considering salary history when establishing starting pay for new associates in the U.S. and Canada.\nActive Involvement: Marriott also holds membership in numerous organizations to promote \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion.

We remain committed to upholding and respecting human rights through our human trafficking awareness and prevention initiatives and collaboration with key partners. Since 2017, human trafficking awareness training has been a requirement for all on-property associates across both managed and franchised properties. Marriott\u2019s comprehensive training addresses human trafficking, child exploitation, and forced labor. The \u201cYour Role in Preventing Human Trafficking: Know the Signs\u201d training is available in 17 languages. The purpose of the training is to raise awareness of all forms of human trafficking and educate associates on the indicators and what they can do should they suspect potential issues. \n2025 Sustainability andSocial Impact Goals\nGlobal Procurement Supplier\nConduct Guidelines\nHuman Rights Policy StatementUK Human Trafficking\nTransparency Statement\nWelcome All and Advance Human Rights\n(\u201cHuman Rights \u201d)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2020.pdf", "page": 66, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
