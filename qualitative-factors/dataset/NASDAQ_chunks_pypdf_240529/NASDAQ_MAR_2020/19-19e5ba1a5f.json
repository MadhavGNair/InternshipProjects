We Serve Our World to make a positive and sustainable impact \nwherever we do business. \nIn 2019, Marriott launched our enhanced Sustainability Policy , in which we commit to \nresponsible and sustainable business practices that benefit the environment and the \ncommunities in which our hotels are located. Our signature Make a Green Choice program \ncontinued to expand across the portfolio in 2019, with a refresh that allows guests at \nparticipating properties the opportunity to receive points or contribute to a regionally-relevant sustainability project. For each night a guest participates and forgoes housekeeping, they help us to reduce the use of water, energy, and waste, joining our sustainability journey.\nSUSTAIN  \nRESPONSIBLE \nOPERATIONS\nImage: The Westin\u00ae Denarau Island Resort & Spa, Fiji sources produce for the property from the Denarau organic farm.\n2020 SERVE 360 REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2020.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
