So, \nworkplace equity is not just a value, but a core policy commitment, \none to which we hold leaders at every level accountable. We\u2019ve \nworked hard to foster a culture of inclusion, and empowered \nteam members to drive the conversation through impact-driven \nEmployee Resource Groups. \nLooking outward, we try to bring these same values to our presence \nin the marketplace. It\u2019s important to us that we be a trusted brand \nfor riders, drivers, business partners, potential hires, and the \ncommunities where we operate. We always want to interact with \nthe world in a way that communicates clearly the importance we \nplace on these priorities. \nThis year, in particular, we\u2019ve found ourselves confronting the \nquestion of what it means to be a successful, responsible company \nin a world where injustice is still far too prevalent. How can we \ntake these core values \u2014 inclusion, diversity, respect \u2014 and apply \nthem to the world outside our organization? \nTo help answer this question, we\u2019ve endeavored in 2021 to focus \nmore attention on our external efforts to promote racial equity. \nWe see ourselves as part of the communities we serve, and we feel \nwe cannot, and must not, shy away from being part of the solution \nto systemic racism. \nThese are our intentions, and we must measure ourselves by \nour impact. That\u2019s why, whether it\u2019s within our workplace or out \nin the community, accountability is always at the core of our \ncommitment. We continue to build accountability metrics to ensure \nwe are delivering on hiring, and making our I&D work not just a \ncore value, but a formal element of our business plan. \nFor more information on Lyft\u2019s strategy and progress, please refer \nto our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity, and Racial Equity Report.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LYFT_2021.pdf", "page": 94, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
