We partner with healthcare organizations \u2014 including health \nplans, health systems, and transportation managers \u2014 to reduce \ntransportation barriers to care and improve access to programs \nthat promote overall health. There are three issues we\u2019re trying \nto solve: improving pickup times and appointment adherence, \nincreasing patient satisfaction, and driving cost savings. We\u2019ve \nforged partnerships with leading healthcare organizations across \nthe country \u2014 including 9 of the top 10 health systems, 9 of the \ntop 10 non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) managers, \nand the top 10 health plans \u2014 to help patients access care. Results \nfrom early studies on Lyft usage for healthcare visits are extremely \npositive. A study with AmeriHealth Caritas DC showed a 40% \ndecrease in ER utilization when using Lyft, while our program with \nRoyal Care Connect resulted in a 73% decrease in no-shows for \nprimary care appointments.47\nWho uses Lyft in healthcare:\n9/10\ntop health systems9/10\ntop NEMT brokersTOP 10 \nhealth plans", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LYFT_2021.pdf", "page": 51, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
