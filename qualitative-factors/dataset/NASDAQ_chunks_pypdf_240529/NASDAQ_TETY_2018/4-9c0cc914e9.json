{"page_content": "Tethys Oil\u2019s \nbusiness model \nTethys Oil\u2019s business model is to be active in the onshore \nexploration, appraisal and production stages of the \nupstream oil and gas business cycle in geographies with \nproven hydrocarbon deposits, existing infrastructure and \nan established institutional framework. \nIn all its activities Tethys Oil seeks a balanced approach to \nrisk. The strategic decision to focus purely on onshore explo-\nration and production of oil is a function of this approach. \nOnshore oil exploration involves a lower financial exposure \ndue to lower drilling and development cost. It also involves \nlower environmental and safety risks compared to offshore \ndrilling, particularly in harsh environments. The strategic \ndecision to focus on geographies with proven hydrocarbons \nallows Tethys Oil to reduce subsurface risk by seeking to \nexplore in areas with previously overlooked discoveries and \nplays using modern techniques and with proven, conven-\ntional technology.\n55", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TETY_2018.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
