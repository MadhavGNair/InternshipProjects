Following \nthe GWC curriculum, 32 Southside students participated in \nprojects that involved using HTML, creating coding in Python \nand exploring cybersecurity and phishing techniques. Using \nScratch language, 11 Kimmons students focused on learning \nbasic coding concepts through a colorful drag-and-drop \ninterface. This is the third school year we\u2019ve partnered with \nFort Smith schools to lead Girls Who Code, and we plan to \nexpand the program. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2022.pdf", "page": 53, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
