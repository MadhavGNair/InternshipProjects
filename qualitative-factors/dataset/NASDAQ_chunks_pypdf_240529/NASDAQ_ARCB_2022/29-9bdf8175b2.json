Kirk Weis, an ABF road driver in Albuquerque, \nNew Mexico, and an America\u2019s Road Team Captain, designed \nthe course, and all drivers were welcomed to compete. \nThe competition consisted of a written exam, pre-trip \ninspection where drivers looked for defects in the truck \nsuch as a key in the ignition, the fire extinguisher exhausted, \nloose fuel caps and unsecured hazardous materials, and \ncompleting the driving course. The driving course also included \nan egg toss and basketball dunk to make things fun while \nemphasizing precision. \u201cIt is an honor to be named the first ABF Road Team TDC Champion! It is \nawesome to know that I am the first person to get his name on the trophy, \nconsidering the guys I was up against.\u201d \nAllen McNeely \ndriver/salesmanABF Truck Driving Championship \nTop three winners:\nAllen McNeely (driver/salesman at \nCharlotte, North Carolina) \nMatt Meadows (driver/salesman at \nCharleston, West Virginia) \nTeddy Butler (driver/salesman at \nAtlanta, Georgia, and an America\u2019s \nRoad Team Captain)\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2022.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
