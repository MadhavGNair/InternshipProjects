To help \nadvance this initiative, we launched employee \nresource groups \u2014 voluntary, employee-led groups \nthat help create an open and welcoming space to \nfoster community building for employees\u2019 shared \nidentities, experiences or interest in supporting \nunderrepresented talent. Employees can \nparticipate in ERGs as either members or allies, \nand the company sponsors each group through \nallocated resources.  \nTwo ERGs formed in 2022 \u2014 Pride Network \nand CoNECT (Colleagues Networking and \nEmbracing Community Ties) \u2014 with 65 employees \nparticipating. Pride Network focuses on creating \na positive environment for LGBTQ+ employees \nand promoting education, visibility and allyship. \nCoNECT (previously the New Hire Focus Group) \nprovides a welcoming community for new \nemployees who have recently relocated or are \nlooking for support in making new connections.
