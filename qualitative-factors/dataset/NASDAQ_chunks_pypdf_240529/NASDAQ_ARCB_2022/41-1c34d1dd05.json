These surveys provide feedback on where our recruiting and onboarding efforts are succeeding and \nareas where we could improve. In 2022, we received an over \n80% average favorability score across all surveys with 1,299 \nresponses and more than 300 new hires completing all surveys. \nMock Interviews   \nArcBest was a corporate sponsor for the University of Arkansas \nFirst-Year Engineering Program Student Mock Interview Week. \nFifty-one ArcBest volunteers supported the virtual event after \nattending training with university staff on goals, expectations \nand the interview process.
