{"page_content": "20  |  EnvironmentGreenhouse Gas Emissions \nIn 2022, through collaboration with ArcBest Technologies, we \nvoluntarily disclosed our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions for \nthe first time in company history. We also began developing a \nmethodology to measure and calculate our Scope 3 emissions and \nhave made considerable progress in understanding this category \nof our emissions. Through this work, we identify where in our \nbusiness and operations we are making the most impact and \nare moving toward setting Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions \nreduction targets. We also recognize that, given our role in the \nsupply chain, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions will \ncontribute to further reducing the Scope 3 emissions of other \nentities within our value chain. \nWe continue working with ArcBest Technologies to collect and \nanalyze our GHG emissions data and will report Scope 3 data after \ndeveloping an appropriate methodology. We also look forward to \nsharing more about our GHG emissions management and progress \nin future updates.  \nGross Global Scope\n1 Emissions\n501,593\nMetric tons (t) CO2eGross Global Scope\n2 Emissions\n16,364\nMetric tons (t) CO2e\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2022.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
