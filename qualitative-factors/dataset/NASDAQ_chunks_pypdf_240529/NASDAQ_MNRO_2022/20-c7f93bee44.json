We partner with a third party to collect \nfeedback on 10 critical touchpoints we have with the guests, collect \nonline customer reviews and also track feedback through our call center. \nWhile we have collected feedback consistently throughout our history, \nwe have increased resources dedicated to processing and taking action. \nFor example, these increased resources led to improvements to our \nresponse time on calls.\nPRODUCT SOURCING \nWe aim for our customers\u2019 positive experiences at Monro to continue \nlong after they leave the store. To that end, we engage with trusted, \ntop tier suppliers to provide high quality products and parts and offer \nwarranties on a substantial number of the products and services we \nprovide to help build the trust of our customers.\nAll suppliers must meet minimum standards before doing business \nwith Monro. We are working to enhance our supplier assessment and \napproach through a tiered system based on size and impact to the \nconsumer. We will include environmental and social criteria in our \nsupplier evaluation. \nDuring this past year we also put in place technology improvements that \nallow for closer real-time connectivity with the supply chain so we can \nensure the products our customers want are available. This, in addition \nto better forecasting, has allowed us to be able to offer products within \neach of our good, better, best product offering tiers.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MNRO_2022.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
