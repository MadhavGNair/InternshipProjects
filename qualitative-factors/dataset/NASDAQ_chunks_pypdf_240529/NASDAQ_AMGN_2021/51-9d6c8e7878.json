Water usage decreases are a result of \nwater reclamation projects, irrigation control enhancements \nand completion of equipment commissioning (which \ntemporarily increased water usage in 2020) .  Since 2007, we \nhave avoided the usage of 1 million CM annually through the \nimplementation of water innovation and efficiency projects  .WASTE \nWaste disposed decreased in 2021 primarily due to an \nincrease in the Amgen Rhode Island waste-to-energy \nconversion at a nearby facility  . The Amgen Rhode Island \nmanufacturing facilities now divert 80% of landfill waste \nto the waste-to-energy facility  .\n* Amgen Sustainability program base year  .  ** 2027 Plan base year  .ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 51, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
