These programs limit patient out-of-pocket \ncosts for certain treatments, including for multiple \nmyeloma, giant cell tumor of the bone, homozygous \nfamilial hypercholesterolemia, metastatic colorectal \ncancer, cancer-related bone complications, and acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia .\nWorking With Partners to Reach Patients \nIn 2021, our longtime partner Direct Relief distributed \nAmgen products we donated to support underserved \npatients in more than 20 countries, from Haiti and India to \nLiberia and Syria .  In total, medicines donated provided more \nthan 900,000 daily doses of treatment to patients  . \nOur Approach to Responsible Pricing\nEvery day, we work to discover, develop and deliver \nbreakthrough medicines that make a difference to patients\u2019 \nlives and address some of society\u2019s most serious diseases  . \nInnovative medicines offer our best opportunity to effectively \nmanage disease and contain long-term healthcare costs, \nwhich is why Amgen prices its medicines responsibly, \npartners with payers to align on value, and develops patient \nsupport programs to help ensure broad access to our novel \ntherapies for appropriate patients  .\nAmgen understands that the cost of prescription medicines \nis a concern for many people  . We are committed to the \nresponsible pricing of our medicines by considering their \neconomic and social value and the clinical and economic \nburden of diseases  . In each of the years since 2018, the \naverage net price for Amgen medicines has declined  .\nIn addition to responsible pricing, Amgen has implemented \nvalue-based contracting to help improve patient access to \ninnovative medicines and offer stakeholders greater budget \npredictability  . Also, our high-quality biosimilars are backed \nby four decades of biologics expertise and can potentially \noffer more affordable, life-altering treatment options that \ncontribute to the sustainability of our healthcare system .VALUE CREATION \nProviding access to our \nmedicines is an extension \nof Amgen\u2019s mission to \nserve patients.\nThrough our access to medicines programs, \nwe work with partners to expand access \nto our medicines and support efforts to \nstrengthen healthcare systems to better \nserve patients in need worldwide  .
