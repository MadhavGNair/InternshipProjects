It might as well have arrived empty  . \nThe humid, subtropical climate had already taken its toll .\nDr . Trish Scanlan said the medicine, which must be kept at a \ntemperature between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, had arrived \nfrom Dar Es Salam in the loose, insecure package  . Over the \nhours on its journey, the medicine had warmed  . It was useless  .\n\u201cAn absolute disaster,\u201d Scanlan said  . \u201cIt meant the cancer was \ngetting a break in a child who needs that medicine now  .\u201d\nFor Scanlan, director of the nonprofit children\u2019s cancer  \ncharity Tumaini La Maisha, seeing medicine being wasted  \nwas too much .  \nIn 2021, she found help through a California-based nonprofit, \nDirect Relief, and Amgen .  Both stepped in, supporting \nMuhimbili National Hospital and Tumaini La Maisha with a \ncold room that cost nearly $20,000 that keeps medicines at \nthe low temperatures needed  . Direct Relief is also supplying \nTumaini La Maisha with 50 thermal packages that can be \nreused for up to five years, while Amgen is donating $12 .5 \nmillion10 worth of oncology supportive care medicine  .\nHigh-Tech Packages\nThe thermal packages began arriving in Tanzania in April .  \nMike Wooten, Direct Relief cold chain specialist, said the boxes \nthat will carry the cancer treatments are a mix of high-end data technology and old-school durability that shouldn\u2019t pose \nany problems for shipping medicine overnight in Tanzania .\nEach package, about 8 liters, has a battery-operated data \nlogger to keep track of the temperatures as the box is \ntransported, to make sure the medications inside never go \nabove the ideal temperatures  . He said the packages are good \nfor about 80 hours in worst-case weather  . Meanwhile, the \ncold storage unit will enable bulk purchases for medications \nwithout fears of spoiling  .\nThe Work\nScanlan said about 4,000 children in Tanzania will develop \ncancer each year, but less than a quarter of those currently \nseek care  . She said the arrival of the cold chain supplies will \nallow more children to get life-saving treatment and spend \nless time in the hospitals  .\n\u201cWe can send boxes of chemo every week and look after \nthe children in the peripheral areas,\u201d Scanlan said  . \u201cThat \nmeans the children have to spend far less time of their life \nin the hospital and can be at home with their family \nbetween treatments  .\u201d\nAs a cancer survivor herself, Scanlan knows the pain and \nstruggle of the fight .  She said she won\u2019t be satisfied until the \nthousands of children suffering with cancer in Tanzania all \nhave access to treatment .\nThat\u2019s the work .  And the mission .
