In 2021, we \nupgraded our LEED design and construction standards \nfrom Sliver to Gold certification for all new buildings and \nmajor renovations  .This includes the design, construction, \nand operation of our planned new facilities in Ohio and \nNorth Carolina .  LEED is the most widely used green \nbuilding rating system in the world  .\nWe also initiated an internal carbon fee as part of our \ninvestment lifecycle management (ILM) process, which \nincludes capital projects and building leases  . Beginning in \n2021, this process now requires project-specific sustainability \nplans and assigns an internal price to carbon emissions, \nwater intake, and waste generation .  For example, projects \nthat increase carbon emissions above an established \nthreshold are charged an internal carbon fee to help ensure \nthat the impact to the environment is accounted for in our \ndecision-making as we consider alternative options with \nlower environmental footprints  .WASTE  \nWe plan to reduce 75% of waste disposed31 \nthrough recycling and reuse of waste materials \nsent to landfills or disposed via combustion or \nincineration without energy recovery  . In 2021, three Amgen \nsites did not send any waste to landfills  . \nWhile our strategy prioritizes innovation and efficiency to \nreduce waste before it\u2019s generated, for 2021 Amgen Rhode \nIsland transferred the majority of the landfill waste it did \ngenerate to a neighboring state for energy recovery  . The \nchange was made, in part, because the Rhode Island Central \nLandfill, which provides disposal for 97% of Rhode Island \nresidents, is projected to reach its capacity in the next decade  . \nWaste-to-energy incineration is a better alternative \nto landfills for waste disposal and actually \nreduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions \nin the atmosphere  .\nJIM RAWLEY , Environmental Healthy & Safety \nManager at Amgen Rhode Island\u201c\n\u201d\nMask Recycling \u2013 A Silver Lining of the COVID Cloud \nThe emergence of COVID-19 in 2020 brought with it the \nneed for our employees to wear personal protective \nequipment (PPE), including masks, and in some cases \ngloves at Amgen facilities  . However, while helping protect \nthe safety of employees and contractors at our sites, we \nalso wanted to mitigate unnecessary waste  . \nBeginning in July 2020, we partnered with a global leader \nin recycling hard-to-recycle materials to help  . Through our \npartnership, our employees can dispose of used PPE in onsite \ncollection boxes  . Our third-party vendor then breaks down \nthe used PPE into its component fibers and plastics, which \ncan be used to create new products such as plastic lumber \nfor park benches  . Through 2021 we recycled\u2014and diverted \nfrom landfills\u2014approximately one metric ton of masks at \nour corporate headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California .\n31  Reductions take into account only verified reduction projections, do not take \ninto account changes associated with the contraction or expansion of the \nCompany and are measured against a 2019 baseline  .ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 47, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
