Since 2010, Amgen has reported \nto the CDP and you can find our most recent CDP reports \nfor Climate Change and Water here  . Our reports provide \nadditional details about Amgen\u2019s governance, strategy, \nrisk management, metrics, and targets related to climate \nchange and water  .\n \nOver time, CDP\u2019s disclosure platform for climate change has \nevolved to contain over 25 questions (within its governance, \nrisks and opportunities, strategy, targets and emissions \nmodules) that are aligned with the recommendations of the \nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD; \nthis platform is now nearly in full alignment with the TCFD  . \nWe continue to report to the CDP as completely as possible \nand, in 2022, we are undertaking a TCFD-aligned scenario \nanalysis assessment to improve our understanding of the \nphysical and transitional effects of climate change as well \nas to inform our future reporting  . Additionally, while the \nCompany\u2019s 2027 environmental sustainability targets do \nnot incorporate Scope 3 emissions, we continue exploring \napproaches to better understand this area, including \nidentifying potential emissions reduction opportunities in \nour value chain .2021 PERFORMANCE DATA\nWe measure and report on our overall carbon emissions, \nenergy, water use, and waste disposed  . We include data \ngathered from 16 manufacturing, R&D, and distribution \nfacilities located in North America, South America, Asia, and \nEurope, representing (based on square footage) approximately \n88% of our operations  . For the remaining 12% of square \nfootage, primarily administrative offices, we estimate energy \nusage to calculate carbon emissions  . We measure progress \ntoward our targets by quantifying results independent of \ngrowth or contraction of our business  . We do not include \nfacility or building closures or recently acquired facilities in \nour target progress  . Our 2021 environmental data have \nundergone a reasonable assurance audit .  Highlights of our \nenvironmental performance are presented below; more \ndetailed data can be found here  . ENERGY\nIn 2021, we increased the amount of renewable energy in \nour purchased electricity to 79% compared to 41% in 2020 .  \nWe purchased in-country renewable energy certificates to \nmake our facilities in Thousand Oaks, CA; West Greenwich, \nRI; Louisville, KY; Cambridge, MA; Breda, Netherlands; and \nSingapore use 100% renewable electricity  . This is in addition \nto our GreenPower Purchase Plans with local utilities at our \nfacility in Ireland and our two locations in Great Britain .\n2021 Energy Use by Source\n(1,000 GJ)\n7\n3831,131\n16091,0607\n3831,131\n16091,060\nRenewables Fossil FuelNuclear Natural Gas Diesel\nPropane", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
