Johnson\u2019s house  . Dr . Johnson, a family friend, often let her \ncome to a lab to see chemistry experiments in action and it \nthrilled her  .\nThat path was solidified through high school and college \nas O\u2019Neal earned scholarships and science awards and \nobtained her bachelor\u2019s degree in chemical engineering \nfrom Howard University  .\nIn 2021, she took another step \u2013 working towards a master\u2019s \ndegree and joining Amgen as a part of the Amgen Educational \nFellowship at Howard University in its inaugural year  . The \nprogram provides its fellows further insights into a career \nin science, including what a career at Amgen looks like and \nunderstanding the Company\u2019s interest in adding diversity to \nits research ranks  . \u201cIt was the excitement of connecting \nscience to the real world,\u201d O\u2019Neal says. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t magic or ambiguous. It was \nrelatable to everything.\u201d\nPILAR O\u2019NEAL loved science from an early age, doing \ndissections or investigating the ingredients in everyday \nhousehold items to understand the chemistry that made \nthem what they were  .\u201cThis program exemplifies our commitment to improving \ndiversity and inclusion throughout Amgen and our Research & \nDevelopment organization,\u201d said Alan Russell, Vice President, \nResearch at Amgen .  \u201cWe hope it will serve as a flagship to expand \nto other departments at Howard University and other HBCUs  .\u201d\nDuring the first year of the program, students will be at \nHoward working with mentors from the Howard University \nDepartment of Chemical Engineering  . During the second \nyear, they will be onsite at an Amgen location for six months \nworking on research projects  .\nBram Estes, a senior scientist in biologics at Amgen, is O\u2019Neal\u2019s \nmentor, working with her on a project connected to DNA protein \nco-delivery into cells and intracellular routing and uptake of \nbiologics  . He has high hopes for both the project and O\u2019Neal .\n\u201cI would like her to publish her research in the Amgen-Howard \ncollaboration, both to advance science and to establish her \nreputation in the scientific community,\u201d Estes said  . \u201cThis project \nis the beginning of what I hope will be a great career  .\u201d\nO\u2019Neal agrees  . When she completes the program in two years, \nshe will have her graduate degree and, she hopes, a chance to \nfulfill a lifelong dream \u2013 to contribute to the world of science  .\n\u201cMy goal is to help my community and to help humanity,\u201d O\u2019Neal \nsays  . \u201cSo maybe one day, even if I help just a few people, I\u2019ll have \nmade a positive impact on the world  .\u201d\n32  |  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
