In addition, \nin 2021, we announced plans for the construction of new \nfacilities in Ohio and North Carolina .  At both, we are \nembedding environmental sustainability into upfront project \ndesign, development, and execution .  For example, at our \nnew multiproduct drug substance manufacturing facility in \nNorth Carolina, we expect our carbon footprint and water \nusage to be substantially lower than at a traditional drug \nsubstance manufacturing plant due to deployment of \ninnovative technologies and resource conservation .  The site will \nuse traditional drug substance technologies and Amgen\u2019s \nlatest innovations to create a facility called FleXBatch .  \n\u201cThis new FleXBatch plant exemplifies Amgen\u2019s approach \nto innovative and sustainable biomanufacturing, which\u2014\nI\u2019m pleased to announce \u2013 we are now calling Amgen \nEcovationTM,\u201d said Bob Bradway, Amgen CEO  . \u201c This new name \nunderscores what is today and has always been distinctive \nabout biomanufacturing at Amgen: It is highly innovative, \nefficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable \u2013 all in the \nservice of benefiting patients with medicines manufactured \naccording to the highest quality standards  .\u201dIn Ohio, we are building our new final product advanced \nassembly and packaging plant to LEED27 standards to \nmaximize energy efficiency and waste reduction .  \nElectric Vehicles \nBy 2027, we plan to convert 30% of our sales fleet vehicles \nto electric vehicles (EV) .28 In 2021, we launched an EV pilot \nprogram in the United States, the Netherlands and South \nKorea, enabling sales representatives and medical liaisons \nto upgrade their traditional fuel-operated vehicle to a new \nelectric vehicle  . Our program also includes EV charging \ninfrastructure improvements in the EV marketplace  . \nRenewable Energy\nThe generation and procurement of clean, renewable energy \nis an important component of achieving our 2027 carbon \nneutrality target .29 Across our network, each Amgen facility \nhas a portfolio of renewable energy projects  . Projects range \nfrom installing innovative renewable energy technologies, \nsuch as onsite solar arrays, to purchasing electricity from \nrenewable sources  . In 2021, we increased the number of \nfacilities sourcing renewable energy, including our major \nNorth American sites in Rhode Island and our headquarters \nin California; our aim is for all Amgen facilities, wherever \nfeasible, to procure 100% renewable electricity by 2027 .  \nOur carbon neutrality target applies to Amgen-owned and\n-operated facilities and operations  .\nAt the end of 2021, renewable electricity accounted for 79% of \nour total electricity consumption, compared to 41% in 2020 .  \nWe achieved this increase in renewable electricity through\nthe purchase of renewable energy certificates for electricity \nconsumption at our North American facilities  .WATER  \nWe plan to achieve our water reduction target30 \nof 40% by emphasizing water treatment and \nrecycling as well as reduced primary usage  . While \nour strategy is global, we work with different Amgen sites \nparticularly in water-stressed regions  . \nAmgen completed externally validated water studies at \neach of our major manufacturing sites in 2021 to identify \nadditional reduction opportunities  . We also established a \ncross-functional water sustainability team to share projects \nand best practices globally  . \nBy the end of 2021, Amgen had identified more than 90 \npotential water reduction projects  . These are being reviewed \nfor viability and prioritization, including some key projects \ninvolving large utility systems such as reverse osmosis skids \nand cooling towers  . In 2021, Amgen developed water \nreduction pipeline proposals with the potential for high \nimpact at facilities in water-stressed regions  . \n26 As of September 30, 2021 .\n27  Developed by the U .S .  Green Building Council, LEED is a set of rating systems \nfor the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings, \nhomes and neighborhoods  .\n28 Based on a 2019 baseline  .\n29 Carbon neutrality goal refers to Scope 1 and 2 emissions  .\n30  Reductions take into account only verified reduction projections, do not take \ninto account changes associated with the contraction or expansion of the \nCompany and are measured against a 2019 baseline  .
