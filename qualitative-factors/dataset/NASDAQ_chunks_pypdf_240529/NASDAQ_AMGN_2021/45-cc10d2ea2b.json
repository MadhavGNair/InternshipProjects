Research also shows \nthat, far too often, people of color and people living \nin low-income communities live and work in places \nin areas with increased risks from climate change \nand are more likely to have chronic lung disease  .25\nAs a Company focused on improving health and \nsaving lives, Amgen is determined to be part of the \nsolution .  In September 2021, we sponsored a virtual \nExpert Voices roundtable (hosted by a leading \nnational news outlet Axios) to hear how stakeholders \nfrom across disciplines are addressing challenges, and \nto better understand how Amgen can collaborate to make an impact .  Leaders, subject matter experts, \nand policy makers from various geographies and \ndisciplines gathered virtually to discuss the widening \nsocioeconomic disparities and preventative measures  . \nThey also shared ideas on how to better prepare for \nfuture and long-term effects of climate change on \nlung health .  To read more about the conversation, \nvisit Axios' event recap here  .\nAmgen is also seeking to support lung health through \na new collaboration with the Asthma and Allergy \nFoundation of America (AAFA) .  The collaboration aims \nto help reduce disparities in asthma prevalence, \nhealthcare utilization and mortality among \nunderserved, high-risk populations through the \nHealth Equity Advancement and Leadership \nprogram (HEAL) .  AAFA will work in 2022 with \ncommunity-based partners to increase patient \nknowledge, strengthen patient and physician \ncommunications, and help address asthma symptoms  . \n25 American Lung Association .EXPLORING CLIMATE CHANGE AND LUNG HEAL THENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
