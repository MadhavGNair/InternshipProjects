ETHICAL RESEARCH \nCLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \nAt any given time, Amgen may conduct or is conducting \nhundreds of clinical trials involving many thousands of \npatients  . The rights, dignity, safety, and well-being of trial \nparticipants are critical to the effective conduct of Amgen \nclinical trials  . To that end, our Global Code of Ethics governs \nthe design and conduct of Amgen-sponsored clinical trials  . \nOur high standards meet or exceed applicable local laws as \nwell as widely accepted international regulatory standards  .\nAmgen is committed to the timely registration of clinical \ntrials, communication of research results, and routine publi-\ncation of Amgen-sponsored trials and observational studies  . \nWe support the data-sharing initiatives and principles adopt-\ned by leading industry organizations, including the European \nFederation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations \n(EFPIA) and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical \nManufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) .  \nAmgen is committed to providing scientifically accurate, \ntruthful, nonmisleading, and well-balanced results to the \nscientific community \u2013 regardless of trial outcome or regulatory \napproval .  We aim to submit the results of the primary analysis \nof all completed Amgen-sponsored phase 2 and phase 3 \nstudies (and some phase 1 studies) to medical congresses or peer-reviewed journals within 18 months of trial completion .  In \naddition, we post technical summary results on the registries \nin which the study was registered  . We also register certain \nAmgen-sponsored noninterventional studies on the EU PAS \nRegister before the start of data collection, including \n \u2022 post-authorization safety studies  .\n \u2022  other noninterventional studies when requested by  \nour protocol governance committees, such as non- \ninterventional studies planned for submission to  \nhealth authorities in a marketing application .\nIn 2021, in compliance with the EU Clinical Trial Regulation, \nwe began providing plain-language summaries of trial results \nfor all new interventional clinical trials that include sites in \nthe EU .  Summaries are publicly available in every language \nused during the clinical trial on the Amgen Trials webpage, \nTrial Results Summaries portal, and, as applicable, on the EU \nClinical Trials Information System .  \nWe continue to advance our work to improve diversity and \nrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority populations in \nclinical trial research at Amgen by advancing solutions and \nadvancing dialogue across the industry  . We have developed \na framework to embed inclusive research principles across \nour clinical trial lifecycle process  .
