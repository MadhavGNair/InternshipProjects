{"page_content": "Healthy People\n23  |  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021\nIntroduction COVID-19 Response Healthy Society Healthy Planet A Healthy Amgen Appendix\nHEAL TH EQUITY\nfifths of cancer patients in the United States are treated  . To \nreach these patients\u2014many of whom are from lower-income \nbackgrounds\u2014we established the Amgen Community \nOncology Research Collaborators program .  This initiative \nmakes it easier for community oncologists at more than 200 \nsites across the United States to refer their patients to studies \nof Amgen\u2019s investigational cancer medicines  . Since its inception \nin 2018, we have offered oncologists at sites participating in \nthe program more than 65 new clinical trial opportunities for \ntheir patients, representing a 2,100% increase  .\nWe are also supporting a study led by the Leukemia & \nLymphoma Society and the University of Florida to develop \nand assess the effectiveness of a novel online training program \ndesigned to increase primary care providers\u2019 understanding \nof cancer clinical trials and their capacity to encourage patients \nto inquire about clinical trials when making treatment decisions  . \nThe study will include 400 providers who predominantly \ntreat patients underrepresented in clinical trials  . Study results \nare expected by early 2023 .\nThrough support from Amgen, our longtime partner the \nLazarex Cancer Foundation recently launched several \ninnovative community-based Cancer Wellness HUBs in \npartnership with the University of Southern California\u2019s \nNorris Comprehensive Cancer Center  . These HUBs bring \nexisting cancer education and awareness efforts directly to residents of underrepresented and vulnerable communities  . \nThis partnership is designed to provide residents of \nunderserved communities with access to the latest \navailable research, information about current clinical trials, \ntechnology, access to available lifestyle improvement \nprograms, and opportunities to optimize health outcomes  . \nThey also offer a safe space for residents to talk about health \nconcerns, including disease prevention, survivorship, and \nend-of-life issues  . One of the key goals of the HUBs is to \nconnect patients to clinical trials  . \n\u201cThe Lazarex Cancer Foundation is helping raise awareness \nof the benefits of clinical trials for many here in Los Angeles,\u201d \nsaid Freddie Muse Jr  ., a prostate cancer survivor and founder \nof The Men\u2019s Cancer Network in Los Angeles  . \u201cThis is especially \nimportant for people of color, many of whom have concerns \nand misconceptions about trials based on historical incidents  . \nThe Men\u2019s Cancer Network is working with Lazarex, to not \nonly change mindsets, but to help our community navigate \naccess to trials  . Lazarex is helping our network get reimbursed \nfor the costs associated with travel to and from clinical trials, \nlodging, and meals\u2014seemingly small, but potentially \nsignificant, barriers to access for many  .\u201d\nAddressing Health Equity Through Comprehensive \nHealth Education \nHistorically underrepresented populations have lower \nrates of screening and diagnosis for many life-threatening \nconditions\u2014from cancer and heart disease to osteoporosis \nand rheumatoid arthritis  . Delays in diagnosis in some cases \nmean patients do not receive access to potentially life-saving \ntreatments until it is too late, leading to higher mortality \nrates for underrepresented and underserved populations  . One group at risk is Black women who have undergone \ntreatment for breast cancer and may be at an increased risk \nfor osteoporosis and bone fracture  . For the second year in \na row, Amgen partnered with the Tigerlily Foundation to \nraise awareness among young women, women of color, and \nunderserved communities regarding bone health and its \nimpact specifically on breast cancer patients  . Through \neducation and multimedia efforts, the campaign reached \nmore than six million people  . \nWe are also working with TOUCH, the Black Breast Cancer \nAlliance, to help the Black breast cancer community \nadvocate for the best healthcare possible  . Amgen is \nsupporting Touch\u2019s \u201cThe Doctor is In: Bone Health Campaign,\u201d \nthat includes a weekly web series, and a #LoveYourBones \nsocial media campaign to connect women to educational \nblogs, resources, and events featuring testimonials and tips \nfor maintaining healthy bones  . \nWorking to Raise Health Awareness Through Trusted \nCommunity Leaders \nReligious leaders are among the most trusted members \nof local communities, providing vital information on social \nservices, education, and health to their congregations  . We \nwork with the Health Education Advocacy Learning (HEAL) \ncollaborative, which partners with faith-based organizations \nto help make communities of color healthier  . \nAmgen is supporting a number of HEAL initiatives in \nGeorgia, Ohio, Texas, and Maryland to raise awareness of \ndiseases that disproportionately affect undeserved \ncommunities and people of color, including osteoporosis, ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
