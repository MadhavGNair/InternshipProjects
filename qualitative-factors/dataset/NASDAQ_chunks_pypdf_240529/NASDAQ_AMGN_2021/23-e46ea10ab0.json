The \nprogram includes information on risk factors, channels \nfor accessing care, and seeks to raise awareness about \nparticipating in clinical trials for potential treatments  . \n\u201cOur work with Amgen has put a spotlight on diseases \nthat most people, including those from underrepresented \ncommunities, have cursory or no knowledge at all about \nsymptoms, let alone available screenings or clinical trials,\u201d \nsaid Howard Mosby, who serves as one of the leaders of \nHEAL .  \u201cAmgen has proved through its work with us that it \nis not interested in checking off boxes, but wants to see the \nneedle move as a result of education and policy change  .\u201d \nAddressing Social Determinants of Health \nRecent data13 show that disparities in cardiovascular risk \nfactors between Black and White adults in the United States \nmay be largely attributable to social determinants of health .  \nTo improve our understanding of this issue, Amgen partnered \nwith Humana to conduct a study among patients who have \nbeen hospitalized for cardiovascular-related conditions  . \nSocial determinants of health can have a greater impact \non health outcomes than clinical factors, especially within \nunderserved populations  . Barriers most often reported by respondents included food \ninsecurity, financial strain, housing quality, and transportation \nbarriers  . In terms of the groups most likely to face social \ndeterminants of health barriers, 68% of White survey \nrespondents reported no social needs, while more than half \n(54%) of Black survey respondents reported at least one \nsocial need  . Amgen and Humana will use the findings to \nidentify, implement, and evaluate potential interventions  .
