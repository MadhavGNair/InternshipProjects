As a Senior Specialty Sales Representative \nin Northern California, he visits physicians as much as two \nhours away from his home across a large rural territory that \nstretches from Yreka to Davis, California .  When he received an \nemail asking for volunteers to join a new electric vehicle pilot \nprogram for Amgen\u2019s U .S .  field fleet, the self-described \u201ccar \nand technology nerd\u201d jumped at the chance to take part .\n\u201cI was excited to join the pilot program \nbecause I know electric vehicles are the\nfuture,\u201d said Meeks. \u201cAlong with the \nsustainability benefits, they\u2019re fun to drive!\u201d\nGlobally, Amgen\u2019s field fleet represents around 15% of \nthe Company\u2019s overall carbon footprint, making it the third \nlargest contributor of carbon emissions, behind Amgen\u2019s \nmanufacturing facilities in Juncos, Puerto Rico, and \nThousand Oaks, Calif  .\nThe goal of the pilot program is to capture lessons learned \nin preparation for launching a minimum of 1,800 electric \nvehicles on the road globally by 2027 .  \u201cIt will take global participation to help Amgen reach carbon \nneutrality32 by 2027,\u201d said Yanina Barrera, Ph .D  ., Principal \nEngineer, Engineering Technical Authority, who leads \nAmgen\u2019s sustainability efforts to increase electrification33 of \nthe field fleet to at least 30%, \u201c and electrifying our fleet in \ncountries that are ready is critical to making that happen . \u201d\nThe pilot has not been without challenges, ranging from the \nlower mileage range of electric vehicles paired with limited \ncharging infrastructure availability in some territories, and \nthe lack of available vehicles due to supply chain issues  . \nNevertheless, as of January 1, 2022, Barrera\u2019s team has placed \norders for 195 electric vehicles, which have been assigned \nto field staff  . Planning is also underway for deployment \nof all-electric vehicles in other geographies, and we have \nlaunched the program in the Netherlands and South Korea .\nTo support the transition, Amgen is providing home charger \ninstallation and hosting driver workshops to educate on \nissues such as public charging stations and reimbursement \nprocesses for electricity usage  .\nFor Meeks, its an experience he has been glad to be part of  . \n\u201cI look forward to driving the car -- It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s high tech, and \nit puts a smile on my face every time  .\u201d\nELECTRIC VEHICLE PILOT PROGRAM ADVANCES \nCARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL32\n32 Carbon neutrality goal refers to Scope 1 and 2 emissions  .\n33 Based on a 2019 baseline  .\n50  |  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 49, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
