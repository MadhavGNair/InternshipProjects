It also studied the long-term consequences of \nthe virus, developing models for assessing the impact of \nvaccination against the COVID-19 virus and its spread among \nthe unvaccinated  .Helping Iceland Control COVID-19 \nThrough Genetic Research\nAs early as July 2020, world health officials were praising the \nefforts of Iceland in its control and prevention of COVID-19 .  \nMeanwhile, healthcare officials in the country itself were \npraising the contributions of Amgen\u00b4s subsidiary in Iceland, \ndeCODE Genetics, for its support in helping them get ahead \nof the rapidly spreading virus  . \nIn 2020, researchers at deCODE began working with the \nIcelandic government to screen for COVID-19 among \nthose who were asymptomatic and those diagnosed and \nsymptomatic  . They then sequenced the virus from all \ndiagnosed with COVID-19 and continued doing so \nthroughout 2021 .  To date, Iceland is the only country in \nthe world where COVID-19 has been fully sequenced in \nall patients diagnosed with the virus  .\nAccording to health officials, this large scale and early testing \nconducted by deCODE gave the country the information it \nneeded to tailor its response to the pandemic  . \n\u201cIt is evident now that deCODE\u2019s screening gave us valuable \ninsight into the situation,\u201d said I\u00f0unn Gar\u00f0arsd\u00f3ttir, Political \nAdvisor to Icelandic Health Minister Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir  .7Supporting Communities During COVID-19 \nBuilding on our efforts in 2020 when Amgen and the Amgen \nFoundation committed up to $12 .5 million to support COVID-19 \nrelief efforts, in 2021 the Amgen Foundation donated an \nadditional $1 .25 million to organizations continuing to assist \ncountries around the world  . Our support in 2021 included a \n$500,000 grant to Direct Relief, helping them provide portable \noxygen concentrators to hard-hit India .  The Amgen Foundation \nalso matched staff donations to Direct Relief, Project Hope, \nInternational Medical Corps, American India Foundation, \nCARE, Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation of USA, and Oxygen for \nIndia for COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts  . In addition, \nAmgen donated COVID-19 testing equipment, consumables \nsuch as thermometers and gloves, and personal protective \ngear to those on the front line and at greatest risk .  \nMORE INFORMATION  \nCOVID-19 Response$1.25M  \ndonated to organizations \nassisting countries battling COVID-19\n $500,000\ngrant to Direct Relief, \nhelping them provide portable oxygen \nconcentrators to hard-hit IndiaCOVID-19 RESPONSE\n7 Controlling and Preventing Infection Spread in Iceland  .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
