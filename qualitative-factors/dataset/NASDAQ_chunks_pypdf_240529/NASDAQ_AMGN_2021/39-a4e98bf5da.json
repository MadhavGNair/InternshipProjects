An inaugural cohort of 12 fellows \nwas selected from 10 countries  . Over the yearlong fellowship, \nwith financial support from the Amgen Foundation and access \nto Amgen scientists and experts at other STEM-focused \norganizations, each fellow developed their own biotech \ncurriculum \u201cpassion project . \u201d Once final, this resulting curriculum \nwill be available on the ABE website for use in classrooms \neverywhere  . Select members of the inaugural cohort will \ncontinue their Master Teacher engagement by supporting \nthe second cohort of fellows in 2022 .

Despite the impact \nof COVID-19, more than 70 Amgen staff volunteers reached \nnearly 1,000 students across 32 schools in six Amgen U .S .  \ncommunities through virtual classroom visits in 2021 .  For \nstudents, the program provides diverse role models for a \nrange of biotech careers, as well as real-world context for \nscience content in the classroom .  For Amgen volunteers, it \nprovides a rewarding and motivating experience  . \u201cDiversity in STEM needs to be increased by planting the \nseeds of what is possible as early as possible,\u201d says Krista \nDong, Amgen Scientist and ABE Volunteer  .  \u201cI\u2019ve also been \ngenerous with their time, thoughts, opinions and feedback .  \nThey have been instrumental in my development as a scientist \nand I know that I would not be where I am today without \ntheir support .  That is why I choose to volunteer with ABE  .\u201d\nAMGEN SCHOLARS \nAmgen Scholars is an annual summer program that pairs \nover 350 undergraduate students from around the globe \nwith research opportunities at more than 20 world-class \ninstitutions in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and \nCanada .  Since 2006, Amgen Scholars has supported nearly \n4,500 undergraduates from more than 825 colleges and \nuniversities globally, with many alumni now pursuing \nadvanced scientific degrees and careers  . \nPrior to COVID-19, Amgen Scholars supported undergraduates \nfrom over 200 colleges and universities annually to conduct \nresearch in-person at 24 academic institutions around the \nglobe  . While the program has had to pivot during the \npandemic, in 2021, we supported 170 Amgen Scholars, \nthe majority through a virtual experience  . This included a \nfour-day virtual global symposium with alumni, biotech \nprofessionals, and academics who discussed various aspects \nof the biosciences with Amgen Scholars, including life as a \nPhD candidate, science communication, career opportunities \nin academia and industry, and more  .\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
