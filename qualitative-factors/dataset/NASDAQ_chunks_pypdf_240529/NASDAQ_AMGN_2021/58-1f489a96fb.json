Moving forward, \nwe will continue to evolve how we capture, analyze, and \nreport demographic data for our clinical trials  . To learn \nmore, visit page 21 .\nUSE OF ANIMALS IN RESEARCH \nWe are committed to the ethical and responsible treatment \nof animals required to be used in the discovery and \ndevelopment of our medicines  . Amgen is a longtime \nproponent of the principles of Reduction, Refinement, and \nReplacement (\u201cthe 3 Rs\u201d) in the required use of animals in  \nresearch .  Amgen is fully committed to the development and \nuse of scientifically validated alternative testing methods \nthat are acceptable to regulatory authorities and do not \ncompromise patient safety  . We are engaged internally and in \ncross-industry efforts aimed at developing and refining new \nin-vitro testing and predictive systems that hold promise for \nfuture reduction of animal usage  . As part of these activities, \nAmgen works directly with global regulatory authorities to \nincrease the recognition and acceptance of alternative \nmodels where such methods can be used appropriately  .Amgen works to comply with all applicable global laws and \nregulations, including the gold standards of accrediting \nbodies  . We hold our external business partners, including \ncontract research organizations, academic institutions, \nand animal vendors, accountable to the same regulations, \nstandards, and guidelines that govern our internal animal \ncare and use programs  . We have a robust, proactive process \nto monitor their compliance with our standards  . In 2021, we \nupdated our Commitment to the Ethical Use of Animals in \nResearch policy statement to make our oversight process \nmore transparent .\nUSE OF STEM CELLS \nAmgen uses a wide variety of research tools and technologies \nto help discover and develop new therapeutics, including \nanimal or adult cells in preclinical research to help unlock \nnew scientific insights, model complex diseases, screen new \ncompounds, and identify novel medicines  . Amgen also \nuses a small set of commercially available industry standard \nimmortalized cell lines acquired over several decades for \nspecific research-only purposes  . Amgen has not, and does \nnot, perform or fund research in the area of human \nembryonic or fetal stem cells  . In 2021, we published a policy \nposition statement on our use of fetal stem cells, which is \navailable here  .
