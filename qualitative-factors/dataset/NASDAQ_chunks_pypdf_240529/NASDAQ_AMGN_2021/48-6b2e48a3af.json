Since the program began in 2012, we diverted \napproximately 1,950 metric tons of materials \nfrom the landfill through SAM .In 2021, we diverted approximately 82 metric \ntons of materials from landfills through SAM .  \nFor assets not able to be repurposed, SAM \nresponsibly recycled approximately 17 metric \ntons of material .\nSUSTAINABLE PACKAGING  \nAmgen is on a journey to reduce the environmental  \nimpacts of its packaging through its Global Packaging  \nSustainability program .  \nIn 2021, we enhanced our Green Packaging Assessment \nprocess, showing its impact on our carbon footprint .  Moving \nforward, we plan to conduct life-cycle assessments on \nexisting packaging to inform new, more sustainable designs \nfor Amgen products that reduce adverse impacts on the \nvariety of life in the world, or biodiversity  .We also started to phase out use of PVC in secondary \npackaging, an accomplishment our manufacturing sites \nin Ireland and the Netherlands were the first to achieve in \n2021 .  Moreover, in addition to efforts to promote biodiversity, \nwe remain committed to using fully recyclable paperboard \nfrom certified sustainable forests in the packaging of all \nAmgen products and, where regulation allows, to shift to \nelectronic leaflets  . \nIn 2021, the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation \nhonored Amgen with its Healthcare and Scientific Award  . \nThe award showcases Australian industry\u2019s commitment to \nmeeting the nation\u2019s 2025 packaging targets and building \na regenerative, or circular, economy approach to packaging  . \nAmong its efforts, Amgen is participating in the reusable \nCool Green Shipper collaboration with the logistics \ncompany DHL and also examining recyclable and renewable \nalternatives to PVC in packaging trays for several products \npackaged in Australia .\nFINDING NEW HOMES FOR SURPLUS ASSETS\nTo conserve financial resources and reduce environmental \nimpact, Amgen maintains a robust Surplus Asset Management \n(SAM) program, where staff can repurpose or donate \nequipment for reuse  . This includes items such as laboratory, \nmanufacturing, and facilities equipment; office furniture \nand supplies; and carts, glassware, and spare parts  . SAM also \nauctions equipment and donates to nonprofit organizations, \neducational institutions, and programs like the Amgen \nBiotech Experience (see page 39), an innovative science \neducation program that empowers teachers to bring \nbiotechnology into their classrooms  .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
