Amgen\u2019s \nRepresentation in Clinical Research team, also known as \nRISE, is working to address these barriers  . In 2021, RISE led \nengagement with representatives of historically underserved \nand excluded communities through a series of product-\nagnostic community advisory boards  . This helped us obtain \ninsights and perspectives on best practices for engagement \nwith these communities more broadly, with the goal of building \nlong-term, sustainable relationships  . We will continue to seek \nguidance from key community advisors to help ensure that \nour efforts resonate with community needs and highlight \ncommunity members\u2019 voices  .\nIn 2021, we developed, with input from RISE, an enterprise-wide \nframework to strengthen our focus on enhancing diversity \nand representation in clinical trial participation across our \nportfolio  . In addition, we have developed diversity plans for \nmultiple clinical studies that align with industry principles \nand FDA guidance for industry to enhance diversity in \nclinical trials and encourage inclusivity in medical product \ndevelopment  . In early 2022, Amgen announced its support \nfor the CEO Roundtable on Cancer \u2019s new multiyear initiative \nGoing for Gold  . This initiative will work with Historically Black \nColleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions \nto improve health equity, education, navigation, and access  . The program is expected to positively impact more than 20 \nmillion lives, especially among communities disproportionately \naffected by cancer  . Through the initiative, universities can \ncontribute to research efforts through the CEO Roundtable\u2019s \nProject Data Sphere\u00ae, which helps expand access to clinical \ntrial research and offers an open-access digital platform for \naggregating and analyzing data to advance health equity efforts  .\nIncreasing Access to Oncology Trials for \nUnderrepresented Communities \nRecent data from the FDA show that, of total participants in \nclinical trials for oncology products that led to approvals, just 4% were Black participants and 5% were Hispanic \nparticipants, despite the fact that, during this same period, \n13 .4% of the U .S .  population was Black and 18 .1% was \nHispanic  .11 This is even though Black, Indigenous, and People \nof Color overall in the United States have both the highest \ndeath rates and shortest survival rates for most cancers  .12  \nAmgen is investing in programs to increase scientific data \nwith the goal of changing these numbers  . \nOne way to contribute to this change is by bringing historically \nunderrepresented patients into clinical trials conducted \nwhere they live, such as in community clinics where four \nTHREE-YEAR PLAN / SIX PILLARSRISE is working to exceed industry standards for clinical trial diversity and representation \nand to help Amgen develop new medicines studied in participants who better reflect the \npopulations impacted by certain diseases or conditions  .\n11  Oncology Leaders Take Action to Curb Lack of Diversity in Clinical Trials  .\n12  Improving Diversity and Inclusion in Cancer Clinical Trials and Research .Evolve the way \nwe design and \nrun clinical \ntrials, focusing on \npeople who have \nbeen historically \nexcluded from \nclinical researchPartner with \nclinical trial \ninvestigators who \nare representative \nof the participants \nthey are aiming \nto recruitBring the \nresearch \ndirectly to the \ncommunities \nwhere people \nlive and workChange how \nresearchers \ncommunicate \nwith patients, \ncaregivers, \nand providersEnhance \nprecision \nmedicine \nawareness and \nimprove genetic \ndiversity in \ntranslational \nscienceCollaborate \nwith national \nand \ncommunity \norganizations", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
