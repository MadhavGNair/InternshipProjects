{"page_content": "A SAFER, MORE  \nSECURE WORLD\nThe security and industrial \nmarket is always evolving, \nrepresenting new challenges for \ngovernments and technologies. \nFrom tackling global terrorism \nthreats to reducing the \nhealth risks associated with \ncontaminated foods, we \ncollaborate with our customers \nto develop solutions that can \nbe used to keep people safe. In 2019, Varex acquired X-ray detector \ncompany Direct Conversion, which produces \ndetectors for use in medical, dental, and \nindustrial settings. Their XC-TDI series \ndetectors are particularly valuable in the \nglobal food industry, where they are used to \nscan for foreign objects such as plastics, glass, \nand metals in food items. Through doing so, \nimperfections can be identified in individual \nproducts without having to destroy them. \nWe are also investigating how to address \ncertain sterilization applications with industrial \nX-ray sources.  For example, following the \nwidespread legalization of cannabis, efforts \nhave increased to eliminate harmful mold or \nbacteria by using X-ray sterilization. In addition, \nthere is a desire to replace radioactive sources \ncurrently used to sterilize blood with X-rays \nwith other methods of sterilization.Innovating for a safer world\nThe security products we develop are used \nextensively at global border controls to scan for \ncontraband and radioactive objects. Our X-ray \ncomponents are also important in the industrial \nsector, used in non-destructive testing and \nmanufacturing inspections. In 2019, we invested \nsignificantly in infrastructure to increase the \nreliability and quality of our components for \nsecurity and industrial\u00a0purposes.\nT o ensure the components we develop address \nthe safety requirements of our customers, in \n2019 we set out to better understand the use of \nradiation in product safety in three areas: food; \nblood donations and transfusion; and\u00a0cannabis.  \n14\nABOUT USINSPIRING  \nINNOVATIONPROTECTING THE  \nENVIRONMENTEMPOWERING PEOPLE \nAND\u00a0COMMUNITIESACTING WITH  \nINTEGRITY\nVAREX IMAGING ESG & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VREX_2019.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
