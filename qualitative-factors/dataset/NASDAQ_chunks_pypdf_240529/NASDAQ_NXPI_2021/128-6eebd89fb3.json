{"page_content": "E\u2013SCRAP RECLAIMWASTE\nSemiconductor manufacturing includes dealing with leftover scrap material, such as failed \nproducts and test devices, as well as used metal, engineering materials, and silicon. \nSome scrap material contains precious metals (gold, silver, palladium, platinum) and non\u2013\nprecious metals (copper, tin, nickel). Our e\u2013scrap program ships scrap waste to processing plants that reclaim and recover these valuable (and potentially toxic) metals to reduce  e\u2013waste out of the landfills.\nIn 2021, our e\u2013scrap reclaim rate increased 28% from 2020 and 64% from 2015. In 2021, \nproduction increased 22% compared to 2020, corresponding to the increased amount of reclaim compared to 2020. Since 2015, we have implemented programs to improve the identification and collection of e\u2013scrap, resulting in the longer\u2013term increases achieved.28%\nIncrease from 2020E-SCRAP RECLAIM PERFORMANCE\n64%\nIncrease from 2015\n0200,000400,000600,000800,0001,000,000\n2017 2016 2015 2018 2019 2020 2021Kilogram (kg)E-Scrap Reclaimed\n129 \n2021 HIGHLIGHTS\nOUR BUSINESSECONOMYOVERVIEW\nGOVERNANCE \nESG\nENVIRONMENT\nSUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT\nPRODUCT STEWARDSHIPAPPENDICESEMPLOYEES\nOverview \nManagementEmissionsEnergyWaterWaste   \nPackagingHazardous Materials", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_NXPI_2021.pdf", "page": 128, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
