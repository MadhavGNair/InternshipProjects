{"page_content": "WASTEWATER\nWe are committed to returning water to the environment that is as clean, or cleaner than \nwhat we sourced. We employ onsite water-treatment facilities to treat wastewater outflows, and ensure any chemical constituents from our wastewater that could potentially impact  the environment are avoided. Our facility teams continuously monitor and test our water,  as required by local authorities, and perform better than  local wastewater discharge  permit requires. \nIn late 2020, we included wastewater discharge in our data-management system,  \nand we plan to include detailed measurements for water discharge and evaporation  in our future reports. \nNXP did not receive any excursions, fines, or penalties in 2021 related to  \nwastewater discharge.WATER\n124 \n2021 HIGHLIGHTS\nOUR BUSINESSECONOMYOVERVIEW\nGOVERNANCE \nESG\nENVIRONMENT\nSUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT\nPRODUCT STEWARDSHIPAPPENDICESEMPLOYEES\nOverview \nManagementEmissionsEnergyWaterWaste  PackagingHazardous Materials124 The two manufacturing sites in Austin, ATMC and Oak Hill, both received the City\u2019s 2021 award for Excellence in Wastewater Pretreatment.
