{"page_content": "15Climate-related performance metrics have \nbeen included in the Company\u2019s reporting \nsince it began reporting on sustainability \nmatters. Measuring the emissions profile \nprovides visibility into which cost-efficient \nmeasures are most effective in reducing \nthe Company footprint. The Company continues to improve both the reduction \nof emissions intensity and the transpar-\nency of reporting. The data is recorded \nby third party Environmental Monitoring \n& Auditing Agency for Environmental \nPerformance.Metrics Overview\nThis framework centers around five key \nmetrics groupings in promoting more \nconsistent reporting \u2013 Greenhouse Gas \n(GHG), Flaring, Spills, Water Use, and \nSafety. \nThe following provides a high-level overview of each of these metrics' groupings.\nTethys Oil's net share of Blocks 3&4 in Oman\nMetric 1: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 1)* 2020 2019\nGHG Emissions (metrics tons CO2e) 154,987 177,188\nGHG Intensity \u2013 (GHG Emissions / Gross Annual Production (boe)) Kg per bbl produce 37.5 37.8\nMethane Emissions (Metric tons CH4) 149.9 4.3\nMethane Intensity \u2013 (Methane Emissions (Metric tons CH4)/Gross Annual Production (Mboe)) Kg per bbl produced 0.04 0.00\nNitrous Oxide (Metric Tons N2O) 0.48 0.40\nMetric 2: Flaring \nGross Annual Volume of Flared or Vented Gas (Mcf) 2,260,944 2,721,274 \nVolume of gas flared per barrel of oil equivalent produced  \n(Gross Annual Volume of Flared Gas (Mcf)/Gross Annual Production (boe)) 0.50 0.53\nMetric 3: Liquid Hydrocarbon Spills \nNumber of Spills > 1 Barrel 8 4\nSpill Intensity (Produced Liquids Spilled (bbl)/Total Produced Liquids (Mbbl)) 0.02 0.06\nMetric 4: Water Use \nUtility Water Use (m\u00b3) 2,156 1,152\nNon-Fresh Water consumption intensity bbl/boe 0.93 0.99\nFresh Water Intensity (bbl/boe) 0.3% 0.3%\nTotal Produced Water (m\u00b3) 665,784 807,264\nWater Recycle Rate (Recycled Water (bbl)/Total Produced Water (bbl)) 84% 86%\nMetric 5: Safety\nFatalities \u2013 \u2013\nLost Time Incidents 3 2\nTraffic Accidents 1 3\nTotal Recordable Cases 4 4\nTotal Recordable Cases Frequency (#/mm Hrs) 0.63 0.49\nLost Time Incident Frequency (#/mm Hrs) 0.47 0.24\nRoad Traffic Accident Frequency (#/mm km) 0.07 0.15\n* Scope 1 \u2013 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol refers to emissions that are directly emitted by or controlled by the company at the non-operated producing fields in Oman. Emissions related \nto purchased electricity are Scope 2 emissions and are not included. Emissions from company owned or leased fleet vehicles are not included.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TETY_2020.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
