Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, we have a  \nresearch and development (R&D) center in Waltham, \nMassachusetts; a research and manufacturing facility  \nin Athlone, Ireland; and a manufacturing facility in \nWilmington, Ohio.We are inspired to help address some of the most \npressing public health issues of our time and advance \ninnovation that has the potential to improve treatment \noptions, outcomes, and lives. In 2018, approximately \n130,000 patients were treated with proprietary \nAlkermes medicines and hundreds of thousands  \nmore were treated with medicines developed using \nproprietary Alkermes technologies. Alkermes R&D \nefforts build on our heritage of innovative drug \nformulation, medicinal chemistry and deep scientific \nexpertise.

In this \ncontext we also work to support and enhance the \nsystems in which these medicines are used through \npatient engagement, disease education and awareness, \nand advocacy for important policies that support \nequitable access to quality treatment.
