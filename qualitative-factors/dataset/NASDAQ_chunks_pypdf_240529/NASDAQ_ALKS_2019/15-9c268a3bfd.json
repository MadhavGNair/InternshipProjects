When my boss asked \nme how I approached my work with so much \npassion, I told him, \u2018I see the little boy that keeps \nlooking up in the stands hoping to see his dad.\u2019 \nSo, that\u2019s why I feel that I\u2019m supposed to be \nhere; to help one little boy find his dad in  \nthe stands and not struggle with substance  \nuse disorder.\u201d \n\u2013 District Business Leader at Alkermes\n \u201c I have a teenage daughter. About three years \nago she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, \nand around six months later attempted to  \ntake her own life. You\u2019re never prepared to go \nthrough something like that. I\u2019ve been able to \nconnect with the Southwest Ohio chapter of the \nNational Alliance for Mental Illness. Along with \nmy daughter, we\u2019ve been able to share our story, \nparticipate in fundraising events, and connect \nwith other families that need that support. I \nthink that working somewhere where you have \nthat greater purpose provides a depth to what \nyou do.\u201d \n\u2013 Accountant at Alkermes\n \u201c I have a brother that suffered from opioid use \ndisorder for several years, and he\u2019s now been  \nin recovery for seven years. My motivation to \ncome into work each day is that I have seen  \nthat recovery is possible. I want to be a part of \nhelping at least one person, and hopefully many \nmore, in getting to that stage of recovery.\u201d \n\u2013 District Business Leader at Alkermes\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALKS_2019.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
