This risk assessment process helped us to recognize opportunities for improvement \nacross the enterprise, allowing us to realign corporate EHSS objectives and priorities and drive \nlocal strategies, goals, and objectives at the facility level. The Preventive EHSS Risk Model allows us \nto identify \u201cleading\u201d rather than \u201clagging\u201d indicators of risk and potentially avert those risks before \nthey impact the enterprise, and helps us uncover opportunities for continuous improvement.SECTION 4 \nENVIRONMENT\nAlkermes is committed to operating in a way that \nprotects our employees, our environment, and our \ncommunities.
