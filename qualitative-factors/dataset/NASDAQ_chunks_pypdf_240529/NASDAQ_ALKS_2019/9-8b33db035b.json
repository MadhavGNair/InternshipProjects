We implement this \ncommitment by integrating EHSS risk management \nrequirements throughout the lifecycle of each of \nour products. Our approach to product stewardship \noversight and control includes:\n\u2022  Generation of occupational and environmental \ntoxicology data, which is iterated and augmented  \nas each product progresses through its lifecycle;\n\u2022  Development and application of appropriate \noccupational health, safety, and environmental risk \ncontrols for each product based on scale, potency, \ntask, and other processing considerations; \n\u2022  Protocols and risk assessments to support safe and \nresponsible technology transfers within Alkermes \nor to external contract manufacturing organizations \n(CMOs) or contract research organizations (CROs);\n\u2022  Development of \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d processes \nto eliminate or reduce the use or generation of \nhazardous substances in the design and manufacture \nof our products; and \n\u2022  Implementation of a global program for process \nhazard management, with embedded controls as \nearly as the discovery stage of development and \nthrough full commercial-scale manufacturing.\nExternal Operations Risk Management \nWe have integrated certain EHSS risk management \nprocedures and the formal RMS framework into our \nvendor management and governance processes and \nwe collaborate directly with strategic partners to  \nfoster effective two-way risk management-focused \ncommunications. To ensure that our vendors operate  \nto Alkermes\u2019 standards, EHSS risk considerations are \nembedded into our due diligence assessments,  \non-boarding procedures, technology transfers, and \nroutine business reviews. We have also incorporated \nenhanced EHSS provisions into our standard service-\nlevel agreements related to our products.\nOur vendor assessment tools, which we developed \nbased on the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative\u2019s \n\u2018Pharmaceutical Industry Principles for Responsible \nSupply Chain Management,\u2019 address key areas such  as: EHSS management systems; performance and \nregulatory compliance; environmental sustainability; \noccupational health and safety systems; process safety \nmanagement controls; physical security; labor and \nethics policies; business continuity systems; and \ncapability to safely handle Alkermes products.\nWe have conducted on-site audits or desk-top reviews \nto assess all external CMOs directly involved in the \nmanufacture or packaging of proprietary Alkermes \nproducts, and use the information gained from these \nassessments to help us prioritize areas of focus for our \nongoing risk management efforts. \nEnvironmental Protection  \nand Sustainability \nWe intend to continue to grow our business and \noperations in a manner that is both protective of the \nenvironment and sustainable in the long-term. We \nstrive to create a culture of sustainability throughout \nour organization and work collaboratively across internal \nstakeholder groups and business units to identify ways \nto reduce our environmental impact, mitigate risks,  \nand create sustainable business opportunities. \nFor example, to increase sustainability awareness and \nemployee engagement, cross-functional teams at our \nAthlone site evaluated and prioritized ideas for how  \nwe might reduce our carbon footprint. This resulted  \nin the identification of key priorities and their \nincorporation into the facility\u2019s strategic sustainability \nplan. These priorities include: \n\u2022  Energy and resource conservation (including \nrenewable energy); \n\u2022 Behavior and communications;\n\u2022 Systems/projects and capital expenditure; and \n\u2022 Waste and recycling. \nCross-functional teams of employees at our other \nfacilities are similarly focusing on sustainability \ninitiatives such as waste stream evaluation and \noptimization. In later pages we highlight examples of \nother sustainability initiatives from across our enterprise.\nWe have also created a forum of engineering leaders \nfrom each of our sites to develop best practices for our SECTION 4 \nENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALKS_2019.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
