Twenty EBRGs across 1 04 local chapters appeal to \na wide variety of backgrounds and affiliations, including race, \nreligion, culture, age and personal interest. Membership \nincreased in 201 6 to 9,1 87 team members who are engaged \nin one or more of our EBRGs. Together, they contributed \n37 ,000 volunteer hours during EBRG service activities. In 2016, \nour EBRGs also expanded internationally, adding three new \nchapters in Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom. \nEBRGs submit annual business plans to demonstrate how their mission and efforts are staying \nconnected to our business.
