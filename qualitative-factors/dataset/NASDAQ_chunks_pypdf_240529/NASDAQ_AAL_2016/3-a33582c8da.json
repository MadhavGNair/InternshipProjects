{"page_content": "4Becoming the Greatest  \nAirline in the World\nWe are incredibly proud to be named the 2017 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World. \nDue to the tremendous efforts of our 120,000 team members, we accomplished key \nintegration milestones with no disruption to our service. Chief among these efforts was \nthe herculean task of integrating our Flight Operating System.\nINTEGRATING OUR FLIGHT OPERATING SYSTEM \nThe Flight Operating System (FOS) is the IT hub of the American Airlines operation. It\u2019s not a single \nprogram but rather a complex system behind which more than 500 independent applications run. These \napplications control the movement of more than 1,600 mainline and regional aircraft, the scheduling of \n37,000 crew members and other operational needs. In 2015, we operated two systems: one each for our \nlegacy American and US Airways fleets.\nIn 2016, we integrated our FOS systems, an action that will yield long-term benefits for both our \ncustomers and team members. In preparation for FOS cutover, a team of workgroup leaders and IT \npartners worked for almost a year to ensure programs and systems would operate uninterrupted. \nWe conducted extensive testing, with teams spending the equivalent of 150 years in training. On the actual \ncutover weekend in early October 2016, hundreds of American\u2019s team members staffed the main command \ncenter and several sub-command centers. Our team was on duty 24/7, but went home early on Sunday \nevening because things were going so well. \nWith FOS integration complete, American\u2019s fleets and pilot groups became one \u2014 the biggest such integration \nin airline history \u2014 all without a single cutover-related delay or disruption in service.\n15,000+\n hours spent by ambassadors \nassisting more than 90% of \nactive legacy US Airways \npilots prior to cutover150 Years\u2019 \nWorth of Training85,000 \nEmployees Impacted500+\n Applications \nA\ufb00ected\n(when actual changes \ntook place)243 \nGo-Live \nDates\n55,000+ \nhours dedicated to making \nsure legacy US Airways \npilots were prepared24 \nDepartments\n with Changes 18Command Centers \noperated 24/7   \n15,000+\n hours spent by ambassadors \nassisting more than 90% of \nactive legacy US Airways \npilots prior to cutover150 Years\u2019 \nWorth of Training85,000 \nEmployees Impacted500+\n Applications \nA\ufb00ected\n(when actual changes \ntook place)243 \nGo-Live \nDates\n55,000+ \nhours dedicated to making \nsure legacy US Airways \npilots were prepared24 \nDepartments\n with Changes 18Command Centers \noperated 24/7   \n15,000+\n hours spent by ambassadors \nassisting more than 90% of \nactive legacy US Airways \npilots prior to cutover150 Years\u2019 \nWorth of Training85,000 \nEmployees Impacted500+\n Applications \nA\ufb00ected\n(when actual changes \ntook place)243 \nGo-Live \nDates\n55,000+ \nhours dedicated to making \nsure legacy US Airways \npilots were prepared24 \nDepartments\n with Changes 18Command Centers \noperated 24/7   \n15,000+\n hours spent by ambassadors \nassisting more than 90% of \nactive legacy US Airways \npilots prior to cutover150 Years\u2019 \nWorth of Training85,000 \nEmployees Impacted500+\n Applications \nA\ufb00ected\n(when actual changes \ntook place)243 \nGo-Live Dates\n55,000+ \nhours dedicated to making \nsure legacy US Airways \npilots were prepared24 \nDepartments\n with Changes 18Command Centers \noperated 24/7   Employees standing by to address any issues during FOS cutover weekend.\nBY INTEGRATING OUR FOS SYSTEM, WE HAVE : \n4 Made it possible to manage the airline from a \nsingle set of systems at our Integrated Operations \nCenter (IOC) and reduced the overall complexity of \nour operations\n4 Created a single pilot workforce\n4 Optimized our network and fleet\n4 Facilitated quicker recovery after weather or other \ndisruptions to operations, helping customers get to \ntheir destinations fasterBY THE NUMBERS  \nFOS Cutover\nDespite it being the largest,  \nmost complex airline merger in \nhistory \u2026 The creation of the \u201cnew \nAmerican\u201d has been a remarkable \njourney for employees, customers \nand investors.\n\u2014 Air Transport World", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2016.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
