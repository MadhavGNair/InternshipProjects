{"page_content": "Applied Materials CSR Report 201715SUPPLIER DIVERSITY\nWe value global diversity in our supply chain and are committed to selecting diverse suppliers whose products and services \nmeet our supplier selection criteria and enable us to meet customer requirements. In 2017, we established a supplier diversity \nprogram to enhance the role diversity plays in our supplier selection process. \nCONFLICT MINERALS \nWe are committed to the responsible sourcing of materials used in our products. The equipment and many of the spare parts \nwe produce include components that contain tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold\u2014commonly labeled today as \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d \nWe do not directly purchase these minerals, nor do we have any direct relationship with mines or smelters that process these \nminerals. \nOur products, due to their size and complexity, generally consist of thousands of parts sourced from a multitude of suppliers. \nWe rely on our direct suppliers to provide information on the origin of any conflict minerals contained in parts sold to us, \nincluding conflict minerals they obtain from lower-tier suppliers and smelters.\nWe surveyed the direct suppliers responsible for approximately 80% of our total supply expenditures in fiscal 2017. Of these, \n39% reported that the parts they provided did not contain conflict minerals. Approximately 20% of those reporting parts \ncontaining conflict minerals declared that at least some minerals originated from recycled or scrap sources. \nOur approach to verifying the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals in our supply chain is designed to conform in all \nmaterial respects with OECD Guidance. Along with other RBA members, we have been a partner in the Responsible Minerals \nInitiative (RMI)\u2014an industrywide project to understand and determine how best to mitigate the complex issue of conflict \nminerals\u2014since its inception, when it was known as the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative. \nWe support refinement and expansion of RMI\u2019s list of Conformant Smelters through measures including RMI\u2019s Responsible \nMinerals Assurance Process, which uses independent third-party audits to identify smelters with systems in place to ensure \nthey procure responsibly sourced minerals. More information on our due diligence efforts is available through our website and in \nour most recent Conflict Minerals Report, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 29, 2018. \nABOUT CONFLICT MINERALS\nThe most commonly mined conflict minerals include tin, \ntantalum, tungsten and gold. They may originate in the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo or an adjacent country, where \nvarious armies and rebel groups have profited from mining while \ncontributing to violence and exploitation across the regions.\nThese minerals are used in a wide variety of electronics \nproducts such as smartphones and computers.\n79\nAu\nGold50\nW\nT ungsten73\nTa\nT antalum74\nSn\nTin", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2017.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
