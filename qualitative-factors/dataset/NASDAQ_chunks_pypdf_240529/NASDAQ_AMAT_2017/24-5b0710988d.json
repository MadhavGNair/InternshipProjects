Throughout the weeklong event, key executives reinforce the importance of ethics, integrity and legal \ncompliance, and each employee is reminded of specific policies and support available. \nThe Ethics and Compliance team also holds informal events, dubbed Ethics roadshows, at all major global locations on a two-\nyear rotation. T o further gauge awareness and obtain feedback from our workforce, we conduct an Ethics Survey every two \nyears. The next survey will be held in 2018. \nBUSINESS ETHICS HELPLINES\nWe maintain a toll-free Ethics Helpline and an online help form that are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, globally. \nThese resources are confidentially administered by Navex Global.
