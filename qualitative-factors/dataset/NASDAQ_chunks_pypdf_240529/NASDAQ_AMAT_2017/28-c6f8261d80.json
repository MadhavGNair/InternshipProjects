In 1994, the Applied Materials Foundation was established to \nensure that we maintain our commitment to the community during both economically prosperous and fiscally challenging \ntimes. Funding guidelines for the Foundation, including the grant application and details on review timing, are available online. \nEMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\nOur employees increase Applied\u2019s positive impact in the local community with personal donations and volunteer activities, \noften through company-initiated events that connect them with local nonprofit organizations. \nWe invite our employees around the world to maximize their personal contributions to charity by taking part in our Matching \nGift and Volunteer Time Grant programs. The Foundation matches employee contributions to eligible charities and educational \nprograms dollar-for-dollar, up to a $3,000 annual limit per employee\u2014which we increased in 2017 from a previous cap of \n$2,000. The Foundation also donates to an employee\u2019s charity of choice based on time spent volunteering with approved \nnonprofit organizations. \nIn 2017, matching gifts and volunteer time grants from the Foundation totaled $2.9 million\u2014helping our employees\u2019 generosity \nmake an even larger impact. \nAs part of our Applied 50th Anniversary festivities, we \ncelebrated our history of philanthropy by inviting each \nemployee, worldwide, to direct $50 from the Company to one \nof several charities.
