All laboratory animals used \nunder our responsibility must be treated humanely \nand with respect, and only purpose-bred animals are \nused. Zealand adheres to the principles of the 3Rs \n(reduce, refine, replace) and works to integrate these \nprinciples in all studies carried out, wherever possible.All in-house animal studies are carried out in accord-\nance with specific licenses issued by the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Food of Denmark and international \nguidelines, as appropriate. Danish law stipulates regu-\nlar inspections of the animal facilities as well as com-\nprehensive reporting protocols overseeing experi-\nments conducted during the year, processed through \nThe Animal Experiments Inspectorate. The continu-\nous dialogue between lab technicians, veterinarians, \nacademic staff and heads of department, ultimately \nensures the highest animal welfare standards in all \nstudies conducted.\nAll employees working with laboratory animals have \nappropriate and documented education and training. Veterinary checks of our animals are performed regu-\nlarly and always when needed.\nIn addition, Zealand\u2019s internal ethical committee scru-\ntinizes all proposed in-house in vivo pharmacology, \ntoxicology and PK experiments for compliance with \nregulatory permissions and highest ethical standards.\nThe necessity of animal experiments to Zealand\u2019s \nresearch and development activities cannot be over -\nstated, and thus we constantly strive for the greatest \nvigilance and care in our treatment of animals.15\nZealand Pharma \u221e Corporate Responsibility Report 2020", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2020.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
