AFRA = Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association.\nPAGE 20: EFFICIENT AERCAP OPERATIONS\n1. Renewable electricity usage available for offices representing ~77% of all permanent employees; where breakdown is unavailable, we assume zero renewable energy.\n2. Representing 67% of all permanent employees. \n3. Total waste generated includes an estimate for locations where data is not available based on headcount of permanent \nemployees and/or size, representing 28% of the total waste generated. Total waste breakdown estimate: Dry mixed \nrecycling (~25 tonnes), mixed general waste (~30 tonnes), food brown bin waste (~20 tonnes) and glass waste (~2 tonnes)\n4. Total water usage includes an estimate for locations where data is not available based on headcount of permanent \nemployees and/or size, representing 18% of the total water usage. \nPAGE 22: CARBON EMISSIONS DISCLOSURES\n1. Location- based. Emissions calculated using DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors 2022; CO2e includes CO2, CH4 and N2O. \nTotal includes an estimate for locations where data is not available based on headcount of permanent employees and/or size, representing ~31% of the total emissions generated by gas. Assumes 1000kg in 1 tonne. \n2. Please note, gas was incorrectly allocated to Scope 2 emissions in 2021, this has been amended in this report. \n3. Location- based. Emissions calculated using DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors 2022; CO2e includes CO2, CH4 and N2O. \nTotal includes an estimate for locations where data is not available based on headcount of permanent employees \nand/or size, representing ~4% of the total emissions generated by purchased electricity.
