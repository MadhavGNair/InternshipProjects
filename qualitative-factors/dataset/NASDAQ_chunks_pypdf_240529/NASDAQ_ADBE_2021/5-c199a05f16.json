{"page_content": "6\n2021 Adobe Corporate Social Responsibility ReportSpotlight:  Equity and Advancement Initiative\nIn the last year, we\u2019ve focused on protecting and advancing equal access to \nopportunities for historically marginalized and underrepresented groups.  \nWe\u2019ve also begun evolving the way we fund and engage  \nwith nonprofit organizations that align with these goals, \nbecause we\u2019re committed to creating a greater impact  \nwhile supporting the learning and development of both  \nthe nonprofits\u2019 leaders and our own employees. This is  \nan opportunity to integrate grantmaking with corporate programs and employee involvement for larger impact. As a first step, with financial support from the Adobe Foundation, we launched a 3-year Equity and Advancement  \nInitiative  with 11 leading Non-Governmental Organizations \n(NGOs). The initiative seeks to address systemic barriers to opportunity and advance social equity . Through this model, the Adobe Foundation and the company are making long-term, strategic commitments  \nand donating a minimum of US$20 million USD over  \n3 years to provide meaningful partnership opportunities, learning experiences for employees, and new ways of leveraging our unique strengths in support of issues  \nkey to Adobe and our communities . \nWe're excited by the opportunity to think \ndifferently about grantmaking, discover  \nnew approaches to partnering, and elevate diverse new voices in the fight for equality.\nArtwork by Kirsten Ulve\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADBE_2021.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
