{"page_content": "Replacing Traditional and \t\nLess Sustainable Ingredients\nWe use sugarcane, a rapidly renewable crop, \nas feedstock for the molecules we produce. \nThe sugarcane is sourced through growers \nin Brazil practicing sustainable production \nmethods. In 2020, Amyris received the Bonsucro \nChain of Custody Certification which ensures \nthat the Brazilian sugarcane used to develop \nour ingredients is sustainably produced and \nprocessed (see Chapter 2). \nThe specialty ingredients we create replace \ntraditional ingredients often derived from \nvulnerable species of plants and animals, \nor from petrochemicals that are harmful to \nthe environment. Two of our most popular \ningredients are squalane, found in our Clean \nBeauty products, and Reb M zero-calorie \nsweetener. Squalane is an ingredient widely used in many \ntypes of beauty and personal care products \nand is traditionally sourced from sharks or olive \ntrees. Amyris has developed squalane derived \nfrom sugarcane, which offers a sustainable, \nstable, highly scalable and affordable alternative \nto traditional sources. This exceptionally \nmoisturizing ingredient features prominently \nin Biossance and Pipette products and is also \nmarketed under the Neossance\u00ae Squalane brand \nto supply many of the world\u2019s leading beauty and \npersonal care brands. By replacing shark-derived \ningredients with our sugarcane-derived squalane, \nAmyris estimates that we offset the killing of over \nsix million sharks per year.\n12Amyris\u2019 sugarcane-derived \nsqualane is a USDA-certified \nbiobased product and an \nECOCERT-certified raw material, \nwhich demonstrates sustainability \nand transparency through the \nmanufacturing process.\n12\nProtecting People and the Planet 1\n 2\n 3\nSQUALANE: SUPERIOR MOISTURIZER AND CARRIER\nLess than 0.1% hectare  \nof sugarcane \n(size of an 8x10 rug)Three sharks killed \n(depending on size of species)One kg of \t\nSqualane\n2020 Inaugural ESG Report\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2020.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
