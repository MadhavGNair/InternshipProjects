{"page_content": "Working to Fight Infectious Diseases\nAmyris was founded in 2003 by a group of \nscientists from the University of California, \nBerkeley. In 2004, through a grant from the \nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we developed \ntechnology to create microbial yeast strains \nthat produce artemisinic acid, a precursor of \nartemisinin used in artemisinin combination \ntherapies (ACT) to treat malaria. This technology \nwas licensed to Sanofi on a royalty-free basis and \napproximately 120 million ACT treatments were \ndelivered to help fight malaria worldwide. We are \ncontinuing to work with the Gates Foundation to \ndevelop additional yeast strains that produce \nACT treatments at a low cost. \nOur work on combating infectious diseases \ncontinued in 2020 with the signing of a \ncollaborative agreement and exclusive license \nwith the Infectious Disease Research Institute \n(IDRI), a medical research organization, to \nadvance a novel ribonucleic acid (RNA) vaccine \nplatform for use in future vaccines for COVID-19 \nand certain other viruses. Pre-clinical studies \nof the Amyris/IDRI RNA vaccine platform have \nbeen promising and the project is expected to \nmove to Phase 1 clinical trials. The Amyris/IDRI \nplatform is expected to offer manufacturing, storage, and distribution advantages for the \nuse and development of future vaccines. The \nAmyris/IDRI platform\u2019s manufacturing process \nis designed with a well-established oil-in-water \nemulsion technology that is already used in \ncommercialized vaccines. In addition, the use \nof the Amyris/IDRI RNA platform would result \nin a vaccine that can be stored for a protracted \nperiod at refrigerator temperatures and for \nseveral months at room temperature, increasing \nthe potential to significantly improve distribution \nof pandemic response vaccines in low-resource \nsettings.\nThe work on the RNA vaccine platform builds on \nanother collaboration between Amyris and IDRI \nunder a $4.4 million, five-year grant received by \nIDRI in 2019 from the National Institute of Allergy \nand Infectious Diseases (part of the U.S. National \nInstitutes of Health) to develop sustainable \nalternatives to shark squalene for use in vaccine \nadjuvants. Squalene is an important component \nin many adjuvants, which help boost the efficacy \nof vaccines. Amyris has produced highly effective \nsqualene from sugarcane as a replacement for \nshark-derived squalene, offering a sustainable, \naffordable and rapidly scalable alternative that \noffsets the killing of sharks and supports ocean \nbiodiversity.\nMaking Life Better 1\n 2\n 3\nGRANT AND PARTNERSHIPS\n442020 Inaugural ESG Report\nWe developed technology to \ncreate microbial yeast strains \nthat produce artemisinic acid, a \nprecursor of artemisinin used in \nartemisinin combination therapies \n(ACT) to treat malaria.We signed a collaborative \nagreement and exclusive license \nwith IDRI to advance a novel \nribonucleic acid (RNA) vaccine \nplatform for use in future vaccines \nfor COVID-19 and other viruses.Through IDRI, we worked with The \nNational Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases (part of the U.S. \nNational Institutes of Health) to develop \nsustainable alternatives to shark squalene \nfor use in vaccine adjuvants.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2020.pdf", "page": 43, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
