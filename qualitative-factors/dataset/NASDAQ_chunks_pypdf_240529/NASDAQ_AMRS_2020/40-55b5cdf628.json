{"page_content": "Helping Protect Communities \t\nDuring the Pandemic\nIn early 2020, Amyris launched a new Pipette \nbrand hand sanitizer on an accelerated schedule \nas part of our efforts to help fight the COVID-19 \npandemic. Following the product launch, Amyris \ndonated over 21,000 32-ounce-size units to \nfront line health care workers at hospitals and \norganizations throughout California and New \nYork. Amyris also donated hand sanitizer to \nBloom Energy, a company that refurbishes \ncritically needed hospital ventilators.\nOur Purecane brand launched a campaign in \nMay 2020 to support Feeding America, an \norganization committed to serving communities \nand individuals facing hunger across the US. \nPurecane customers were able to round up the \namount of their online purchases, which were \ndonated to Feeding America and helped provide \nmeals to 4,000 families struggling as a result of \nthe pandemic.\nOur Biossance brand raised funds to support \nDirect Relief, an organization that works in the \nU.S. and internationally to equip doctors and \nnurses with lifesaving medical resources. 100% \nof online sales on April 16 were donated to \nDirect Relief, totaling $120,000, and from April \n17 through May 31, online customers were able \nto round up the total of their purchases to be \ndonated to the organization.Volunteering our Time to \t\nAssist Communities\nDespite challenges related to the COVID-19 \npandemic that prevented Amyris from safely \nholding our annual Volunteer Week and other \nin-person volunteer events, our purpose-driven \nemployees continued to provide community \nassistance where we could. In addition to \ndonating Pipette hand sanitizer, Amyris also \nhosted a Fall Backpack Drive, raising over \n$3,800, as well as our annual holiday drive \nwith the Family Giving Tree, which resulted \nin donations of over $2,700. We donated \nbulk snacks and Pipette hand sanitizer to The \nEast Oakland Collective, a community-based \norganization dedicated to racial equality, \neconomic empowerment, and solutions to \nhomelessness. Our employees also volunteered \ntheir time to STEM education, which was held \nvirtually in 2020. In 2019, over 100 employees \nvolunteered 2,045 hours at food banks, animal \nshelters, educational institutions and blood \ndrives. We look forward to continuing these in-\nperson efforts in the post-pandemic world.\nHiring in our Communities\nAmyris strives to have a positive economic \nimpact in our local communities.
