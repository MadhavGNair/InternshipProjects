The focus of this \nnew plant will be the manufacture of several \nmolecules, including Reb M zero-calorie \nsweetener. This partnership with Ra\u00edzen will \nutilize sustainable production practices, \nincluding the use of co-generation systems \nto supply energy. Bagasse, a by-product of \nconverting sugarcane into sugar, is used by \nRa\u00edzen in their co-generation systems at Barra \nBonita to produce energy to power the plant \nduring sugarcane growing season. By building \nour production plant next to Ra\u00edzen\u2019s sugar \nmill, we will also reduce carbon emissions by \neliminating the need for any transport of the \nfeedstock by truck. \nWe also have a joint venture with Nikkol Group \ncalled Aprinnova with global distribution \ncapability for our sugarcane-derived squalane \ningredient that we make at our Leland, \nNorth Carolina manufacturing facility for our \nown clean beauty brands and for other top \nglobal beauty brands. The Leland facility has \nimplemented process improvements to increase \nour energy efficiency, including consolidating production steps and retrofitting equipment, \nsuch as replacing older glass-lined vessels with \nstainless steel. This plant is considered a small \nquantity emitter and in spite of productivity \nincreases, emissions have remained very low. \nAmyris is committed to reducing the environmental \nimpact of our product distribution. Our Supply \nChain has taken action to shorten transit routes \nand reduce cold storage transport. In addition, \nall of our direct-to-consumer order shipments \nfor our Biossance, Pipette and Purecane brands \nare carbon neutral. In 2020, we partnered \nwith Carbonfund, a non-profit organization, to \npurchase carbon credits, offsetting approximately \n30 metric tons of carbon emissions from \n147,403 customer orders traveling an average of \n180,763,095 air and ground miles. Our purchase \nof carbon offset credits supports forest \nconservation initiatives.\nProtecting People and the Planet 1\n 2\n 3\nPROUD \nPARTNER:\nJOINT VENTURE:\n20\n2020 Inaugural ESG Report\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2020.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
