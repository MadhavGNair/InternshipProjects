As part of this work, \nAmyris retained the Governance & Accountability \nInstitute (G&A), a highly respected advisor on \nESG issues, to perform an independent third-\nparty assessment.\nThe assessment began by examining a range of \nkey stakeholders, including investors, customers, \nemployees and ESG rating organizations, as \nwell as studying industry peers, to conduct \na materiality analysis for ESG topics. Topics \nincluded each of the Global Reporting Initiative \n(GRI) Standards Topics, the 17 United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the \nSustainability Accounting Standards Board \n(SASB) - Chemicals Sustainability Accounting \nStandard, and other ESG topics of interest to \ninvestors and other important stakeholders.\nWe first mapped sector-specific material ESG \ntopics identified by these stakeholders to the \nGRI Standards Topics. For material ESG topics \nidentified that did not map directly to a GRI \nStandards Topic, an additional \u201cNon-GRI Material \nTopic\u201d was added to the materiality analysis and \nincluded in the GRI content index. This initial \nstep produced a list of 37 topics of interest to \ndifferent groups of stakeholders.\nWe then conducted a deeper analysis to \nprioritize these issues starting with an \nassessment of a selection of highly rated ESG \nindustry peers and clients. We also examined the \nmethodologies of leading ESG investor raters \nand institutional investors. We reviewed their \nstrategic selection of material ESG topics for \ninclusion in their sustainability disclosure, rating \nmethodologies, investment decision-making,  \ngoal setting and strategy. From this research, G&A calculated an overall \nmateriality score for each ESG topic to help  \nfocus our strategy and disclosures in this report. \nUsing this quantitative model, Amyris identified \nthe highest scoring topics as most material to  \nthe business. \nInnovation\nCollaboration\nAmyrous\nSafety\nIntegrityCORE VALUES\nWe continuously solve unsolved needs.
