{"page_content": "Conserving Water and Reducing \t\nUse of Harmful Chemicals\nThe sugarcane sourced by Amyris is a fast-\ngrowing, rapidly renewable crop that requires \nminimal irrigation due to abundant rainfall in \nBrazil. To prepare for the possibility of droughts, \nour growers in Brazil also have numerous \nwater-saving measures in place, including \npreemptively collecting and storing rainwater \nand reclaiming wastewater. As often as possible, \nwe reuse and recycle by-products from our \nsugarcane processing. For example, we make \nour ingredient Biosilica\u2122, an alternative to silica \nwhich is widely used in the cosmetic industry, \nfrom sugarcane ash. \nRa\u00edzen, our sugarcane manufacturing partner \nin Brazil, has been a leader in sustainable \nfarming practices that have reduced the amount \nof pesticides and chemical fertilizers. These \npractices include replacement of traditional \npesticides with bio-pesticides and the \nrepurposing of vinasse, a by-product of yeast \nfermentation, for use as fertilizer. \nIn addition, Bonsucro certification ensures \nenvironmental safety standards for use \nof agrochemicals including fertilizers and \npesticides. These standards also restrict the use \nof active ingredients banned by the Stockholm \nand Rotterdam Conventions, the Montreal \nProtocol, and World Health Organization as well \nas other health organizations. \nReducing Waste in our Operations \t\nand Packaging\nThe sustainability of our products is central to \nthe mission of Amyris and, in addition to using \nrenewable ingredients, we are committed to \nusing recyclable materials in product packaging. Our consumer brands, including Biossance and \nPipette, have worked to replace non-recyclable \nmaterials used in bottles, tubes, caps and other \npackaging with recyclable materials including \nPCR plastics and bottles manufactured using \nsugarcane ethanol instead of petroleum derived \nenergy sources. The outer boxes for many \nBiossance, Pipette and Purecane products are \nmade from tree-free sugarcane pulp, a by-\nproduct of sugarcane processing.\nThe ingredients we develop are shipped in \nrecyclable totes, jerricans and drums. For \nshipments of key intermediates, we have \nimplemented the use of flexitanks, which are \nrecycled after use and have negated the need \nfor cold shipments. \nOur laboratory facilities in Emeryville, California \nand our Aprinnova manufacturing plant in \nLeland, North Carolina have implemented \nprograms to sort non-hazardous waste streams \nand promote employee awareness of recycling \nstreams. In Emeryville, we seek to recycle all \nplastic lab disposable equipment that is free \nfrom hazardous chemicals. Over 90% of the \nhazardous waste produced in our Emeryville \nlaboratory facilities is recycled or burned \nto produce energy, meeting our 2020 goal of \ndiverting more than 90% of lab waste from \nlandfill. All non-hazardous lab solid waste is \nburned to produce energy, and hazardous liquid \nwaste is recycled or burned for energy. Any \nliquid waste from our fermentation process \nis repurposed for dust control at our waste \nmanagement partner in Albuquerque. \nWe are also evaluating the potential repurposing \nof heavy oil residues from distillation for use \nin our boilers during off season. Overall, our \nmanufacturing process generates very low \namounts of other waste, hazardous or non-\nhazardous. \nAt our Leland plant in 2020, we recycled over \n300 metric tons of isopropyl alcohol (IPA), a by-\nproduct of our squalane manufacturing process, \nand shipped an additional 60 metric tons of \nIPA to companies that reuse the chemical in \nproducts such as window cleaner.

This resulted in a reduction of \n40,000 miles driven and over 2,600 \nmetric tons CO2e avoided.\n2020 Inaugural ESG Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2020.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
