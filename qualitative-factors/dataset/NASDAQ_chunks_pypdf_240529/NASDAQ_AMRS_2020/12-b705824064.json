{"page_content": "Reb M (Rebaudioside M) is a molecule found \nnaturally in the leaves of the stevia plant. Using \nour advanced technology platform, we produce \nour Reb M molecule from fermentation.\nReb M from the stevia plant is naturally present \nin low concentrations (less than 0.1%) in the plant \nand is difficult to extract through conventional \nharvesting. Our Reb M from fermentation has \na taste profile similar to sugar and does not \nhave the bitter aftertaste commonly associated \nwith stevia. Because of the rarity of the Reb M \nmolecule, we estimate that the manufacturing \nprocess to create our Reb M from fermentation \nrequires 1/8 of the agricultural acreage compared \nto other leaf extraction methods.\nOur Reb M is commercialized as an ingredient \nfor multiple applications where there is a \ndesire to replace sugar or other high-potency \nsweeteners in beverages, dairy products, baked \ngoods, condiments and confections on the \nmarket. In addition, it can be found in our zero-\ncalorie consumer brand, Purecane.Ensuring the Safety of Ingredients \t\nand Products\nAmyris is committed to developing and \nproducing high-performing, low-cost ingredients \nand products made using sustainable raw \nmaterials. That\u2019s our No Compromise\u00ae principle. \nWe work to exceed government regulations and \nindustry codes for the safety of ingredients and \nseek third-party validation and certifications to \ndemonstrate our commitment. \nOur Reb M based sweetener is produced using \nonly yeast and Brazilian sugarcane, which is \nBonsucro certified for sustainable and ethical \nproduction (see Chapter 2). We use Reb M \nas the hero ingredient in Purecane sweetener \nproducts, which are non-GMO, Halal, Kosher and \ndesignated with the Generally Recognized as \nSafe (GRAS) notification from the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA).\n13\nProtecting People and the Planet 1\n 2\n 3\nReb M (Rebaudioside M) is a \nmolecule found naturally in the \nleaves of the stevia plant.
