In early 2020, we began closely \nmonitoring the global COVID-19 pandemic and its \nimpact on all aspects of our business, including \nour employees, partners, supply chain and \ndistribution network. As an essential business, \nwe developed a comprehensive COVID-19 \nresponse strategy including the establishment \nof a cross-functional COVID-19 task force and \nimplementation of safety protocols to ensure \ncontinuity of our essential operations. Our safety \nprotocols were focused on strategies to prevent \nthe spread of COVID-19 using science based \nrecommendations from state and federal public \nhealth experts, with the highest priority being \nthe health and welfare of our employees and \ncommunity.\nWe initiated procedures including additional \nsanitation and cleaning protocols in our \nlaboratories and other facilities, on-site COVID-19 \ntesting, temperature and symptom confirmations, \nimplementation of social distancing and \nstaggered work schedules for our employees \nwho were required to work on-site. For \nemployees who were able to work remotely, we \nrolled out new technologies and collaboration \ntools as well as financial support for ergonomic \nworkstations at home.\nAmyris successfully managed to sustain ongoing \nlaboratory work, product development and \ndistribution, including no employee layoffs or \nfurloughs, while staying in compliance with \npublic health orders.
