{"page_content": "Producing Highly Pure Molecules \t\nwith Clean Chemistry\nUsing our proprietary Lab-to-Market operating \nsystem for clean chemistry, Amyris engineers \nthe genetics of yeast strains and then ferments \nthe yeast in sugarcane syrup to convert basic \nplant sugars into molecules that can be used \nas clean, sustainable ingredients for consumer \nproducts. We continue to improve our Lab-to-\nMarket speed to identify and commercialize new \nmolecules; our first commercial ingredient took \nabout 40 months from yeast strain to pilot plant \nrun, and today we average less than 12 months. \nThis has resulted in a 90 percent reduction in \nthe cost of product development and an 80 \npercent reduction in time-to-market for new \nproducts. \nBy the end of 2020, Amyris had commercialized \n13 molecules, with 18 additional molecules \nin active development and 10 more in the discovery phase. We expect to add at least \neight new molecules to our active development \npipeline in 2021. The molecules and ingredients \nwe develop serve as the foundation of our \nconsumer brands.\nThe three, Amyris-owned consumer brands all \ninclude products made with our sustainable \ningredients as building blocks \u2013 Biossance\u00ae \nclean beauty skincare, Pipette\u00ae clean baby \nskincare and Purecane\u2122, a zero-calorie \nsweetener naturally derived from sugarcane. \nTwo that we acquired in 2020 will convert \nto Amyris ingredients over time: Terasana\u00ae \nspecialty skincare and Costa Brazil\u2122 luxury \nskincare. Two new brands will launch in 2021 \nusing Amyris\u2019 hero ingredients: Rose, Inc.\u2122 color \ncosmetics and JVN\u2122 haircare.\n11\nProtecting People and the Planet 1\n 2\n 3\n2020 Inaugural ESG Report\nOUR SUSTAINABLE  \nCONSUMER BRANDS\nclean baby skincareclean beauty skincare\na zero-calorie sweetener \t\nnaturally derived from sugarcane", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2020.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
