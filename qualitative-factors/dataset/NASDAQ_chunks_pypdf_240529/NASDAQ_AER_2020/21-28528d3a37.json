We follow the definition of \u201cindependent\u201d according to the Dutch \nCorporate Governance Code and our Board has been majority -independent since our \nIPO in 2006.\nWith diversity in mind, we carefully select our non- executive directors based upon their \ncombined experience and expertise. The directors are appointed at the Annual General \nMeeting of the shareholders by a majority vote. Each director serves up to four years in a term. We believe this strikes the right balance of board stability while allowing for the introduction of regular fresh perspectives.\nAerCap\u2019s Board has direct influence on all material issues facing the company, such as \nsignificant transactions, funding and risk management, either via Board meetings /resolutions or through Board committees. On ESG issues, the AerCap Board exerts oversight and delegates implementation of these ESG strategies to our GEC. The Board was actively involved in monitoring our response to Covid- 19, and increased the \nregularity of meetings accordingly.\nUnder the Board\u2019s guidance, management has actively implemented our fleet strategy \nand has significantly reduced our overall carbon footprint. The extent of our fleet transformation has been one of our key competitive advantages. The positive impact of our proactive approach extends into a wide range of environmental, social and governance issues. This also translates positively into management assessment metrics and earnings- per-share (\u201cEPS\u201d) growth target, aligning management with \nshareholder interests and ESG factors.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AER_2020.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
