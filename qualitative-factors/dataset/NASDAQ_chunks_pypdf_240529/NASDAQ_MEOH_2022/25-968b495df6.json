{"page_content": "2. RELIABILITY \nTo reduce our emissions intensity, we focus on \nmaintaining a high level of reliability. Reliable plants \nrun continuously at full operating rates to optimize \nnatural gas efficiency and are critical to managing \nemissions. The safe start-up and shutdown of \nmethanol production facilities requires the flaring \nof some natural gas from the system, which results \nin increased emissions. We are tracking the impact \nof process decisions made during startups and \nshutdowns to identify process changes that can  \nhelp reduce emissions.\nTo keep our plants running continually and minimize \nunplanned shutdowns, we focus on preventive \nmaintenance, condition monitoring for critical assets, \nand risk-based inspection for static equipment. \nReliability measures the time a plant is in operation \nwithout unplanned shutdowns, excluding days lost \nfor business-related reasons (e.g., interruptions in \nutility supply or lack of feedstock). Our 2022 global \nplant reliability was 95.6\u00a0per cent, below our reliability \ntarget of 97.0\u00a0per\u00a0cent. Our manufacturing regions \nexperienced several outage events, including longer \nthan scheduled turnarounds, which collectively \nimpacted our overall reliability. Our four-year \nreliability average is 94.7\u00a0per\u00a0cent. The chemical reaction process to produce methanol \nrequires the use of catalysts. Catalysts degrade \nover time and, depending on the technology, need \nto be changed every three to six years. We replace \ncatalysts as part of our turnaround process. \nOur Medicine Hat facility is currently operating \nwith a new methanol synthesis catalyst from our \nsupplier Johnson Matthey. Its lower deactivation \nrate can improve overall efficiency, lower emissions \nand potentially optimize the timing of our plant \nturnaround cycles. The initial performance of the \nnew catalyst looks promising, and we are evaluating \nthe potential for application at other sites.3. REDUCED-INTENSITY GROWTH PROJECTS \nWe look for opportunities to simultaneously grow \nproduction and reduce CO\u2082 intensity by using our \nexisting assets in innovative ways. By using auto-\nthermal reforming (ATR) technology\u2014which has \nlower energy requirements resulting in less CO\u2082\u2014\nand injecting excess hydrogen from G1 and G2 \nsteam, our growth project in Geismar is expected \nto have one of the lowest CO\u2082 emissions intensity \nprofiles in the methanol industry. Once in operation, \nG3 will be capable of producing 1.8 million tonnes of \nmethanol annually. Budgeted at $1.25-1.30 billion, \nG3 is adjacent to our existing G1 and G2 plants with \nshared infrastructure that creates material capital \nand operating cost advantages. \nWe aim for our future growth \nprojects to contribute to our \nemission reduction goals. PERFORMANCE GOAL\nTarget 97 per cent or higher reliability of our \nexisting assets each year, which will maintain \nor decrease current GHG emissions.\n<0.40\ntonnes of \nCO\u2082/tonne  \nof methanol\nESTIMATED \nFOR G30.63\ntonnes of  \nCO\u2082/tonne  \nof methanol\nMETHANEX \nFIVE-YEAR \nAVERAGE \nINTENSITY< <3.2\ntonnes of \nCO\u2082/tonne  \nof methanol\nCOAL-BASED \nMETHANOL\nMethanex only \nuses natural gas as \na feedstock in our \nproduction facilities.\nConstruction on \nMethanex\u2019s G3 \nfacility continues \non schedule, with \nfirst production \nanticipated in Q4 \n2023.
