{"page_content": "As society and industry commit to decarbonization, \nthe world faces a dilemma: while demand for \npetrochemicals and global transportation of  \ngoods is growing, so are the pressures to reduce  \nor eliminate the GHG emissions from these  \nproducts and activities.\nMethanol can help resolve this dilemma. With wide \navailability around the world, methanol can help \nmeet the increased demand for petrochemicals-based \nproducts and reduce air pollution and GHG emissions \nfrom combustion-related fuel applications. Methanol \ncan also be made from renewable sources thereby \nsupporting the long-term decarbonization of the \ntransportation sector and the chemicals that make \nmodern life possible.\nHere are four key reasons why we believe  \nmethanol has an important role to play in the  \nlow-carbon economy.Methanol\u2019s Role in the Low-carbon Economy\nMETHANOL HAS MULTIPLE \nPATHWAYS AVAILABLE TO \nSUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO \nLOWER-CARBON METHANOL\nRenewable feedstocks, renewable \nenergy sources and new technologies \nto produce lower-carbon methanol \nare available and rapidly advancing. \nFor example, biomethanol can be \nproduced today from renewable \nnatural gas using existing assets, \nas we have proven at our Geismar \nlocation. Technologies to produce  \nblue and green methanol are evolving, \nwith carbon capture becoming \nincreasingly commercially viable and \nelectrolysis of water developing. METHANOL CAN LEVERAGE \nEXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE\nOne of the greatest challenges in \nachieving the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy is the massive \ninvestment required in new energy \ninfrastructure. Methanol can leverage \nexisting production facilities, as \nwell as storage and transportation \ninfrastructure. All of our existing \nproduction facilities can be used \nto manufacture biomethanol, and \nnew technologies could be used to \ngradually convert existing assets \nto produce methanol with a range \nof carbon intensities. Methanol is \nliquid at ambient temperature and \npressure, which allows it to make use \nof existing tankers, storage tanks and \npipelines around the world. Finally, \nengine designs require relatively minor \nmodifications to use methanol as fuel \nin cars, trucks, and ships, making a \ntransition to methanol relatively easy \nand more affordable.METHANOL CAN SUPPORT  \nTHE DECARBONIZATION OF  \nTHE SHIPPING INDUSTRY\nWhile shipping is the most energy-\nefficient way to carry cargo  \n(in terms of energy use per tonne-\nkilometre transported), it accounts \nfor 3 per cent of man-made CO\u2082 \nemissions. Transitioning maritime \nshipping to lower-carbon fuels \ncould have tremendous economic \nand environmental benefits. Using \nconventional methanol as a fuel \nsignificantly reduces air emissions \nsuch as SO\u00d7 , NO\u00d7 , and particulate \nmatter during combustion and \nreduces carbon emissions by up \nto 15\u00a0per cent from combustion \ncompared to other conventional \nfossil fuels. The use of biomethanol \nand e-methanol can be carbon \nneutral on a lifecycle basis, providing \na \u201cfuture-proof\u201d pathway to global \nand industry decarbonization goals.METHANOL CAN SUPPORT \nDECARBONIZATION PATHWAYS \nFOR OTHER COUNTRIES  \nAND INDUSTRIES\nNo matter how it is produced, \nmethanol is the same essential \nchemical building block. Therefore, \nblue or green methanol can be used in \nthe same applications, both chemical \nand fuel-related, and can be blended \ntogether with conventional methanol \nto lower emissions intensity. Along \nwith the availability of existing \ninfrastructure to transport methanol, \nthis capability makes methanol an \naccessible decarbonization pathway \nfor economies that are expected to \ntransition more slowly away from \nhigh-emissions energy sources for \nvehicle, heavy cargo, and even cooking \nfuels. Lower-carbon methanol can \nalso support decarbonization goals of \ndownstream chemical producers and \nhelp produce lower-carbon consumer \nand industrial products.\nCommitments About Methanex Inclusion & Community Integrity Low-carbon\u00a0Solutions People\u00a0&\u00a0Environment Transporting Methanol Appendices Methanex 2022 Sustainability Report13\nOur Contributions to the SDGs Our Approach to SustainabilityOur Approach\nOur Reporting Focus Areas\nMethanol\u2019s Role in the Low-carbon Economy\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2022.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
