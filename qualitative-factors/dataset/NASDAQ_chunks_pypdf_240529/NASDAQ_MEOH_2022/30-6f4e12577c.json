{"page_content": "Support for e-methanol technology developers \nIn 2013, Methanex made a pioneering investment \nin green e-methanol technology developer Carbon \nRecycling International (CRI) based in Iceland. The \nCRI demonstration plant was used to prove their \nemissions-to-liquids (ETL) technology, recycling CO\u2082 \nfrom a nearby geothermal power plant and using \nrenewable energy to produce renewable methanol. \nIn 2022, CRI reached a milestone with the start-\nup of the world\u2019s largest CO\u2082-to-methanol plant \nin Anyang, China based on CRI\u2019s ETL technology. \nMethanex increased its support for CRI in 2022, \nwith an increase in $1 million in equity, converted \nfrom a portion of a mezzanine loan, and an \nextension of the remaining mezzanine loan.\nPlanning for future-proof growth\nOur design team considers emissions-lowering \nfeatures when planning growth projects for the \nnear term. For example, by planning for carbon \ncapture when designing a growth project\u2014even if \nthe region does not yet have carbon storage capacity \nor infrastructure\u2014we are able to incorporate that \ntechnology more easily in the future should the \ninfrastructure become available.\nLooking further into the future, we are also \nconsidering design solutions that are many  \nyears away from being proven or implemented.  \nIn 2022, Methanex committed $1 million to support \ninternal research on design improvements that  \ncould potentially halve the carbon intensity of future \nplants compared with current best-in-class designs \nsuch as G3. We are continuing this research in 2023.THE \u201cGREEN PREMIUM\u201d CHALLENGE\n\u201cThe green premium\u201d refers to the gap between  \nthe cost to produce lower-carbon methanol and \nwhat customers are willing to pay for it. While \nwe are seeing the gap narrow, this remains a key \nchallenge to scaling production of blue or green \nmethanol. (See Figure 4). \nTeam members from across our business and  \naround the globe are working together to develop \nconcepts, test feasibility, and liaise between \ncustomers and suppliers. As markets and regulations \nshift and government incentives evolve, we are \ncontinually working to understand what solutions \nour customers want, gauge their willingness to pay \na premium for blue or green methanol, and facilitate \nthe supply needed to meet customer needs.\nFIGURE 4 \u2013 METHANOL PRICE RANGE REQUIRED TO  \nUNDERPIN INVESTMENT\nUSD $/tonne of methanol\nRange of current capital and production costs for different forms  \nof methanol.
