{"page_content": "Handling methanol safely is a critical element  \nof safe transport. Like many other chemicals and \nfuels, methanol can be toxic if swallowed, inhaled \nor absorbed by the skin. It is also flammable. \nAppropriate safety precautions must be taken  \nwhen using, handling or working around methanol  \nto keep people and the environment safe.\nOur product stewardship programs promote \nthe safe transport, storage, use and handling of \nmethanol through the entire product value chain, \nstarting with product safety programs for our team \nmembers and extending to the sharing of best \npractices with distributors, terminals, supply chain \npartners, customers and other key stakeholders. \nThrough our product safety practices and our \nparticipation in industry associations across regions, \nincluding the Methanol Institute and Chemistry \nIndustry Association of Canada, we provide \ninformation on managing the risks of methanol  \nand promote its proper use and safe handling. Supporting safe handling by workers \u2013 At our \nmanufacturing sites, methanol is stored in tanks \nand transported via pipelines into marine vessels or \nloaded into rail cars or trucks. For this reason, very \nfew workers have contact with methanol. The only \npeople who directly handle methanol are individuals \nwho conduct quality testing (e.g., in our labs) or \nother procedures. These individuals are required \nto undergo specialized training, wear adequate \npersonal protective equipment (PPE) and participate \nin industrial hygiene monitoring programs.\nTo ensure workers and handlers of methanol have \nthe information they need to stay safe and meet our \nhazard communication requirements, we provide \nSafety Data Sheets (SDSs), which are available in \n22\u00a0different languages and in two formats: Globally \nHarmonized System (GHS) for use around the globe, \nand Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and \nRestrictions of Chemicals (REACH) for countries in \nthe European Union (EU). SDSs provide information \non the hazards of methanol and contain advice \nabout safety precautions, including minimum PPE to \nrun facilities, undertake quality analysis, and provide \nemergency response. In 2022, we updated SDSs for \nour Latin America region (available in Spanish and \nEnglish) and revised and shared our REACH Safety \nData Sheets for our EU customers and logistic service \nproviders, in line with new revised requirements for \nEU Safety Data Sheets. We achieved 100% product \ncompliance with global and \nregional regulations in 2022.\nResponding to customer inquiries \u2013 Our regional \nteams deliver timely, high quality compliance \ndocuments to our customers.\nExternal training for a safe supply chain \u2013  \nWe regularly share best practices on methanol \nsafe handling and loading procedures. We offer \nmethanol-handling safety seminars, webinars and \nworkshops to stakeholders throughout our supply \nchain, including partners, customers, terminals, \nsurveyors, distributors, carriers, and emergency \nservice providers, as well as local and/or regional \nauthorities in all regions where we have sales \nactivities. In 2022, we held 30 safety webinars/\nseminars, reaching 193 organizations and more than \n900 people. Where possible under COVID-19 health \nand safety regulations, some events were held in \nperson, allowing for increased relationship building \nand site visits. We also provide technical and safety \ninformation about methanol in multiple languages \non our website, including material SDSs (as noted \nabove), a methanol safe handling guide and video.Working with safe distributors \u2013 Distributors \nhandle approximately 30 per cent of the methanol \nwe produce. In 2013, we developed a Distributor \nResponsible Care (RC) Standard defining the \nresponsible distribution principles, behaviours,  \nand practices we expect from our distributors.  \nThese include active and effective management \nplans for risk, communications, legal compliance, \nsub-distributor management, safe handling, \nemergency response, performance tracking, and \ncontinuous improvement. In 2022, we evaluated \nand ranked our distributors based on their risk \nprofile and their level of Distributor RC Standard \nimplementation. We will use the ranking in the \ncoming years to identify distributors for the \ndevelopment and execution of action plans \nfor improvement, as needed. We continue to \nregularly review, update and share the standard \nto help distributors align their handling practices \nwith Responsible Care and Methanex\u2019s product \nstewardship principles.\nWe assessed 100% of  \nour distributors against  \nour Distributor Responsible  \nCare Standard in 2022.Product SafetyPERFORMANCE GOAL\nReach at least 130 organizations through \nour product stewardship programs to \npromote the safe and sustainable handling \nand use of methanol.\u00a0\nOur Approach Commitments About Methanex Inclusion & Community Integrity Low-carbon\u00a0Solutions People\u00a0&\u00a0Environment Appendices Methanex 2022 Sustainability Report63\nTransportation Safety Ecological Impacts of ShippingTransporting Methanol\nProduct Safety\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2022.pdf", "page": 62, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
