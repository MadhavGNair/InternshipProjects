{"page_content": "10Risk management\nS& T has an Enterprise Risk \nManagement (ERM) program in place \nto identify, assess, measure, monitor , \nreport, and mitigate excessive risk \nacross our organization. While we \nrecognize that risk is an inevitable \npart of doing business, we need to \ndetermine how much risk we are willing \nto bear. We make decisions within the \ncontext of our risk appetite statement. \nOur board oversees the management \nof our risk-appetite statement to \noptimize long-term shareholder value \nwhile supporting our employees, \ncustomers, and communities. \nThe board\u2019s risk committee is \nresponsible for overseeing S&T\u2019s \nrisk management activities and the \neffectiveness of its ERM framework. \nAn example is monitoring our \ncompliance risk with respect to \nregulatory and legal matters and our \ncybersecurity program to protect our \nemployees, clients, communities, and \ninfrastructure. Our Enterprise Risk \nManagement Committee (ERMC) is \ncomprised of our executive leadership \nteam, and is responsible for monitoring \nrisk exposures of the enterprise \nand promoting risk management \npractices throughout S&T. Our ERM \nframework is overseen by our chief \nrisk officer, who has a dual reporting \nrelationship, directly accountable to \nboth the board 's risk committee and \nour CEO. You can find a description \nof the principal risks overseen by board \ncommittees in our proxy statement.\nIn addition, management has \nestablished internal committees that \nprovide oversight for various elements \nof our business that contribute to our \nrisk management activities including:\u2022 Asset/liability management \ncommittee\n\u2022 Enterprise risk management \ncommittee\n\u2022 Compliance committee \n\u2022 CRA/fair lending committee \n\u2022 Information security committee\n\u2022 Financial intelligence committee\n\u2022 Data governance committee\n\u2022 Disclosure control committee\n\u2022 Business continuity committee\nData privacy and cybersecurity\nThe board\u2019s risk committee oversees \nmanagement\u2019s programs and controls \nto maintain data privacy of customer \nrecords and cybersecurity. The risk \ncommittee reviews reports from and \nhas discussions with S&T\u2019s chief risk \nofficer , chief security officer, chief \ncompliance officer , and director of \noperations to ensure the adequacy of \ndata security programs and controls.\nThird-party risk management\nS& T\u2019s enterprise risk management \npractices extend to our supply chain. \nThe risk committee oversees our \nthird-party risk management program \nwhich is designed to identify, manage, \nand minimize third-party risk through \na centralized approach aligned with \nregulatory guidance and industry best \npractices. We manage the program \nto optimize Bank performance and \nenhance customer experience. \nExecutive compensation\nS&T\u2019s approach to goal setting, setting \nof targets with payouts at multiple \nlevels of performance, and evaluation \nof performance results, assist in \nmitigating excessive risk taking that \ncould harm our value or reward poor judgment by our executives. We \nbelieve that several features of our \ncompensation policies and programs \nreflect sound risk management \npractices. This includes basing \nincentive awards on the achievement \nof a predetermined earnings per share \n(EPS) goal (an audited number) and \ngranting restricted stock subject to \na two or three year vesting period \nthat serves the additional purposes \nof encouraging senior management \nto make decisions currently that \npromote long-term growth, promote \nretention of senior management, \nand encourage senior management \nto meet stock ownership guidelines. \nAll awards granted under the 2021 \nincentive plans were subject to \ncompensation committee review \nand approval based upon corporate \nand/or individual performance. The \nincentive plan for senior management, \nas described in the compensation \ndiscussion and analysis section of \nthe proxy statement, contains a \nminimum gateway requirement and a \nshareholder protection feature, which \nprovides a guarantee that awards will \nnot be made unless S&T achieves a \nReturn on Average Equity of at least \n5% and maintains well capitalized \ncapital ratio requirements, as \nestablished by applicable regulatory \nauthorities. S&T believes that \ncompensation among base salary and \nshort and long-term compensation \ntarget opportunities does not \nencourage excessive risk-taking. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STBA_2021.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
