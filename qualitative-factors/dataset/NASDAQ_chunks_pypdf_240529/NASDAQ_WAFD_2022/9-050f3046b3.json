Donations \nto Obliteride go toward cancer research at the \nworld-renowned Fred Hutch Cancer Research \nCenter in Seattle. Our 2022 Obliteride was \ndedicated to our colleague Chris Hooper, \nwho lost his battle to cancer this year. Over 50 WaFd Bank employees raised $16,435 \ntogether with WaFd matching $10,000 of those \ndonations for a total donation of $26,435. \nAlthough donations went to Fred Hutch in \nSeattle, employees across WaFd\u2019s eight state \nfootprint participated to help fund a way to find \nthe cure.\nHelping Small Businesses and Individuals  \nduring a Pandemic: When the Pandemic \nbrought economic shutdown in early 2020, \nWaFd Bank responded in several ways. First, \nwe rolled out our Small Business Lifeline, a \nline of credit with 90-days \u201cno interest\u201d to \nsupport business cashflow needs while the \nFederal government readied its programs. \nWe also provided homeowners with payment \ndeferrals, and participated in the SBA\u2019s \nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP) to help \nprovide businesses with PPP loans. This gave \nus an opportunity to be nimble, apply hard \nwork and use our technology to serve clients, \nnon-clients, and more broadly, our greater \ncommunities. PPP loan efforts allowed us to \nearn new client relationships while helping \nbusinesses access funding in a time of need.\n\u2022 Over 9,000 PPP loans were originated \ntotaling about $1,085,000,000.\n\u2022 Approximately  50% of the PPP loan  \nclients were new to WaFd Bank.\n\u2022 More than 8,800 loans have been  \nforgiven, totaling $1,075,000,000.\n7", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WAFD_2022.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
