{"page_content": "67Packaging \nWe explore innovative solutions to reduce the environmental impact of \nour packaging. At the end of 2018, we incorporated bags made of 100% \nbiodegradable and compostable material in the packaging of Mercado \nEnvios in Argentina and Brazil. The first evaluation of the product will \nbe completed with the implementation of 4 million bags of bioplastic in \nshipments from the company\u2019s intermediate distribution centers.\nBioplastics are an planet- friendly solution because, unlike conventional \nplastics, which take 500 years to decompose, they last only the time it \ntakes for microorganisms to biodegrade them. In a compost environment, \nthis occurs in a few weeks. The new packing envelopes are free of \nchemicals known or suspected to have a negative impact on human \nhealth. They also incorporate a rising percentage of raw materials of plant \norigin (starches, sugars, oils, cellulose, etc.).\nThe Argentine company Biop SA is our strategic partner in the project. \nIt has worked with our current packaging suppliers to develop the new \nbags. The inputs used have international certifications such as EN13432 \nfrom the European Union, ASTM 6400-04 from the United States, ISO \n17,088 (2008) and AB-Vin\u00e7otte (Ok-Compost and Ok-BioBased).We are the first e-commerce company in\nLatin America to use bioplastics for shipments.4 millions  bioplastic bags Carbon Footprint: 103-2, 103-3, 303-1, SASB: CG-EC-130a.2, CG-EC-410a.2 Environment 67\nvegetable \noilssuga rcellulose proteins\nCO2\ncaptur e\nFries\nfactor y\nBioplastics \nfactor y\nPackaging\nfactoryIndividual users\nand organizationsIndustrial o r\nhome compostin g", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2019.pdf", "page": 66, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
