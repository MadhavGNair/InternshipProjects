For the analysis, the difference in the sizes of each \nsample was taken into account so as not to affect the general results.\nThe questionnaire included an open-ended question asking stakeholders \nto indicate any critical issues and concerns they felt should be included. \nMost of the answers could be framed in one of the material topics listed, \nsuch as mitigating emissions of shipments and packaging (Environmental \nfootprint), the sale of prohibited articles (Buyer and merchant behavior), \nretained payments and security in purchases (User trust and security).\n20,000 representatives   \nof our stakeholder groups\nparticipated in the materiality analysis102-21, 102-44, 012-49 Sustainability strategy 21\nBrazil", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2019.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
