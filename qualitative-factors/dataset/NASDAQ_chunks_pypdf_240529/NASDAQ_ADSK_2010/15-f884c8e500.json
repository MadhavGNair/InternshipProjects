IP rights, especially related to copyright \nand patents, provide the legal underpinning for software development and licensing. this body of law enables us to invest in software innovation and recover our investments in the marketplace. Software piracy, on the other hand, is a form of theft that threatens this economic dynamic. A recent report from the business Software Alliance (bSA) states that the worldwide software piracy rate is at 41%, exceeding 90%\u00b9 in some countries. Our public policy advocacy calls for reasonable and balanced IP laws to help ensure that innovation is rewarded and piracy is minimized.\nAutodesk has supported strong IP provisions in countries worldwide, including through \ntreaties with members of the World t rade Organization, so that our licenses are enforceable \nand actually enforced. We also have advanced reforms to the u .S. patent law to help ensure \nthat it keeps pace with technological change while reducing litigiousness. In addition, we urge policy makers globally to support appropriate civil and criminal enforcement actions  to address large-scale piracy operations.\nWe have also supported other policies related to innovation, such as the u .S. Research  \nand development t ax Credit and similar measures to stimulate domestic investment  \nin software development.In response to the global financial crisis in 2009, many countries accelerated their investment \nin green energy and infrastructure projects to stimulate economic activity and build a foundation for future growth. Autodesk engaged with government officials, nonprofit organizations, think tanks, and other entities to advance sustainable design principles, especially with regard to infrastructure development, and to support policies that help reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. t o this end, Autodesk:\n\u2022\tProvided advice to policy makers in the u .S.
