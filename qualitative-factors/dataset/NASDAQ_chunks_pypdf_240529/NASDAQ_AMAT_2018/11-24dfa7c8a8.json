T o this end, we continuously seek \nto identify and pursue opportunities to improve \nour products. When we succeed, we help our \ncustomers lower the temperature and quantity of \nwater they use as well as reduce other forms of \nenergy demand in their operations and product \nuse. The Applied iSystem controller is one \nexample of how our products can help minimize \nour customers\u2019 energy and resource consumption \nin their semiconductor manufacturing. Advantages of Integrated SubFab \nComponents\nIn today\u2019s semiconductor fab, the focus on saving \nenergy and resources has shifted from facility \noperations to the subfab, which contains support \nequipment (pumps, abatement systems, etc.) \nthat can consume more energy than any other \nfab equipment component. T o reduce energy \nconsumption and conserve natural resources, \nwe offer the Applied iSystem controller, which \nincorporates a hot standby idle mode in subfab \ncontrol systems. The Applied iSystem is the \nindustry\u2019s only subfab solution that optimizes \nsubfab resource consumption without the \nadded risk to process or throughput. While \nmonitoring tool operation, the Applied iSystem \ncontroller collects valuable data that can be used \nto generate resource consumption and GHG \nemissions reports, among other environmental \nfactors. More than 3,000 pieces of subfab \nequipment in customer fabs are connected \nto the Applied iSystem and predecessor \ncontrol systems, thereby supporting customer \nsustainability initiatives.\nA new predictive control technology\u2014a \nsleep mode\u2014based on SEMI1 standard E175 \nrequirements was developed in FY18. Internal \nstudies have shown that, in practice, sleep mode \ncould double the energy and resource savings \navailable with idle mode. More information about \nApplied iSystem is available on our website. Employee Eco Programs\nT o complement our efforts to reduce Applied\u2019s operational GHG emissions, \nwe offer carpools, ride-matching, vanpool and other programs and services to \nhelp our employees reduce their personal GHG emissions in California, T exas, \nMassachusetts and Montana. Similar programs are routinely being assessed for \nimplementation at other locations.\n1 The SEMI International Standards Program is one of the \nkey services offered by Semiconductor Equipment and \nMaterials International (SEMI). The program operates as \na neutral forum for the exchange of information among \nsuppliers and users, resulting in the production of timely \nand technically accurate specifications and other standards \nof economic importance to the industry. \nApplied iSystem controller\nApplied Materials CSR Report 2018  |  EHS 12On-campus, app based gas \ndelivery through Booster \n(Silicon Valley)  \nElectric vehicle (EV) charging \nstations at our campuses  \nNearly 500 employees \ntelecommuting in our Applied \nAnywhere ProgramThe option of a subsidized, \nroundtrip, door-to-door \ncarpool  \nPreferred parking for carpool \nand hybrid/ electric vehicles  \n18 T elepresence capability for \nvirtual meetings across the \ncompanyPublic and alternative \ntransportation incentives  \n \nBike to Work Days: Employees \nleave their cars at home and \ninstead, bike to work.\nReducing business travel to \nlower Scope 3 GHG emissionsWORLDWIDE NORTH AMERICA CALIFORNIA", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2018.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
