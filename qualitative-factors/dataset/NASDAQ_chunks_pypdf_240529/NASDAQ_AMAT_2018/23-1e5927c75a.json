This year, our Office of \nthe Chief T echnology Officer (CTO) created a new partnership with \nthe Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN) at North \nCarolina A&T State University, a nationally recognized Historically Black \nCollege and University (HBCU) dating back to 1890. This partnership \nenables the company to support the development of cutting-edge \ntechnology and build relationships with faculty and students at a \nleading HBCU\u2014a key component of expanding our diverse talent \npipeline. \nDeveloping future talent through internships is a key part of our \noutreach. More than 250 college students globally had the opportunity \nin 2018 to gain real-world experience and insight into a future career in \ntechnology: \n\u2022 150+ interns in the United States. Students not only gained \ntraining and experience, they also engaged in local office \nteam-building events and community outreach. In Silicon Valley, \ninterns had an opportunity to learn about new technology and \nthe industry value chain by participating in the Engineering and \nT echnology conference and SEMICON/West.\n\u2022 50+ Interns in Korea, India, Taiwan and Singapore. Since its \ninception in 2013, our Summer Student Program in T aiwan \ncontinues to motivate students with tours, technology equipment \nlectures, technical seminars and executive talks.\nOur programs offer participants unique industry knowledge and \nhands-on experience, including employee mentoring, training, lectures \nfrom renowned professors and exclusive networking sessions with our \nexecutives.
