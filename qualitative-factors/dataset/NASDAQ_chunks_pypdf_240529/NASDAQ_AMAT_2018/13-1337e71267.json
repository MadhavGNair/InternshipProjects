These \nrecycling programs improved our waste diversion rate from 75 \npercent in 2017 to 81 percent in 2018. The overall volume of material \ndestined for landfill decreased by more than two tons in 2018, a \nresult of continual efforts to reduce non-recyclable landfill-bound \nwastes, as previously discussed.  By integrating the reduction, \nreuse or recycling of materials into the operational cadence of our \nlocations, continuing to work with our employees and manufacturing \npartners, and encouraging manufacturing locations to establish \nindividual waste management targets, we reduced our solid waste. \nAs a stakeholder within the communities in which Applied operates, \nwe recognize that managing our waste is not only good for the \nenvironment, it also makes sound business sense.48% \nLandfill (non-hazardous)\n81%\nDiversion rate up 6 pointsPhoto\nFocus on Reuse or Recycling\nIn response to employee interest and to help raise awareness of \nsustainability practices, we facilitated the collection, recycling and \nreuse of materials in 2018\u2014all in partnership with local community \norganizations. Our Diagnostics and Control group in Israel re-purposed \ngently-used toys and clothes to support nonprofit agencies. Our team \nin Malta, New Y ork expanded their waste diversion efforts to include \nan electronics recycling drive as well as a bottle and can collection to \nbenefit a youth service organization.During Applied\u2019s annual EarthWorks environmental campaign, Santa \nClara employees teamed up with an arts-education nonprofit to learn \nabout the impact of plastic on the oceans while creating art from \nrecycled objects. Employees in Israel welcomed the addition of more \nthan 100 new recycling containers\u2014including units dedicated to \nelectronics recycling\u2014to their facilities.\nAs a corporation and through the initiative of passionate employees,  \nwe are committed to continuing our focus on reuse and recycling.\nApplied Materials CSR Report 2018  |  EHS 14", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2018.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
