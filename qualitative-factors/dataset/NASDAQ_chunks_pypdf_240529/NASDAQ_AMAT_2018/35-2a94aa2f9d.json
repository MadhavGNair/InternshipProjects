While Applied Materials and the Applied Materials Foundation have invested in education \nprograms in low-income communities for more than a decade, the specific challenges faced by young \ngirls as they explore future career paths necessitate a more targeted strategy.\nIn 2018, the Applied Materials Foundation launched Generation Girl, a new initiative to work toward \na future where all girls have the opportunity to reach their potential. We are engaging with nonprofit \norganizations around the country to help girls gain the confidence, skills and opportunities they need to \nsucceed in any path they choose.\nThis program is currently active in the United States in Austin, T exas; Gloucester, Massachusetts; and in \nthe Silicon Valley region in California.\nPhoto\nApplied Materials CSR Report 2018  |  Community 36", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2018.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
