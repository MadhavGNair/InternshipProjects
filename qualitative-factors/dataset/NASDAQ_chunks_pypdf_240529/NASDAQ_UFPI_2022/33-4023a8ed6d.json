We have a Safety Career Path in which we \nencourage people to move into safety roles. Regional Safety Summits \nare held every year to keep our people aware of the latest advances \nin safety methods and practices, while our yearly Safety Week puts \nan organizational emphasis on our safety programs. We celebrate \nindividual and plant achievements, such as records for consecutive \ndays of accident-free operation. We ensure proper monitoring \npractices, and our plant management and safety committee members \nperform periodic worksite inspections to identify and address \nany unsafe work practices or safety hazards.
