At age 15, only 0.5% of \nwomen worldwide want to become a science \nand technology professional, compared to 5% \nof men (OECD, 2018). This lack of interest affects \ntheir extracurricular education choices and their \nexperiences at school. As the largest tech company \nin Latin America, we took on the challenge to \nreduce this gap. \nIn 2021, we launched the \u201cConectadas\u201d program , \na regional initiative to bring more girls and young \nwomen between 14 and 18 years of age closer to \nthe world of technology. This immersive, online, and \nfree-of-charge experience aims to help them with \ntools, experts, and self-confidence development so \nthey can create solutions for the challenges they \nidentify in the region.\n\u201cConectadas\u201d seeks to build a network of \ncommitted and empowered young women. In \ngroups from different regions and environments, \nthey develop technology-based projects as they \nlearn about digital transformation, 4.0 economy, \nsustainability, UX research and data, digital \nproject and business development, and digital \ncommunication and marketing.   Reducing the gender gap in technology requires \ncollective action. We worked together with Chicas \nen Tecnolog\u00eda, an Argentinian organization that \npromotes technology to contribute to gender equity, \nand {reprograma}, a Brazilian social enterprise that \nteaches programming to women, prioritizing the \nBlack and trans communities.\n\u201cConectadas\u201d stands out for building a community \nthat inspires, empowers, and encourages women \nto be protagonists.  Not only does it transform the \nparadigm of thousands of girls and teenagers in \nLatin America, but also connects them with other \nwomen in the region and technology leaders. These \nwomen influence the perception that these girls \nhave of themselves, their potential to champion \nthe changes they believe necessary, and their \nempowerment to attain these goals.1329\nyoung women in Latin America\nparticipated in \u201cConectadas\u201d in 2022\n200\ngraduates participated\nin technology mentorships, \nworkshops, and bootcamps52\nMELI women volunteers\nparticipated as mentors172\nimpact project ideas\noriginated by participants\n7\ncountries in the region\nArgentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, \nMexico, Peru, and Uruguay87%\ndiscovered that they enjoy \nstudying, researching and \nworking on technology issues\nMore information\n92%\nlearned about training and professional \ndevelopment options in technology\n80%\nknow what they wants to do in their \nfuture career and academic career\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2022.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
