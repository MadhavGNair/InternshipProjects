{"page_content": "6 2022 Impact Report\nAbout this report\nBusiness\nExperience\nOur team\nSocial\nEnvironment\nGRI, SASB & IR\nMateriality process\nIn 2022, we adapted our annual materiality exercise to the recommendations of the new Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI) Universal Standards 2021 for the definition of contents. \nFirst of all, we had to understand our organizational context, which is accounted for in our value creation \nmodel; the potential risks that could affect our business, described in the 10-K Risk Factors section; the social \nimpact assessment performed in 2021 by the Euromonitor market research company, and the Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosure Report we developed in line with the TCFD.\nWe identified our actual and potential business impacts based on the materiality defined by the SASB \nindicators for the E-commerce and Consumer finance industries. We also carried out a benchmark study \nagainst seven strategic organizations to understand and identify industry impacts. We compared these results \nwith our sustainability strategy and our list of material issues from 2021.\nWe selected 13 impacts that we considered significant for our business. Then, we conducted a materiality \nsurvey where over 62,900 stakeholders rated the most significant impacts that we should manage as a \npriority. As part of their assessment, the respondents were also asked if, in their opinion, any other major issue \nor impact should be added.\nThe sustainability team worked on the suggestions by our stakeholders and the validation results of each \naspect. Accordingly, the 13 impacts were included as material issues. They were ranked by importance and \ntheir effect on the economy, the environment, and the people.\nAs part of this process, and in line with the new impact and stakeholder concepts under the GRI Universal \nStandards 2021, we redefined the scope of the issues in the previous period. We included \u201cProduct innovation \nand development\u201d as a material issue, and replaced the following names: \u201cDriving entrepreneurship\u201d with \n\u201cEmpowering entrepreneurs, SMEs, and NGOs;\u201d \u201cHuman capital and talent attraction\u201d with \u201cTeam formation \nand development;\u201d \u201cEconomic performance and positioning\u201d with \u201cEconomic performance;\u201d \u201cClimate change \nand energy efficiency\u201d with \u201cClimate change: energy, mobility, and packaging;\u201d and \u201cDigital inclusion and \neducation\u201d with \u201cEducation for digital inclusion.\u201d Moreover, the impacts included in the 2021 material issues \n\u201cBuyer and seller behavior\u201d and \u201cUser trust and security\u201d were restructured under the new material issues \n\u201cInformation privacy and security\u201d and \u201cProduct and service trust and security,\u201d respectively.120\nPrivate sector102\nSupply Chain4109\nChile245\nColombia\n69\nNGOs12\nMedia5622\nMexico10\nParaguay\n8\nPublic sector11\nOthers860\nPeru3215\nUruguay\n17\nVenezuela250 \nOtherCOUNTRY\nDISTRIBUTION\n32,549\nArgentina16,072\nBrazilSTAKEHOLDER\nDISTRIBUTION\n56,492\nUsers6135\nEmployees62,949\nTotal62,949\nTotal62,949 \nTOTAL \nRESPONSESSURVEYAbout this Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2022.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
