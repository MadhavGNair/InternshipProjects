In partnership with PretaHub, we supported the business activities \nof Black and indigenous communities in the region to position themselves in the digital era.  \nSince 2018, we have been providing resources and conducting training sessions in online sales strategies \nfor handicraft, design, beauty, and cosmetics entrepreneurs promoting Afro-Brazilian and indigenous \nidentities in Brazil. We highlighted their stories and products in an official and exclusive Feira Preta store. \nThe first edition of this event took place in 2002 as an on-site fair. Today, it is a representative festival on our \nmarketplace that highlights the value of the most innovative Black creativity areas. \nSince 2021, we have brought the Afrolab methodology, a program of support and promotion of afro-\nentrepreneurship led by Preta Hub, online sales content and digital tools to 120 black and indigenous \nentrepreneurs in Colombia.
