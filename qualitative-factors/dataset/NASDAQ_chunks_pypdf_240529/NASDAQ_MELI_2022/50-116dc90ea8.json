We designed a comprehensive plan to assess products that are no longer in use but in \nperfect condition to be used or consumed, and include them in our stock inventory and logistics schedule to \nbe delivered to vulnerable communities across Latin America. We partnered with 5 civil society organizations. \nIn this way, we avoid sending thousands of products to landfills, while contributing to the development of the \ncommunities where we are present.BRAZIL\n22\nProjects carried out\nin 2022 supported by Mercado Libre\nDonateSocial", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2022.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
