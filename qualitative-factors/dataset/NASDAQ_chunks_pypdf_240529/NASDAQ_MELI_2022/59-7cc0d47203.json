All the cardboard we use \nhas full traceability along its value chain, is Forest \nStewardship Council (FSC)-certified or soon-to-be-\ncertified, or is made of recycled material. \nThe FSC seal guarantees that manufacturing \nprocesses adhere to responsible forest practices. \nIn addition, all boxes used at present in our \noperations are manufactured with at least 30% \nrecycled cardboard, and 60% of the boxes already \ninclude 50% recycled material. In Mexico, plastic \nbags already include 55% recycled content. We are \nevaluating alternatives for the rest of the markets \nas well. 100% \nRECYCLABLE, \nREUSABLE, \nor compostable packaging100% \nFOREST \nSTEWARDSHIP \nCOUNCIL-CERTIFIED\nor soon-to-be-certified cardboard\n10%+ \nMERCHANDISE \nSHIPPED\nwithout additional packaging100% \nBAGS\ninclude 55% recycled plastic content \nin MexicoWe work non-stop to reduce packaging volumes. \nSince 2020, some products can be shipped in \ntheir primary wrapping material, without additional \npackaging. Thanks to this initiative, paper boxes and \nplastic envelopes are replaced with a single label \naffixed directly to the merchandise. In this way, we \nuse less packaging while optimizing space and, \nconsequently, transportation fuel and \nwaste generation. \nPilot projects conducted in Argentina and Brazil \nshowed up to a 40% reduction in air transported. In \n2022, this project was implemented at all the large \nfulfillment centers in the region: Argentina, Brazil, \nMexico, Chile, and Colombia. The fully implemented \nproject applied to 10.93% of the total volume of \nmerchandise shipped and attained a 50% reduction \nin the space occupied and warehouse dispatch \nprocessing times.
