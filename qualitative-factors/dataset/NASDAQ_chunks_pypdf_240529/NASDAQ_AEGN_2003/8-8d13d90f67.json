AEGON \ncountry units, however, adopt the guidelines and \nprinciples set out by the AEGON Group. This Corporate Responsibility Report covers all major \ncountry units and all product and service lines. \nFinancial information and information on the \nnumber of employees is identical as in the Annual \nReport 2003 and therefore covers the entire group. \nOther information is retrieved through internal \nquestionnaires and covers the entire organization \nwith the larger exceptions being: \n\u2666 \tThe new operations mentioned before; \n\u2666 \tThe units that were sold in 2003 \n(Transamerica Finance Corporation); \n\u2666 \tMee\u00f9s, a Dutch insurance and financial intermediary owned by AEGON. \nAEGON believes this report is a first step towards \nextending the group\u2019s reporting system by \ncovering non-financial issues. AEGON aims to \nmake more progress and strives to improve the \nmanner of reporting and communications with \nshareholders and other stakeholders. \nThis report has been coordinated by the Group \nCorporate Responsibility department. We invite you \nto share your opinion on AEGON\u2019s corporate responsibility ambitions and reporting (e-mail: \nresponse@aegon.nl). \n2.3 Report profile \nFor this first Corporate Responsibility Report the \nreporting guidelines of the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI) have served as a starting point. \nAEGON believes the GRI structure provides a \nuniform platform to follow that will enable different \naudiences to relate to the report. AEGON has chosen to focus on those GRI indicators it believes \nto be most relevant in the insurance sector. The \ncontents of this report are based on a \ncomprehensive internal corporate responsibility \nquestionnaire and AEGON internal information \nsystems. \nThis report is not audited by external accountants. \nInformation in this report comes either from published reports such as the Annual Report 2003, \nor is based on the above-mentioned corporate \nresponsibility questionnaire. Going forward, \nAEGON will consider the requirements and \ndesirability of external verification and implement \naccordingly. 2.4 Disclaimer \nPlease read this notice carefully - it applies to all \npersons who read this Corporate Responsibility \nReport and, depending on who you are and where \nyou live, it may affect your rights.
