It evolved from the \nScottish Equitable Staff Association into an organization with nearly 3000 members throughout the UK.  \nMichael Gray, the General Secretary, became involved wi th Aegis after spending over ten years working in  \nthe marketing and purchasing areas of Scottish Equitable.  Attracting him to the role in the first place was  \nthe scope to influence the way in which the business developed its relationship with employees. Scottish \nEquitable was a friendly small mutual, the challenge wi th AEGON involvement was to try preserve the good \nparts of the old culture whilst appreciating the huge benefi ts of being part of a multi national. Typically this  \nhas been achieved through detailed consultation, negotiation and the ability of the both sides to compromise \nwhen appropriate. This seems to be an indication of  a mature rational relationship between the company and \nstaff based on mutual respect. \n\u201cWhilst nothing is perfect we do know that employee terms & conditions within AEGON UK are amongst the \nbest in the industry. The company tells us that it is striving to become an \u2018employer of choice\u2019 and we know \nthere is much more to that than giving people a good wage and a nice building to work in.
