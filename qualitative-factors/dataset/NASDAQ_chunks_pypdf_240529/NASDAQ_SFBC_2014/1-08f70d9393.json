They are completely devoted to supporting Make-A-Wish\u00ae Alaska and Washington.  They have adopted wishes throughout Washington.  Not only do they support wishes financially, they go the extra mile by participating in the wish.  Their employees helped a little girl experience her wish to have a room makeover by rolling up their sleeves to paint and decorate.  That is just one of many examples.  They never stop searching for new ways to support our chapter.  They sponsor our Wish Night Gala & Auction which raises funds to help grant wishes to some of the 400 local children awaiting their wishes.  And, they appoint an employee to serve on our corporate council each year, which helps leverage additional support from new corporations throughout the community.   \nSimply put, their time, talent and treasure allows Make-A-Wish to provide hope, strength, \nand joy to our wish families during their time of greatest need.  \nMaria Carbullido\nAVP Branch Manager", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SFBC_2014.pdf", "page": 1, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
