We work with both large beauty \nbrands that have well-established supply chain infrastructures, and up-and-coming brands that may need \nextra guidance. The visibility of the Ulta Beauty brand provides a platform for other brands to succeed. \nThe SPARKED at Ulta Beauty program, which features a rotation of emerging brands throughout the \nyear, enables emerging brands with inspiring stories to showcase their products in a larger setting. \nWe provide suppliers with our Ulta Vendor Standards, which outline our expectations for ethical business  \nconduct, worker safety, environmental protection and products. Our supplier relations team onboards new  \nbrands and vendors, using webinars and other tools to educate them on how to succeed with us, and, for  \ndiverse-owned vendors, how to earn diverse supplier certification. We expect vendors to not only abide by our \nstandards, but also pass them along to their own vendors engaged in the production of goods or services that  \nwe ultimately purchase. \nVendors who develop Ulta Beauty Collection\u00ae products sign a manufacturing agreement as well as a social \ncompliance agreement. In addition, factory inspections and third-party audits are conducted to evaluate work \npractices as appropriate. \nUlta Beauty offerings \nPRODUCTS\n oCosmetics\n oFragrance\n oHaircare\n oSkincare\n oBath and body products\n oSalon styling tools  SALON SERVICES\n oHair cut, color, treatment  \n and styling\n oLash applications\n oMakeup\n oBrow and wax services\n oEar piercing \n2021  \nESG Report24 Product People Introduction Environment Supplemental Data Community", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ULTA_2021.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
