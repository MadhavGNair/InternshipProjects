Supporting our Associates, Customers, and neighbors in times of need has always been important to us, which is why the Ross Stores Foundation supports the American Red Cross. The Red Cross has the knowledge, expertise, and resources to quickly and efficiently help communities affected by all types of disasters. \nIn recent years, the Ross Stores Foundation has \ndonated to American Red Cross Disaster Relief, powering the organization\u2019s response efforts for hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, floods, and more. In 2020 our contributions ensured that the Red Cross could respond quickly to the hundreds of wildfires that burned across the country, with several taking place near our Stores, Distribution Centers, and Dublin Corporate Office, as well as to Hurricane Laura, which brought extreme winds and heavy rainfall to Louisiana and other parts of the Southeast. \nThrough the years, our support has helped the Red \nCross provide shelter, meals, mental health services, and many other types of immediate relief in the aftermath of disasters, mainly in the United States. \nThe American Red Cross name, logo, and copyright materials are used \nwith its permission with no express or implied endorsement. \n28 Ross Stores, Inc., 2020 Corporate Social Responsibility Report ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ROST_2020.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
