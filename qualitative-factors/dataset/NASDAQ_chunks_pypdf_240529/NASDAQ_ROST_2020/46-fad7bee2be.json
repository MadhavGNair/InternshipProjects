During \nthis period, internal reporting processes were adapted to use digital tools instead of paper. One such change will eliminate more than 100 tons of paper use annually, and we plan to continue using the new process moving forward. \n\u2022 When we do print, we minimize the environmental \nimpact by using paper that has postconsumer content; setting printers to print double-sided; and using large-capacity, refurbished toner cartridges that result in less plastic, steel, aluminum, and rubber waste compared to traditional toners. We also have a program to recycle office paper. \u2022 At our Corporate Office, 100 percent of Company-\nprovided flatware and utensils are reusable or compostable, and we encourage the use of reusable plates as well. We also supply deskside recycling bins and provide convenient organic waste and single-stream recycling receptacles in common areas. \n\u2022 The majority of our Associates receive electronic \npaychecks, which reduces paper use. \n\u2022 Hydration stations are available to reduce single-use \nplastic bottle waste. \n\u2022 An e-waste recycling program handles damaged \nor obsolete electronic equipment. \n46 Ross Stores, Inc., 2020 Corporate Social Responsibility Report ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ROST_2020.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
