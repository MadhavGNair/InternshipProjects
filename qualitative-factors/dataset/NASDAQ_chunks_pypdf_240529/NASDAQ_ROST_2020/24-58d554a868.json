When faced with this challenge, the Stores stepped up to execute a creative solution that also benefitted our national community partners. If our cashiers could not provide exact change or have the Customer use an alternative form of payment, Customers were invited to round up their purchase to the nearest dollar and donate the difference to BGCA or First Book. Once again our Customers stepped up and raised a sizable, unexpected gift of more than $370,000 combined for BGCA and First Book. \n24 Ross Stores, Inc., 2020 Corporate Social Responsibility Report ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ROST_2020.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
