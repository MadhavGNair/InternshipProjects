In the adopted Clubs, the Ross Stores Foundation offers an annual grant and scholarship program for high-achieving college-bound high school seniors. Ross is also a national sponsor of BGCA\u2019s Power Hour, an after-school homework-help program. \nDuring Power Hour, Club members receive support in completing their homework to improve their academic performance \nand develop a sense of personal responsibility.
