Across the landscape of other Fortune 500 companies, her career trajectory and role as a female Chief Executive Officer stands out for prospective and current Associates. \nStories like these demonstrate the power of belonging \nand that opportunity is always in season at Ross. Nurturing Understanding \nOver the course of 2020, we rolled out unconscious bias training, and Associates at every level of the organization learned practical guidelines for fostering an inclusive workplace. This training focused on building skills to support diversity and introduced language and tips related to bias, inclusion, and engaging in respectful conversations. We also implemented DE&I Overview Training for all Associates at the Vice President level and above and all Store Managers via 200 classes. Collectively, Store Supervisors, Distribution Center Directors, and all Corporate and Buying Office Associates completed more than 13,000 DE&I e-learning sessions. \nTo build on this momentum, we launched a dedicated \nDE&I portal for Associates, where we provided and continue to offer on-demand learning resources and guided roundtable discussions about a variety of topics. We also carried out our annual training on Ross\u2019 Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for full-time Associates and non-harassment training for all Associates. \nRoss Stores, Inc., 2020 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 9 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ROST_2020.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
