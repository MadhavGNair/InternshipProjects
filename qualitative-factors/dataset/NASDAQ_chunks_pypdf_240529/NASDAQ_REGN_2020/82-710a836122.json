S\nNAPSHOTSupporting New York State\u2019s COVID-19 Response \nAt the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in the U.S., Regeneron\u2019s \nhome state of New York faced critical supply shortages. Regeneron proactively reached out to the New York Governor\u2019s office to see if there were other ways we could support the COVID-19 response effort beyond our work in the labs to invent an antibody treatment. From our discussions, we found Regeneron had the unique skills and expertise to manufacture viral transport media (VTM), an important component of the COVID-19 test-collection kits being prepared by the State.\nOur IOPS team sprang to action, working long hours to \nobtain the necessary components, determine formulas to meet the state\u2019s specifications and make 1 million units of VTM that we then dispensed into test tubes. We donated 100 percent of our time and supplies/materials, an in-kind contribution valued at approximately $1.2 million.
