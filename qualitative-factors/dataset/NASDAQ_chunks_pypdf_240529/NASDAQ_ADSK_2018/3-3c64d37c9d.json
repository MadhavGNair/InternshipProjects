They include a wide range of companies,  \ndesign firms, academic institutions, nonprofits, and entrepreneurs in the architecture, \nengineering, construction, product design, and manufacturing fields. We deliver solutions that \nour customers use to make more and better things, with less negative impact on the world.\nArchitecture, engineering, and construction: Operational energy use in buildings is responsible \nfor 32 percent of energy consumption globally and 19 percent of energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n1 While it is not uncommon for operational energy use to account for as \nmuch as 90 percent of a building\u2019s environmental impacts,2 the construction process also offers \nsignificant potential for improvement. Research indicates that more than 30 percent of construction activity is related to rework,\n3 and as much as 30 percent of construction \nmaterial is wasted on-site,4 costing time, money, and natural resources. The urgency of \nreducing these impacts is compounded by global demographic trends. As the global population shifts and urbanizes over the next 30 years, the construction industry will need to build an \naverage of 13,000 buildings every day in urban areas.\n5 Indeed, 60 percent of urban areas \nanticipated to exist in 2030 have yet to be built.6 As a result, industry demand will continue  \nto rise for solutions that enable architects, engineers, and contractors to support this rapid \ngrowth more sustainably by improving energy and materials productivity.\nOur customers are increasingly working to make net-zero energy buildings, implement low \nwaste and industrialized construction, and develop smart and sustainable cities. Providing \nautomation tools to support these objectives affordably and at scale is central to our sustainability efforts. The Autodesk\n\u00ae Architecture, Engineering & Construction Collection  \nand our cloud platform help enable customers to achieve these outcomes.\nAutodesk\u00ae Revit\u00ae, InfraWorks\u00ae 360, AutoCAD\u00ae Civil 3D\u00ae, BIM 360\u00ae, CFD, FormIt\u00ae 360 Pro, Insight, \nNavisworks\u00ae, Fabrication CAMductTM, and Robot\u2122 Structural Analysis Professional software\nBuilding design and \nretrofit\u2022 Design high-performance buildings\n\u2022 Conduct energy analysis from concept through to complex modeling \n\u2022 Prioritize retrofits across property portfolios\n\u2022 Use structural materials efficiently\n\u2022 Plan for smart decommissioning of buildings and related materials recovery\nInfrastructure \u2022 Plan for resilience and adaptation to climate change\n\u2022 Prioritize projects based on social, environmental, and economic impacts\n\u2022 Manage bioretention and green stormwater\n\u2022 Conduct traffic impact analysis\n\u2022 Conduct pollution modeling\nConstruction \u2022 Streamline schedules and logistics\n\u2022 Minimize waste during construction\n\u2022 Design for offsite and prefabrication design\n\u2022 Increase precision to maximize built performance\n1. https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter9.pdf , Chapter 9: Buildings.\n2. http://www.journalofgreenbuilding.com/doi/abs/10.3992/jgb.7.3.151\n3. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291000555_Cost_Management_in_Construction_Projects_Rework_and_Its_Effects\n4. https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814753/waste, Chapter 15: Construction Waste.\n5.
