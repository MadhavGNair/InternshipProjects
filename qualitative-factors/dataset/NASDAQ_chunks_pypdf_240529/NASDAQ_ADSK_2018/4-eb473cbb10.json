In fiscal year 2018, 2.3 \nmillion people visited the Autodesk \nUniversity website and watched 87,000  \nhours of instructional video.Product design and manufacturing: Manufacturing represents 19 percent of GHG emissions \nand 37 percent of energy consumption globally,\n7 and a substantial amount of materials use. \nTime, money, energy, and materials are often wasted due to production bottlenecks, machine \nidling, inefficient product runs, and poor design. Indeed, manufacturers can reduce energy use \nby up to 25 percent and increase productivity through smart and connected manufacturing \ntechniques.8 As the prices of raw materials continue to fluctuate, consumers demand more \nenvironmentally friendly products, and regulations increase, these pressures will only grow. \nTo address these challenges, Autodesk customers are implementing smarter and more \nefficient manufacturing approaches, increasing materials productivity, developing more circular business models, and enhancing supply chain responsibility. Leveraging automation to integrate design and manufacturing processes plays an essential role and helps designers \nand engineers achieve productivity boosts and deliver more sustainable products. The \nAutodesk\n\u00ae Product Design & Manufacturing Collection and our cloud platform help customers \ndeliver on these objectives.\nAutodesk\u00ae Fusion 360\u2122, Inventor\u00ae, CFD, Factory Design Utilities, Fusion Connect, Helius Composite, \nHelius PFA, Moldflow\u00ae Design, NetFabb\u00ae, Simulation Mechanical, TruNest Multi-Tool, and Within \nsoftware\nProduct / industrial \ndesign\u2022 Create lighter products through generative design and composites\n\u2022 Maximize use of energy-efficient electronics and machines\n\u2022 Improve materials efficiency\n\u2022 Make greener materials choices\n\u2022 Conduct simulations to test and design more durable products\nFactory \u2022 Analyze building energy consumption (individual, campus, portfolio)\n\u2022 Conduct layout and process optimization for lean manufacturing\n\u2022 Optimize and retrofit HVAC systems \n\u2022 Reduce energy use and waste between manufacturing runs of  \ndifferent products\n\u2022 Use digital twins to conduct predictive maintenance\nPlanning and process \u2022 Optimize machine use\n\u2022 Nest pieces to optimize flat sheet cutting and reduce waste \nAdditive manufacturing  \n(3D printing)\u2022 Use support-material efficiently to reduce waste\n\u2022 Improve print accuracy and success rate to decrease waste\n7.
