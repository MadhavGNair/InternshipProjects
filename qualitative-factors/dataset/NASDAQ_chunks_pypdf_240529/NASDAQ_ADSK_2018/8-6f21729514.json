We seek out impact-driven, design-\noriented organizations\u2014from accelerators and \nincubators, to social enterprises and startups\u2014and help them scale. We provide funding, software, training, and related support, so these organizations can have the greatest impact possible. Autodesk, \nInc. business units also provide direct funding for \ndesign and engineering programs and projects in their respective industries.\nSince it launched, the Autodesk Foundation has \nsupported entrepreneurs and innovators who are designing a better world. Our recent investments \nhave focused on climate change mitigation \n(reducing GHG emissions) and adaptation (helping climate vulnerable communities adapt and thrive).\nIn early 2018, we also launched a new impact area \non positive human machine collaboration and made our first investments. Complementing our focus on \nclimate change, we are working to ensure that \nhuman beings not only survive but thrive through the disruptions and dislocations brought on by a warming planet and transformations in the way \nwe work. \nWe match charitable donations and provide paid \nvolunteer time so that our employees can support \nthe causes and organizations they care about most. In response to the many hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, and other natural disasters that \noccurred in 2017, our employees joined forces  \nto raise tens of thousands of dollars for disaster \nrelief and resilience-building efforts. Many also volunteered their time to provide direct aid in  \nthe days, weeks, and months following these \ndestructive events.
