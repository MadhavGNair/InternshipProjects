Greenhouse gas emissions from business travel are included in Scope 3: \u201cBusiness travel.\u201d Emissions from facilities are included in Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3: \u201cWaste generated in operations\u201d and \u201cLeased assets.\u201d \nEmissions from data centers are included in Scope 2 (related to purchased electricity) and Scope 3: \u201cPurchased goods and services.\u201d Emissions from major conferences are included in Scope 3: \u201cPurchased goods and services.\u201d \n11. Data for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 are calculated using the market-based accounting method, which takes into account purchased renewable energy and carbon offsets. Data for fiscal year 2009 uses a location-based methodology to calculate GHG emissions.\n12. These data are calculated based on the economic input-output lifecycle assessment model, using industry-specific emissions factors in conjunction with Autodesk\u2019s spend.\n13. Data for \"capital goods\" were calculated based on annual spend.\n14. LEED certifications as of January 31, 2018, include facilities in Beijing, China (Interior Design and Construction: Commercial Interiors [CI] Platinum), Shanghai, China (CI Gold), Mumbai, India (CI Platinum), Tel Aviv, Israel \n(CI Platinum), Milan, Italy (CI Gold), Singapore (CI Platinum), Farnborough, United Kingdom (CI Gold), and the following in the United States: San Francisco, California (CI Platinum [6]); San Rafael, California (CI Platinum); \nBoston, Massachusetts (CI Platinum); Lake Oswego, Oregon (CI Certified).\n15. Includes waste from major conferences and facilities. Data are extrapolated to our full real estate portfolio based on sites where data are available.

Since fiscal year 2009 \n(our baseline), we have decreased absolute GHG \nemissions by 38 percent, achieving our goal. \nBusiness travel: We seek to reduce the GHG \nemissions of meeting travel through virtual \nmeetings, partner education, a green rating system \nfor hotels, and by incorporating sustainability expectations into our standard meeting contracts.\n10\nFacilities: We assess our facilities\u2019 environmental operating practices related to energy use and other impact areas and create customized \nsustainability improvement plans. We also use \nour operations as test cases to help refine the functionality of our solutions, improve our environmental performance, and showcase how \ncustomers can use our solutions to meet their \nsustainability objectives.\n10\nData centers: In addition to using 100 percent renewable energy for our cloud services,  \nwe strive to minimize data center energy use \nthrough server virtualization, selection of \nefficient equipment that meets respected industry standards, and by streamlining our  \ncode. These efforts help us provide customers  \na faster, more reliable experience, with reduced environmental impacts.\n10\nMajor conferences: Since fiscal year 2016, Autodesk University has been carbon neutral, and in fiscal year 2017, we extended this effort to include One \nTeam Conference, our annual channel partner and \nsales summit. We decrease the climate impact of our conferences and other events by enhancing efficiency, providing virtual attendance options, \nreducing waste, and purchasing carbon offsets.\n10", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2018.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
