{"page_content": "Severe \nHypoglycemia \nin diabetes/\nZegalogue\nSevere hypoglycemia is an \nacute, life-threatening condition \nresulting from a critical \ndrop in blood glucose levels. \nUnpredictable and among the \nmost feared complications \nof diabetes treatment, severe \nhypoglycemia requires another \nperson for rescue.The International Hypoglycemia Study Group defines \nhypoglycemia as blood sugar levels below the normal range, generally arising as a consequence of pharma-cologic treatment. While mild hypoglycaemia usually resolves with prompt ingestion of carbohydrates, more significantly reduced glucose levels can lead to severe hy-poglycemia, in which the affected individual needs other people to help treat the event. Severe hypoglycemia leads to impaired cognitive function, loss of consciousness, and even threatens life. The link between hypoglycaemia and increased mortality has been documented in several studies.\u00b9\nZegalogue (dasiglucagon) was approved in March 2021 \nby the FDA and launched in the USA in June 2021 to treat severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes aged 6 years and older. Zegalogue reverses hypoglycemia, typically within 10 min, without the need for additional intervention, and is well tolerated.\u00b2 The drug is available in a convenient auto-injector and in a prefilled syringe, both of which can be refrigerated for up to three years or carried at room temperature for up to a year.\u00b320\nZealand Pharma  \u221e  Annual Report 2021Severe Hypoglycemia in diabetes/Zegalouge", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2021.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
