In the US alone, more than 40% of the population are considered obese.\u00b9 This is a complex metabolic disease modulated by several mo-lecular pathways; whereas single-peptide therapies have shown profound weight loss, it is expected that dual or tri-ple-peptide treatments are needed to achieve weight loss levels comparable to those seen with bariatric surgery.\nZealand is investigating both an amylin analog and a GIP \nanalog, with the potential for monotherapy or co-formu-lation with other anti-obesity peptide agents. Additionally, and in collaboration with Boehringer-Ingelheim, a GLP-1/Glucagon dual agonist is being evaluated in obese pa-tients, as well as in patients with Type 2 diabetes and in patients with NASH.23\nZealand Pharma  \u221e  Annual Report 2021Obesity / Type 2 diabetes", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2021.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
