Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a complex disease that \noccurs due to the physical loss, most often due to surgical removal, of half or more of the small intestine. As a result, individuals with SBS often have a reduced ability to absorb nutrients such as fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, trace elements and fluids, which can lead to malabsorp-tion and in more severe cases, to the need for parenteral support (PS) to maintain life. Diarrhoea, malnutrition, unintended weight loss, and a greatly reduced quality of life are all present to different degrees in affected individ-uals. Although life-saving, the provision of PS is associated with potentially life-threatening complications and poses a burden to the patients.\u00b9\nDespite the lack of a cure, the disorder usually can be \ntreated effectively in highly specialized, multi-discipli-nary centers, involving the use of agents that promote rehabilitation of the of the intestinal lining, such as GLP-2 analogs. Zealand is currently investigating glepaglutide, a soluble, long-acting GLP-2 analog, in Phase 3 studies for the treatment of SBS.24\nZealand Pharma  \u221e  Annual Report 2021Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2021.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
