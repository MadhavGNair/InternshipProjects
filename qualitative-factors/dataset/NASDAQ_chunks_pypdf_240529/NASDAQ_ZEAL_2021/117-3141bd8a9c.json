If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the fi -\nnancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\u2022\n E\nvaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents \nof the financial statements, including the note disclo -\nsures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.\u2022\n  O btain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regard -\ning the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nReport on compliance with the ESEF Regulation \nAs part of our audit of the financial statements of Zealand Pharma A/S we performed procedures to express an opin -\nion on whether the annual report for the financial year Jan -\nuary 1 \u2013 December 31, 2021 with the file name 549300ITB -\nB1ULBL4CZ12-2021-12-31-en.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electron -\nic Format (ESEF Regulation) which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report \nthat complies with the ESEF Regulation.
