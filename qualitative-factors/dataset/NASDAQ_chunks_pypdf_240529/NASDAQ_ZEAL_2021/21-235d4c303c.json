Mi-crovascular complications are still high due to an inability to optimize insulin treatment and hypoglycemia remains an important contributing factor in increased mortality.\nIt is a well-known fact that Type 1 diabetes is not a single-\n \nhormone disease, and tha\nt glucagon secretion is dys-\nfunctional in these patients. We believe that insulin-only \ntreatment approaches do not mimic physiology and that therapies should be aimed at restoring physiology through bi-hormonal supplementation. The aqueous formulation of dasiglucagon potentially renders it suitable for chron-ic administration. As such, it is being investigated for the treatment of patients with Type 1 diabetes, both as part of a Bi-Hormonal Artificial Pancreas therapy (in collaboration with BetaBionics) and as a single agent to prevent and treat exercise-induced hypoglycemia.22\nZealand Pharma  \u221e  Annual Report 2021Type 1 diabetes", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
