The new Danish regulation - Section 99d of the Danish Financial Statements Act - requires larger com-panies, which have a policy for data ethics, to supplement the management commentary of the annual report with a report on data ethics. As an innovative fast-moving fully integrated biotech company the importance of responsi-ble data sharing and data ethics is appreciated within the organization. Zealand Pharma is committed to apply data ethics that are consistent with the appropriate privacy reg-ulations and consistent with accepted industry practice. Zealand Pharma currently has policies on Data Integrity and Good Documentation that apply to the integrity and quality of data for its clinical trials and a Data Governance Manual that governs the way that certain categorires are handled and used. It is undertaking an assessment of whetether it needs to adapt these to align with this new statutory requirement.30\nZealand Pharma  \u221e  Annual Report 2021", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2021.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
