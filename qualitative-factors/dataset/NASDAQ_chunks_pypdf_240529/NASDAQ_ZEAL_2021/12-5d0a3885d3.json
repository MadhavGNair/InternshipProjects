{"page_content": "Five in 25\nOur broad pipeline provides the \npotential to build a diversified \nproduct portfolio with five \nmarketed products by 2025.The launch of Zegalogue in the US is just the first of a \nnumber of launches of new medicines expected from Zealand Pharma in the coming years. Our goal is to have five commercialized products in the US by 2025.\nZegalogue is the first product in our franchise built on \nthe dasiglucagon molecule. The next potential launch is a continuous infusion for the treatment of Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI), a rare disease with often devas-tating consequences for patients and their families. We expect our second Phase 3 trial to readout in the first half of 2022.\nWe are also planning to advance our Phase 3 trial with \ndasiglucagon used in a fully automated bi-hormonal pump, in collaboration with Beta Bionics. This \"bionic\" pancreas has been shown in Phase 2 studies to achieve low and stable levels of blood glucose levels, while reduc-ing hypoglycaemia. If successful, in its Phase 3 trial this opportunity constitutes another possibility to extend the use of dasiglucagon in the coming years.\nIn the gastrointestinal field we have the potential to launch \na new treatment for patients with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS). Glepaglutide, a long-acting GLP-2 analog, is being developed in an auto-injector with potential for weekly administration. We have completed recruitment of pa-tients into Phase 3, and we remain on track for trial results to be obtained in the third quarter of 2022.We are excited about our \nfirst independent launch \nof Zegalogue and the \npotential of having multiple \nnew product launches \nin the metabolic and \ngastrointestinal disease areas \nover the next 5 years.13\nZealand Pharma  \u221e  Annual Report 2021Five in 25", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2021.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
