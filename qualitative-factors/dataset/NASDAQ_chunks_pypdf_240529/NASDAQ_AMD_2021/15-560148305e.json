We utilize third-party risk analytics to conduct an overall supply chain risk analysis. Through our annual analysis, we gain deeper insights into inherent geographical risks in our supply chain on labor, health and \nsafety, environment, business ethics  and management \nsystems. We use the results of the analysis to assign risk assessment tools and prioritize suppliers within our  \naudit program.      \n>See our 2020 Supplier Audit Summary ResultsRESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS\nAt AMD, we respect human rights thr\noughout our compan y, \noperations and supply chain.

Tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold \n(3TG), defined as conflict minerals  under U.S. law, are used \nin everyday consumer goods and are integral to electronic products. The mining, sale and use of minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs), including the Democratic Republic of Congo and its adjoining countries, have been associated with negative social and \nenvironmental impacts.
