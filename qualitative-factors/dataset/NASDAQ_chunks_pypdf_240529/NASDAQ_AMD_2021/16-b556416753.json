Research shows that \nbusinesses with d iverse teams are more innovative, make better decisions and achieve \nhigher performance. And inclusion initiatives foster a work environment that enabl es \nall employees to participate and thrive, which in turn creates a sense of community and \npurpose \u2013 what we at AMD call \u201cbelonging . \u201d\nAs the technology industry and our role in society continue to grow, we must support \nthe next generation of innovators whose diverse backgrounds can help create \nt\nechnological solutions for some of the world\u2019s toughest challenges. In particula r,  \nBlack and Hispanic workers remai n underrepresented in the science, technolog y , \nengineering and math (STEM) workforce compared with their share of all workers. \nW\nomen are also significantly under represented in STEM occupations, making up a \nquar\nter or fewer  of workers in computing and engineering.16 While the tech sector  \nhas t\naken steps to make progress in recent years, it still has si gnificant work to do. \nA\nt AMD, we see it as a welcome challenge and meaningful opportunity to create a more \ndiver\nse workforce bolstered by a flourishing culture of belonging and inclusion.\nOUR APPR\nOACH \nWe are committed to growing diversit y, belonging and inclusion (DB&I) in our workforce to \nhelp embrace different viewpoints and experiences, foster innovation, challenge the status \nquo when needed and drive business performance. This includes increasing the percentage \nof global female hires in engineering roles and the percentage of underrepresented group \nhires within our U.S. workforce year over yea r. For 2021, we have made these efforts a \ncomponent of our company\u2019s strategic metrics and milestones to inform our incentive plan. \nUnderpinning our aspirations is a strong inclusive culture that reaches across all aspects of \nour business.\n17OUR 2025 GOAL: \n70 percent of our employees participate in AMD employee resource groups and/or \nother AMD inclusion initiatives by 202517\n16. https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/04/01/stem-jobs-see-uneven-progress-in-increasing-gender-racial-and-ethnic-diversity\n17.
