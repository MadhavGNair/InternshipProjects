{"page_content": "8DIGITAL IMPACT\nOUR 2025 GOAL:\n100 million people will benefit from AMD and AMD Foundation philanthropy and \npartnerships that enable STEM education, scientific research and the workforce of the future (2020-2025)\n1\n1. For each year during the goal period, data includes a) students, faculty or researchers with direct access to AMD-donated \ntechnology, funding or volunteers; and b) individuals with a reasonable likelihood of receiving research data formulated through AMD-donated technology and potentially gaining useful insights or knowledge.We plan to achieve our goal by fostering strategic relationships with researchers, educators \nand students that are positioned to expand horizons and develop the groundbreaking innovations of tomorrow. Whether it is donating technology to help students\u2019 sense of discovery or to help scientists responsibly push the boundaries of what is possible, we believe that when processing power meets brainpower, the future comes alive.WHY IT MATTERS  \nComputing is  ubiquitous and  more powerful than ever. Every single day, whether \nit\u2019s in the electronics we rely on at home and work, the advanced data centers and networks that connect us all, or the supercomputers used to drive research and \ninnovation in numerous fields, computing makes the previously impossible possible.   \nSemiconductor technology  creates the potential for new insights, experiences and \nsolutions with the power to transform lives and communities for the better.  For \nexample, our advances  in high-performance computing (HPC) help  society  unlock \nopportunities  around  scientific research;  science, technology, engineering and math \n(STEM)  education;  energy and climate;  healthcare;  and other exciting fields.   \nHowever, such advances also bring the potential for abuse and unintended consequences. The same technologies that promote equity and increase efficiency can also be deployed in ways that potentially disadvantage or exploit vulnerable communities or contribute to environmental degradation.\nOUR APPROACH  \nUnderstanding our  customers\u2019 and industry  partners\u2019 goals and sharing their \nvisions are critical to how we operate.  With  these insights, we can  see the \nchallenges and opportunities ahead, which  allows us to continue to develop \ngroundbreaking innovations and  help  improve lives.  However, technology alone \ncannot  achieve  societal progress.  It\u2019s the people  that put high-performance \ncomputing to work  and spark new ideas that benefit  society  as a whole.  That \nis why we  engage and collaborate with our customers, industry and other \nstakeholders to  design  world-class high-performance computing solutions \nto tackle  some of  the toughest  challenges  facing society  and mitigate  potential \nnegative impacts of technology.
