However, \nAmericans have not enjoyed these benefits equally. According \nto the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the homeownership \nrate for white households is 75%, compared to 45% for  \nBlack households, 48% for Hispanic households, and 57% for \nnon-Hispanic households of any other race.3 The disparity in homeownership rates between Black and white Americans  \nis now higher than it was in the early 1960s, before the 1968  \nFair Housing Act was passed.4 \nIn order to ensure fair credit decisions, we do not collect \ndemographic data such as race, ethnicity, national origin, or \nreligion in conducting our business or making underwriting \ndecisions. However, we do review anonymized, general \ndemographic data to inform goals and focus for our \nunderwriting guidelines.Pillar I: Strengthening Our Communities\n3.

We look at  \nthe bigger picture, always considering our customers\u2019 \nprocesses and their borrowers\u2019 experiences. In this way, we \nseek to strengthen not just our customers\u2019 business, but also \nthe neighborhoods where we live and which we serve.\nPMI provides a pathway to homeownership for families who \ndon\u2019t have the traditional 20% down payment available, \nincluding those who have traditionally been underserved by the \nbanking and credit industries. We believe that there are many \nAmericans who are left out of the dream of homeownership \nunnecessarily and should be allowed to enjoy the myriad of \nbenefits homeownership has to offer.Homeownership Rates by Race/Ethnicity4\nWhite  \nHouseholds75%\nBlack  \nHouseholds45%\nHispanic  \nHouseholds48%\nNon-Hispanic  \nHouseholds57%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACT_2022.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
