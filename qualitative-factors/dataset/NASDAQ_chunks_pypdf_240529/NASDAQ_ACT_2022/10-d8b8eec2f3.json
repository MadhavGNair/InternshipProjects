These guidelines include:\n\u2022  Allowing the use of certain positive payment histories\u2014  \nlike rent or utility payments\u2014to establish credit history.\n\u2022  Allowing a higher maximum debt-to-income ratio.\n\u2022  Offering loan-to-value (LTV) ratios up to 97%.\n\u2022  Expanded eligibility to include manufactured homes.\nBecoming the First Mortgage Insurer to Be an Annual \nPartner with the LGBTQ+ Real Estate Alliance\nAt 49.8%, the LGBTQ+ homeownership rate is far below the \n65.4% overall national rate.6 Through our partnership with the \nLGBTQ+ Real Estate Alliance (Alliance), we are enhancing our \nlearning about the challenges the LGBTQ+ community faces in \nhousing. We aim to drive acceptance through education and to \nserve as a resource for the Alliance in its mission of advocating \nfor fair housing and promoting LGBTQ+ homeownership.Empowering Sustainable Homeownership: Borrower \nand Mortgage Servicer Support and Education\nEnact provides customers (mortgage lenders) with training and \ntools to help borrowers successfully navigate the challenges of \nfirst-time homeownership. We assist borrowers and mortgage \nservicers by conducting proactive contact campaigns that \nconnect families who have fallen behind on payments to their \nmortgage servicers. In this way, we enable families to stay \ncurrent on their payments by helping to ensure that all options \nare exhausted.\nBecause our success is inextricably linked to our customers\u2019 \nand borrowers\u2019 success, we also provide exclusive programs \nthat benefit them: \nBorrower Education\nOur partnership with Finally Home! provides low- or no-cost \nhomebuyer education. The course includes seven chapters that \ncover every part of the home buying and ownership process.\nMortgage Servicer Education\nWe provide customized default management training for our \nmortgage servicers and delegate our right to the customary \nreview and approval for these options to them to enable \nborrowers in need to receive relief more promptly. In addition, in 2022, we partnered with NextJob to  \nprovide career resources to delinquent unemployed and \nunderemployed borrowers. These resources are offered to \nborrowers through their servicer, this program has no cost  \nto the borrower or servicer. \nKeeping Families in Their Homes\nOur Homeowner Assistance team helped 19,560 households \nremain in their homes in 2022. By helping these homeowners, \nwe also helped our lending partners and mortgage servicers \nwith more flexible options, including forbearances, payment \ndeferrals, and loan modifications. \n5.
