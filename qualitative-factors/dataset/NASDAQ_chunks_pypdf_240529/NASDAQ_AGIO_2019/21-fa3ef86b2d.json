Weekly internal audits are conducted to ensure compliance. \nIn addition, in 2019 a third-party environmental impact audit was \nconducted, including a review of all relevant documents and a \nfacility inspection. Agios is evaluating additional measures to reduce \nhazardous waste through improved solvent inventory, purchasing and \nrecycling practices.\nEfforts to reduce solid waste production\nAgios began our composting program in July 2019, and we have \nreplaced all paper and plastic products in our cafeteria with \ncompostable products. In the first 6 months of the program, Agios \ncomposted more than 2 tons of waste. The company currently has \nsingle-stream recycling programs and is in the process of exploring \nadditional opportunities to reduce enterprise-wide consumption of \nsingle-use plastics.\nEfforts to reduce water usage\nAgios is currently in the process of evaluating opportunities to reduce \nour water consumption. We have all new fixtures in our recently \nrenovated facilities that are efficient. We have installed water filling \nmachines to reduce single-use plastic disposable water bottles.\n22", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGIO_2019.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
