Agios \nis passionately committed to applying our leadership in the field of \ncellular metabolism to transform the lives of patients with hematologic \nmalignancies, solid tumors and rare genetic diseases. \nInspired by patients and frustrated by the limitations of conventional \napproaches to treatment, Agios pioneered a novel path to treating \ncancer and rare genetic diseases by targeting cellular metabolism. In \nour first decade, Agios brought two precision oncology medications \nfrom our own labs to patients \u2013 TIBSOVO\u00ae (ivosidenib tablets) for \nacute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with an IDH1 mutation and \nIDHIFA\u00ae (enasidenib) for AML patients with an IDH2 mutation. During ESG R eport 2020\nthat same time period, the Agios team discovered and developed six \nadditional investigational new drug (IND) candidates, including the \nfirst pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) activator in development as a potential \ntreatment for a rare hemolytic anemia known as pyruvate kinase \ndeficiency. Agios is leading the way in advancing PKR activation \nfor additional non-malignant hematologic diseases, including \nthalassemia and sickle cell disease, and the company continues to \nfoster a productive research engine that yields new insights and \npotential therapeutic approaches. Now entering our next decade, \nAgios has a differentiated portfolio of preclinical, clinical and \ncommercial programs, unparalleled expertise in cellular metabolism \nand a committed team that will continue to drive the company\u2019s \nmission to make a difference for patients.\n3", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGIO_2019.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
