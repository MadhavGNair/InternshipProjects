{"page_content": "ESG R eport 2020CASE STUDY:   \nPATIENT ACCESS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we \nquickly created a clinical trial task force to ensure the safety \nof patients on our clinical studies and to implement plans to \nenable as many patients to remain in the studies as possible. \nThe task force began meeting daily to address individual \nsituations on a patient-by-patient basis.\nIn one sample case, we worked to provide TIBSOVO\u00ae to a \nCairo-based patient enrolled in an ongoing TIBSOVO\u00ae clinical \ntrial who has been taking this medicine for four years. The \npatient typically travels to the U.S. for study visits, but shortly \nbefore the Cairo airport was shut down to help contain the \nCOVID-19 outbreak, it became clear the patient would not be \nable to make it to the study site. We urgently worked with the \nclinical trial physicians and site and approved a plan within \nhours to use a concierge-like drug delivery courier to pick up \nthe medicine from the U.S. and fly it to Egypt. As part of our \nplan, the transportation specialist hand-delivered the study \ndrug to the patient/patient representative and then boarded a \nreturn plane the day that the Cairo airport was closed. It is this \nlevel of care and urgency on behalf of patients that drives the \nAgios team every day.\n8", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGIO_2019.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
