{"page_content": "ESG R eport 2020OUR CULTURE\nOur work requires great science. But it also requires an environment where people care \u2013 about the work, about each other and about the \npeople who are counting on us the most. At Agios, we believe in our work\u2026and in each other. We approach human resources and people \ndevelopment with this in mind. We are inquisitive, data-driven and purposeful; we listen to feedback, analyze results and use the data to \ninform program improvements.\nAll of this has led us to cultivate three guiding pillars:\nPSYCHOLOGICAL \nSAFETY\nBased on research initially conducted \nby Google, we know that high-\nperforming teams exhibit psychological \nsafety \u2013 the belief that risk-taking and \nfailure won\u2019t be punished, which leads \nto more creativity and candor and \nbetter results.DELIBERATE \nDEVELOPMENT \nWe emphasize providing ongoing \nopportunities for employees to grow \nprofessionally, whether through \nbringing in external speakers, offering \npreceptorships in different departments, \nor providing stretch assignments.FLEXIBILITY\nEmployees with access to flexibility \nare happier, more engaged and more \nproductive. Flexibility is about individual \nneeds \u2013 it\u2019s not one size fits all. We \nencourage a culture that promotes \ndifferent perspectives, work styles, \nhealth & wellness, care of families and \nproductivity.\n14", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGIO_2019.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
