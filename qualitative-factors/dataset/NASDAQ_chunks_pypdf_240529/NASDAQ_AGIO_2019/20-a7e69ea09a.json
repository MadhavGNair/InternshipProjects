{"page_content": "ESG R eport 2020As part of our mission to improve the lives of patients with cancer and rare genetic diseases, Agios partners with advocacy groups on important \ninitiatives designed to offer broad and holistic support for these communities. For example, we supported the TargetCancer Foundation (TCF) \nGala, the organization\u2019s primary annual fundraiser attended by more than 300 supporters, patients, caregivers, doctors, researchers, advocacy \npartners and industry representatives. The Gala raises critical funds that directly support TCF\u2019s rare cancer research and patient support initiatives, \nas well as initiatives that engage patients in the research process and lower barriers to clinical trial participation.\nAgios\u2019 generous support helped make \nour 2019 Gala our most successful ever, \nraising over $450,000, and the success \nof that event is helping us keep our \nprograms up and running despite the \nCOVID-19 crisis. We are always thrilled \nto have Agios representatives attend the \nevent each year as well, as it is extremely \nmeaningful to have such longstanding \npartners and friends join us for such an \nimportant evening.\nJim Palma, Executive Director, TargetCancer FoundationCASE STUDY: TARGETCANCER FOUNDATION GALA\n21", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGIO_2019.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
