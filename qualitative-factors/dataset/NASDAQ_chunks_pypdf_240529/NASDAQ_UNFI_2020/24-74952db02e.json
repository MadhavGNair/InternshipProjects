Meanwhile, \nfood insecurity is an enormous problem in \nnearly every community. Food loss and waste \nalso negatively impacts our environment by \nwasting precious resources and emitting \nmethane. Food loss and waste anywhere is \nunacceptable, and we are dedicated to making \nsizeable improvements in our own operations \nso that less food is wasted.\n2020 PROGRESS\n55% OF FOOD WASTE DIVERTED \nFROM LANDFILL\nIn 2020, we\u00a0launched a cross-functional \ninternal effort to\u00a0reduce our food waste and \ndivert unsaleable food to beneficial recovery, \nwhenever\u00a0possible. This effort follows the EPA \nFood Recovery Hierarchy and aligns with the \nEPA and USDA joint goal to halve food waste \nby 2030.\u00a0Due\u00a0to the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, we \nwere unable to complete waste audits at our \ndistribution centers as we had in 2019. As \na result, we carried forward the same food \nwaste percentage estimates used in our 2019 \ncalculations. We plan\u00a0to complete additional \nwaste audits\u00a0as soon as travel restrictions \nallow,\u00a0and we can do so safely.Despite being unable to repeat our food waste \naudits at distribution centers, we\u2019re confident \nthat there is more excess and unsellable food \nthat can be rescued and diverted. Today, \nunsellable food that is diverted from the \nwaste stream is donated, sent to animal feed, \nindustrial uses, or composted, depending on \nnumerous factors. Food that is not diverted is \nsent to landfill or incineration. \nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\nIn November 2020, we joined the U.S. \nFood Loss and Waste 2030 Champions\u2013a \ncollaborative effort led by the U.S. EPA and \nUSDA. We also completed national and \nintegrated waste and recycling contracts \nearly in the 2021 fiscal year. \nOur focus in 2021 we will be on standardizing \nprograms, operating procedures, policies, \nsignage, and training our associates to drive \nimproved performance. We will continue to \nwork toward increasing source reduction and \nfood waste diversion alike to meet our new \ngoal of cutting food waste at our distribution \ncenters in half by 2025, five years ahead of the \nUN Sustainable Development goal. \nNEW GOAL\n50% reduction in distribution center food \nwaste by 2025\nFOOD WASTEMETRIC \nTONSPERCENT\nLandfill / \nIncineration13,458 45%\nRescued / Diverted 16,607 55%\nTotal 30,065 100%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_UNFI_2020.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
