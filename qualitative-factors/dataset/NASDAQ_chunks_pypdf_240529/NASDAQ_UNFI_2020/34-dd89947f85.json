Families were impacted \nbecause of job loss, children being out of \nschool, and other factors.\nTo aid in the relief, we donated more than \n$1 million to nonprofit organizations on the \nfrontlines of this work, including Feeding \nAmerica, Meals on Wheels of America, No \nKid Hungry and Food Banks Canada. We \nalso activated our network, partnering with \ncustomers in some cases to distribute food \nwhere it was needed most. Through August, \nwe had donated over 10 million pounds of food \nsince the start of the pandemic to those most \ndirectly impacted. \nIN-KIND DONATIONS\nWhen we learned of the disproportionate \nimpact the pandemic was having in tribal \ncommunities, including Navajo Nation\u2013\nwhich spans corners of New Mexico, Arizona \nand Utah\u2013we worked with our partners on \nthe ground to determine which items were \nneeded and coordinated two trailers full of \nfood and other essential items to this hard-hit \ncommunity, providing 2,000 boxes of family-\nsized portions. \nCUB COMMUNITY MARKETS\nIn July, Cub opened temporary Community \nMarkets at its Lake Street and Broadway \nlocations to address the food insecurity \nchallenges in those Minneapolis \nneighborhoods, while the permanent stores are \nunder construction. The Lake Street location \nis a temporary building in the parking lot of the \nexisting store and serves over 3,500 customers \nweekly. The Broadway temporary market is \nwithin the old building and serves over 7,000 \ncustomers weekly. Each store offers key items \nfrom all sections of the store including fresh \nproduce, meat, dairy and very importantly, a \nfull-service Pharmacy. \nFor those customers that want to shop a \ntraditional, full-size grocery store, Cub also \nlaunched a free daily dedicated coach shuttle \nfrom its Broadway store to its Crystal store and \nfrom the Lake Street store to its Quarry store.\nLearn more  about how we\u2019re supporting our \ncommunities through the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_UNFI_2020.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
