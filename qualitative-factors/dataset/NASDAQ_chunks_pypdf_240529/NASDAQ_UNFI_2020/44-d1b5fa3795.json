Fostering a culture that \ninspires and engages our people remains a top \npriority. \nIn 2020, we used new tools to conduct our \nannual engagement survey\u2013Your Voice. Our \nFuture.\u2013giving leaders and teams more insights \nand resources to identify the most impactful \napproaches to implement in the coming year. \nThis year\u2019s survey showed that many of \nour associates understand how their work \ncontributes to UNFI\u2019s success, are happy with \ntheir work teams and would recommend their \nmanagers to others. As an organization, we \nidentified three key priorities for improvement: \n1) collaboration, 2) willingness to challenge the \nstatus quo, and 3) inclusion. In addition to the \ngoals set by teams throughout the organization, \nour executive leadership has committed to a \nseries of actions to improve in these three areas.\nAPPRECIATION \nRecognizing associates for their great work \nis one of the most powerful ways we drive \nconsistently strong results. When associates \nfeel appreciated for what they do, they are more \nloyal, committed, and engaged. In 2019, we introduced our thankU program, \nwhere associates can nominate their coworkers \nfor excellent performance and alignment with \nour values. \nWarehouse Appreciation Day was organized \nby UNFI regional sales teams to recognize \nthe tremendous effort our distribution center \nassociates contributed to meet the demands of \nour customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIn each location, messages of thanks played \nover video monitors, gifts were distributed, \nand meals were enjoyed in safe, distanced \ncelebrations. \nLIVING OUR VALUES\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, \nover 1,000 associates completed a \u201cgreen\u201d \naction every day during the month of April. \nGiving back is an integral part of our culture. \nIn 2020, our communities needed our support \nmore than ever. Our associates stepped up to \nsupport community members impacted by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic through \u201cSmall Acts of \nService\u201d, including making masks, giving blood, \nand buying groceries for community members \nunable to leave their homes.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT\nWe are focused on providing many ways for \nour associates to take part in our ESG mission. \nIn 2021, we will launch a new platform to \npromote awareness of our goals and enable our \nassociates to take actions in their daily lives that \ncontribute to positive social and environmental \nchange. Topics will include environmental \nstewardship, racial justice and equity, and civic \nengagement.  \nNEW GOAL\nAssociates complete 10,000 \u2018Missions\u2019 through \nnew ESG engagement tool by 2022\nNEW GOAL\nVolunteer 200,000 hours by 2030\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_UNFI_2020.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
