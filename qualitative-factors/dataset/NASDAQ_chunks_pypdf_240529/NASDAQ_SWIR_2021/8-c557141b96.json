{"page_content": "Corporate Sustainability Program | 2021 Progress ReportOverview of 2021 Activities \nAmong other initiatives, we developed partnerships across the globe with four \nnon-profits whose missions are aligned with our values, we relaunched two \nemployee resource groups (ERGs) and debuted a third ERG, and developed firm \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets, delivering on a promise that we made \nlast year.\nBackground/Methodology\nAt Sierra Wireless, our values come from our stakeholders. We have a corporate \nsustainability team that listens to our customers and employees to understand \nwhat drives them. This helps us to build a cohesive strategy based on what\u2019s \nimportant to us and our community. The corporate sustainability team then sets \ngoals that support those values.\nHowever, values on their own are not enough. We believe that action relies on \naccountability, so we reinforce our sustainability initiatives with an organizational \nstructure that embeds our values at every layer of the organization. \nAccountability relies on transparency, so that everyone can see what we have \ncommitted to and how our actions match those commitments. This report is  \npart of that transparency. Another part is our reliance on strong partnerships  \nwith external stakeholders to help set the standard for responsible,  \nsustainable operations.Corporate Sustainability Goals\nBuild Sustainable \nCommunitiesStrengthen Diversity, \nEquity & Inclusion\nReduce Greenhouse \nGas Emissions Deploy Eco-design\nReduce Contribution \nto LandfillAccelerate Supplier \nSustainabilityCorporate Sustainability Program | 2021 Progress Report\nOur corporate sustainability team listens to our customers \nand employees to inform our sustainability goals\n8", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SWIR_2021.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
