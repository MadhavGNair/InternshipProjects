{"page_content": "Corporate Sustainability Program | 2021 Progress ReportLooking to 2022 with Optimism\nOverview\nThe most resilient companies are those that lean into challenges, finding \nopportunities for creativity and growth. During two years of global turmoil, Sierra \nWireless has been busy not just maintaining its global operations but learning \nhow to adapt as business conditions fluctuate. We have found opportunities for \nmore sustainable operations in a crisis. These include emission reductions as \noffices shrink and remote working practices increase, smart fundraising activities \nfor global causes, and a doubling down in our employee care initiatives. This enthusiasm has bought us tangible progress in our corporate sustainability \nefforts during 2021 despite significant challenges. We are now emerging \nfrom the pandemic with a clearer sustainability strategy than ever and a solid \nplatform on which to execute it. In 2022, as people adjust to a hybrid working \nenvironment, we expect to take our environmental stewardship, community \nbuilding and people-focused initiatives to new heights.\n26", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SWIR_2021.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
