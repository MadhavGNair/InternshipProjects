{"page_content": "Corporate Sustainability Program | 2021 Progress ReportMateriality Assessment \nCorporate sustainability is an evolving discipline within Sierra Wireless. We began our journey in 2017 with a quest to identify our priorities for corporate sustainability \nas an organization. It started with a foundational project involving conversations with several stakeholders in our community. This materiality assessment invited \nfeedback from employees, customers and suppliers through surveys, focus groups and, in some cases, audits. \nThat feedback helped to identify over a dozen material topics that Sierra Wireless and its community considers important. Broadly based on the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI) standards, they include: \n\u2022 Building sustainable communities \n\u2022 Creating a respectful workplace that fosters \nequal opportunity and diversity \n\u2022 Attracting top talent that will bring fresh \nperspectives and added value \n\u2022 Developing and retaining our highly  \nskilled workforce \u2022 Complying with regulations on fair \ncompetition and export controls \n\u2022 Meeting customer and regulatory \nexpectations and requirements \n\u2022 Maximizing the capability of Sierra Wireless \nto adapt to changing laws, regulations and \nstandards \n\u2022 Complying with anti-bribery, anti-corruption  \n and anti-fraud requirements, and exhibiting  \nethical behavior \n\u2022 Considering social issues associated with raw \nmaterial sourcing, and conducting appropriate \ndue diligence to understand our position in the \nsupply chain\u2022 Using eco-design concepts to create products \nwith consideration for the environmental impacts \nthroughout their lifecycle \n\u2022 Ensuring our recycling is responsible \n\u2022 Reducing our carbon and energy footprint \n\u2022 Conducting regular risk assessments, audits and \nverification of Sierra Wireless\u2019 supply chain \n\u2022 Practicing responsible sourcing and outsourcing \n\u2022 Ensuring the security of our products and servicesPeople Governance and Compliance Environment Overview of 2021 Activities \n9", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SWIR_2021.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
