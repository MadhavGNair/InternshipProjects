People \nEmployee Resource Groups\nPromoting Employee Mental Health  \nIn 2021, we relaunched our Mental Health ERG, which is focused on \nproviding resources to employees who may be struggling with various \nconcerns such as isolation, anxiety and work-life balance. \nWith the help of our mental health regional ambassadors, who \nadvocate for mental health in Canada, the US, APAC and EMEA, we \nalso launched a mental health Teams channel to support the ERG\u2019s \ninformation-sharing goals, allowing employees to exchange information \nand experiences. We use this channel to promote Wellable, an employee \nwellness platform that we use to help elevate employees\u2019 physical and \nmental health. \nCaitlin Berndt,  \nLead, Mental Health ERG\nEncouraging Young Talent  \nEmerging Professionals, our newest ERG, started late in spring 2021.  \nThe co-leaders teamed up to recruit regional leaders, developed their mission \nstatement and launched a Teams channel to facilitate engagement with its \nmembers and the broader Sierra Wireless community. The group\u2019s goal is to \nbuild a community of early career professionals including co-op students, \nconnecting people in different roles across the company. The ERG hosted \nevents in North America and two in the APAC region, including an online \nnetworking opportunity and an online career development event at which a \npanel of experienced leaders fielded questions about their career journeys. \nMoving into 2022, the Emerging Professionals ERG will be hosting bi-weekly \nonline \u2018water cooler\u2019 meetings, and will co-host a career-building event with \nthe Women\u2019s Information Network (WIN@S) ERG. \nDaniel Weiss,  \nCo-lead\nMeghan Cavers,  \nCo-lead\n18", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SWIR_2021.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
