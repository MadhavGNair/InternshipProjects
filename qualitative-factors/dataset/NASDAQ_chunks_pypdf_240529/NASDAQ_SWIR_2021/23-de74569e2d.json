{"page_content": "Setting our GHG Emissions Target \nThe Glasgow COP26 climate summit in November 2021 sounded the climate \nalarm more loudly than ever. It is clear that no company can look away from this \nglobal risk. Reducing, or at least limiting, emissions is an immediate challenge,  \nand it is one that Sierra Wireless is glad to accept. \nWe have historically tracked our GHG emissions, but in 2020, we pledged to create \nscience-based targets as part of our climate change initiative in 2021, and we \nannounced these in Q4, publishing our goal on our website and on social media. \nWe calculate our emissions in EMEA and APAC using the Responsible Business \nAlliance\u2019s GHG emissions calculator, which aligns to the GHG Protocol Corporate \nAccounting and Reporting Standard. In the US, we use the Environmental \nProtection Agency\u2019s calculator. In British Columbia, Canada, we use the Electricity \nEmission Intensity Factor published by BC\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Climate \nChange Strategy.\nWe used a fixed base year approach when creating our emissions targets,  \nbased on our emissions in 2019. We chose this, the most recent year with  \nfull data, rather than 2020, which had unusual emission rates due to the \npandemic\u2019s disruption. Theme 3.
