{"page_content": "Corporate Sustainability Program | 2021 Progress Report Theme 3. Environment\nOverview\nThe locations in which Sierra Wireless has bricks-and-mortar offices are \nsome of the most beautiful areas in the world. Perhaps this is one of the \nreasons that our employees felt so strongly about the environment when \nwe asked them about their sustainability values in 2017. We have made \nenvironmental protection and stewardship one of the key pillars of our \ncorporate sustainability initiative. In 2021 we saw a flurry of activity as we \ntook tangible steps to limit global warming and preserve our natural world.\nGreening our Supply Chain \nSierra Wireless has long been committed to supply chain sustainability, \nand each year we continue to push for more improvements in a network \nof suppliers that extends around the globe. Nevertheless, simple supplier \nmanagement was enough of a challenge in 2021. The supply chain was \nfraught at all stages, from the acquisition of components through to \noperations in third-party factories. COVID-19 lockdowns constrained \noperations in Vietnam. \nDespite these setbacks, we made progress in creating an ever-more \nsustainable, responsible and accountable supply chain. In spring 2021,  \nwe tightened our supply chain ISO processes and published a revised  \nsupplier handbook. \nWe continue to gather signed commitments to the Responsible Business \nAlliance Code of Conduct from our suppliers, which includes environmental \nprotection measures. As a fabless company we don\u2019t use any water in \nmanufacturing ourselves, and we hold our contractors to the ISO 14001 \nfamily of environmental standards, ensuring that they minimize their \noperations\u2019 effect on the natural environment.\n21", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SWIR_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
