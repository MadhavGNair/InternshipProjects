It generates 167 million kilowatt-\nhours of renewable energy per year, enough to power the equivalent of 12,700 North \nCarolina homes. And we\u2019ll finish another 17 -megawatt solar array, capable of producing \n39 million kilowatt-hours per year, later in 2015. We purchase any remaining power we \nneed from entirely clean sources located within North  C arolina.\nMaiden, North Carolina\n100% renewable since opening June 2010\nDuke Energy Carolinas \nDefault Grid MixApple Actual Renewable \nEnergy Use\nNuclear 51% PV1 19%\nCoal 38% PV2 20%\nOther 11 % Fuel Cells 37%\nRenewable <1% NC GreenPower 24%\n2014 Emissions (metric tons CO 2e/year)\nDefault Grid Emissions 92,306 Apple\u2019s Effective Emissions 0\nDuke Energy Carolinas: 2014 Statistical Supplement generation data  \nApple Energy: Actual fiscal 2014 energy data\nPrineville, Oregon\nAt our data center in Prineville, Oregon, we built a micro -hydro system that harnesses  \nthe power of water that\u2019s been flowing through local irrigation canals for over 60  y ears.  \nLocated about 25 miles west of our data center, these micro-hydro projects will generate  \n12 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy a year. To supplement this \nmicro -hydro generation, we\u2019re able to directly access enough local wind energy to \npower the entire data  center.\nPrineville, Oregon\n100% renewable since opening May 2012\nPacific Power  \nDefault Grid MixApple Actual Renewable \nEnergy Use\nCoal 65% Oregon Wind 99%\nNatural Gas 13% Utility Green 1%\nOther 13% Micro-Hydro (to come)\nRenewable 9%\n2014 Emissions (metric tons CO 2e/year)\nDefault Grid Emissions 10,393 Apple\u2019s Effective Emissions 0\nPacific Power: www.oregon.gov/energy/pages/oregons_electric_power_mix.aspx\nApple Energy: Actual fiscal 2014 energy data\n Solar Arrays + Fuel Cell Farm\nWind Power + Micro-Hydro Power", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2015.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
