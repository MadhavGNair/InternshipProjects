The overall plausi bility check addressed the following questions: \n\uf0a7 Are product LCAs referenced correctly? \n\uf0a7 Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible? \n\uf0a7 Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of \nmethodological changes as indicated by Apple?  \nThis review was done remotely. \n \n3 Findings \nPrior to this CCF review and verification 7 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44. These latest LCA studies cover products which represent in total 43,2% of the total scope 3 company carbon footprint.
