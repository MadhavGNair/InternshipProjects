So we design everything from our largest displays \nto our smallest cables to be durable and long-lasting. And we test them in our own \nReliability Testing  Lab .\nYou don\u2019t have to buy a new Apple product to have one that feels new.

That\u2019s why \nwe\u2019re committed to helping people recycle responsibly. Every Apple Retail Store in the world accepts Apple products for responsible recycling. Our Reuse and Recycling \nProgram also allows customers in several countries to bring in their older devices in \nexchange for credit toward a new model.

Since 1994, we have diverted more than 508  million   \npounds of equipment from  landfills .\n We\u2019ve set up recycling programs in  \n99 percent of the countries where we \nsell our products.99%\nApple employees conduct an audit at our partner recycling center in France, ensuring materials collected are handled properly.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2015.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
