We worked with the local utility to codevelop \na 20-megawatt solar array using C7 solar panels, a new kind of photovoltaic panel with \ncurved mirrors that concentrates sunlight. This type of solar panel is well-suited to the \nregion\u2019s bright, sunny skies. The solar array has an annual production capacity of over \n43 million kilowatt -hours of clean, renewable energy. When additional energy is needed,  \nwe use local geothermal energy purchased from the  utility or other solar  resources.\nReno, Nevada\n100% renewable since opening December 2012\nNV Energy\u2014North   \nDefault Grid MixApple Actual Renewable \nEnergy Use\nNatural Gas 48% Local Geothermal 100% \nCoal 36% (PV Forthcoming)\nOther 5%\nRenewable 11 %\n2014 Emissions (metric tons CO 2e/year)\nDefault Grid Emissions 7 ,344 Apple\u2019s Effective Emissions 0\nNV Energy: www.nvenergy.com/bill_inserts/201 5/Power-Content-North_201 5-01_web.pdf\nApple Energy: Actual fiscal 2014 energy data\nNewark, California\nOur data center in Newark, California, is powered by 100  p ercent renewable energy. \nWe hit this milestone in January 2013, when we began serving the data center with \nenergy sourced primarily from California wind power. We\u2019re acquiring this energy \ndirectly from the wholesale market through California\u2019s Direct Access  program. Late next \nyear, when our 130-megawatt solar project in Monterey County, California, comes online, we\u2019ll use Direct Access to supply power from that project directly to our data center.\nNewark, California\n100% renewable since January 2013\nPacific Gas & Electric  \nDefault Grid MixApple Actual Renewable \nEnergy Use\nNatural Gas 28% Bundled Grid  \n(mostly wind)61%\nNuclear 22%\nOther 28% Grid (mostly wind) 39%\nRenewable 22%\n2014 Emissions (metric tons CO 2e/year)\nDefault Grid Emissions 38,278 Apple\u2019s Effective Emissions 0\nPG&E: www.pgecurrents.com/201 5/01/30/pge-cuts-carbon-emissions-with-clean-energy/\nApple Energy: Actual fiscal 2014 energy dataGeothermal Power + Solar Arrays\nWind Power", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2015.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
