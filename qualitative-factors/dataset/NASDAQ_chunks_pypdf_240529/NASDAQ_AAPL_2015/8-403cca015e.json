So we look at three ways to reduce a product\u2019s energy consumption:  \nmore efficient power supplies to bring electricity from the wall to the device, more efficient  \nhardware, and smarter power management  software.\nThe cost to charge the battery \nof an iPhone 6 once a day in the U.S. is 57\u00a2 per year.\n3\nIn idle mode, Mac Pro is 68 percent more power efficient than the  \nprevious generation.\nMac mini is the world\u2019s most  \nenergy-efficient desktop computer.\n4The M8 coprocessor measures  \nmotion data more efficiently  \nfor less recharging.\nMac Pro delivers up to 7 teraflops\u2014more \nthan twice the computing power of the  \nprevious generation\u2014while consuming  half as much energy at full power.\nExceeds ENERGY STAR requirements \nby up to 7 times.\nPower used in idle mode with the \niMac display at full brightness.Amount of energy used when idle.\nPower usage in sleep mode was reduced \n97 percent compared with the first-generation 21.5-inch iMac.\nThe 21.5-inch iMac uses less energy \nthan all other computers in its class.\n5\nM8\n2x\n7x\n6w\n38w\n97%\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2015.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
