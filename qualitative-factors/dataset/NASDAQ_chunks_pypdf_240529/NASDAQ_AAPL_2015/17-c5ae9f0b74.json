{"page_content": "18\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2015 Progress Report, Covering FY2014We\u2019re conscious of how we use resources that may not be around forever. So we\u2019re \ndesigning products that use fewer materials than ever before. We\u2019ve come up with \ninnovative ways to minimize the environmental impact of our raw materials by using \nmore recycled, recyclable, and sustainable plant -based materials. And  we\u2019re striving \nto reuse as much water as we can when manufacturing our products, and in the data \ncenters that help those products and services  work.\nMaking the most of our materials.\nOver the past decade, Apple designers and engineers have continued to pioneer new \nways to build our products with less material. Manufacturing innovations such as \nunibody construction have allowed products like iPad, MacBook, MacBook  Pro, and \nMacBook  Air to become thinner while being even more resilient. Today\u2019s Mac  Pro uses \n74 percent less aluminum and steel than the previous design.
