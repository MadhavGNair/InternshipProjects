{"page_content": "20\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2015 Progress Report, Covering FY2014Amount of material recovered for reuse in 2014 in metric tons\n \nIn 2010, we set out to achieve a worldwide recycling collection rate of 70 percent \nof the total weight of the products we sold seven years earlier. Since then, we have \nconsistently reached 85  p ercent. In 2014, we collected 40,396 metric tons of e - waste \nthrough our  take-back programs. That\u2019s more than 75  percent of the total weight of \nthe products we sold seven years earlier, and significantly more than others in the \nindustry typically  report. \nWe wanted to better understand the impact of these  programs throughout the entire \nrecycling chain, so we  worked with e -waste experts to calculate how our recycling \nprograms break down into raw materials: how much aluminum, steel, and other materials from the waste we collect was recovered for reuse instead of mining more \nvirgin  material. The remaining amount of waste was processed and managed to mini -\nmize environmental  impact.\nMaterials like aluminum, steel, copper, gold, silver, and palladium need to be mined from the earth and processed, which requires extensive land use and generates \ngreenhouse gasses and other emissions. By recycling these materials, we can prevent \na significan t amount of these impacts. For example, we recovered enough steel in 2014 \nthat the equivalent could be used to build over 100  miles of railroad track. And we \nare continually investing in new ways to better reuse these materials and recover other \nrare elements.1 1 ,800\nSteel\n1 851\nAluminum5965\nPlastics\n5749\nGlass (CRT)494\nGlass (Other)3.3\nSilver\n2\nTin\n77\nCobalt\n12 97\nCopper.9\nGold\n19\nLead\n16\nNickel.3\nPalladium\n54\nZinc", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2015.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
