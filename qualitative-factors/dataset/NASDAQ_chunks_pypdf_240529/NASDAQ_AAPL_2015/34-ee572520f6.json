As is typical, these emissions are tracked separately  \nfrom our 100% renewable energy claim.Scope 2 emissions result from electricity use for facilities. In addition, Apple owned a facility in Mesa, AZ, that was operated by a supplier, which had default \ngrid emissions of 1 5 1,279 tons CO\n2e and effective emissions of 0 tons CO 2e. \nScope 3 emissions reported in this table include only those emissions associated with employee commute and business travel, calculated by employee \nmiles traveled. Scope 3 emissions associated with product life-cycle emissions are disclosed separately. \n*Based on utility-scale and regional default grid emission factors (using the most granular data set available).\n35 Environmental Responsibility Report  |  2015 Progress Report, Covering FY2014", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2015.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
