{"page_content": "24\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2015 Progress Report, Covering FY2014The worst toxic offenders.\n \nWe design our products with greener\u00a0materials.\nWe\u2019re conscious of how glass, plastic, metal, and other materials affect our products \nas well as the environment. We lead the industry in reducing or eliminating environ -\nmentally harmful substances, and we\u2019re always striving to make our products more \nenvironmentally  friendly.  \nTesting for toxins right\u00a0from the start.\nWe work closely with our suppliers to make sure our products are free from the harmful substances we specify, and we confirm it in our own Environmental Testing Lab. We \nsubmit our products\u2019 components to rigorous analysis including X -ray fluorescence \nspectroscopy, laser -induced breakdown spectroscopy, and ion  chromatography.\nWe can do a lot. But\u00a0we\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0do it\u00a0alone.\nWe\u2019ve formed our own Green Chemistry Advisory Board to stay in the forefront of identifying, minimizing, and eliminating toxins from our supply chain. We have also \nestablished a roundtable on toxins to learn from top U.S. and international NGOs how \nwe can make our products and processes even safer. We\u2019ll continue to seek out and take advantage of the best science, data, and solutions to keep both people and the \nplanet  healthy.Hg Be\nPb As PVC\nBFRs Pht\nBrominated Flame Retardants (BFRs) \nToxic compounds added to \nplastic enclosures, circuit boards, \nand connectors. Eliminated \nfrom our products in 2008.Phthalates\nUsed to soften plastics in \ncables and powercords. We finished \neliminating them from our cables \nand power cords in 2013.9Mercury\nPresent in the fluorescent\nlamps that once backlit Mac\ndisplays. Eliminated from our \ndisplays since 2009.\nLead\nFormerly used in display \nglass and solder. Phased out \ncompletely from our \nproducts in 2006.Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)\nStill widely used by other\ncompanies in computers, cables,\nand power cords. We began\nphasing out PVC in 1995.9Arsenic\nTraditionally used for clarity  \nin glass. Our display glass has \nbeen arsenic-free since 2008.Beryllium\nFound in copper alloys used to make \nconnectors and springs. iPhone 6, \niPad Air 2, and MacBook were designed \nwithout the use of beryllium.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2015.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
