{"page_content": " \n \n \n \n \n   \n CCF Review and Verification\nClient: Apple Inc. 4The methodological changes implemented with the 2014 CCF data are confirmed to lead \nto a significant improvement in terms of accuracy of the results. Inevitably this hampers the \ncomparability of 2014 results with earlier CCF data. \nThe increase in CCF scope 3 total values from 2013 to 2014 is largely due to increased \nsales. Emissions per unit sold are decreasing on a year-to-year basis.   \nAll questions raised in the course of the review were answered by Apple and related \nevidence was provided where needed.   \n \n4 Conclusions \nWe observe from year to year an improvement of the assessment approach in terms of \ngranularity of the used calculation data. This year the transportation and use phase models \nhave been enhanced, modelling the sales markets more precisely on the level of individual \ncountries. The differentiation of memory configurations for Macs and iPods introduced \nnow provides an even more accurate result for the production carbon footprint. \nFor all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worst-\ncase approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative \nestimates regarding e.g. production yield losses and recycling.   \nThe review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the CCF data level that \nindicate the scope 3 corporate carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The \nexcellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.    \n \nBerlin, April 9, 2015 \n \n  \n- Karsten Schischke -  - Marina Proske - \nFraunhofer IZM  Fraunhofer IZM \nDept.
