By 2020 there are expected to be more \nthan 50 billion connected devices, far outnumbering \nthe global population. This explosion of interconnected \ndevices will create an invisible fabric of computing \nwith the power to improve daily life in ways we have \nyet to imagine. The accelerating use of interconnected \ndevices represents a fundamental change in how we \ninteract with each other and the world around us. \nAt AMD, we are helping to power this new world. However, at the \nsame time we are also making sure we stay true to the beliefs and \npractices that have defined the company for nearly five decades.\nWhen we issued our first version of this report in 1995, it was \ntitled the \u201cAMD Environmental Report.\u201d Now our corporate \nresponsibility report covers a broad range of issues from diversity \nto labor rights, ethics, and yes, environmental stewardship. \nOne of the biggest changes over the past 20 years is how corporate \nresponsibility has become a key facet of our business strategy. \nA great example is our commitment to improve the energy \nefficiency of our APUs by a factor of 25 by 2020. Innovative \nprocessor designs that deliver improved energy efficiency are \ncritical in a world increasingly defined by harnessing the power \nof billions of connected devices to deliver breakthroughs in areas \nas diverse as healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation.\nLastly, it is also important to recognize how our commitment to corporate \nresponsibility affects our employees. As a technology company, AMD \nbelieves that employee innovations are our lifeblood. AMD employees \naround the world are motivated by working for a responsible company \nand designing products that change the world. Therefore, by helping \nothers, we are inspired to push the boundaries of what is possible. \nI\u2019m extremely proud to be a part of the team building on \nthe culture of caring and innovation that has made AMD \nan extraordinary company for the past 46 years.4 20th Anniversary Report Retrospective\n6 Turning the Page on Reporting\n7 25x20 Energy-Efficiency Goal\n8 AMD Value Chain \n12 Technology Enabling a Better World \n14 Environmental Stewardship \n16 AMD in the Community \n18 Powering Our People \n20 Global Operations Map \n22 The Future: Immersive Computing\n23 Data Table\n24 Recognitioncontents\nDR.
