{"page_content": "INTRODUCTION BY OUR DIRECTOR  \nOF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\nAfter reporting on our corporate responsibility  \n(CR) performance for 20 years, we asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201dEnabling an Energy-  \nEfficient Future \nAMD\u2019S 25X20 ENERGY-EFFICIENCY GOAL\nWorldwide, three billion personal \ncomputers use more than 1% of all \nenergy consumed annually, and 30 million \ncomputer servers use an additional 1.5% \nof all electricity consumed, at an annual \ncost of $14 billion to $18 billion.1 Creating \nenergy-efficient products is a key element \nof AMD innovation and will help stem \nthe growth in IT energy consumption.\nIn the past six years (2009-2014),  \nAMD achieved a 10-times improvement  \nin the typical-use energy efficiency of  \nour mobile processors with a combination \nof power-efficient APUs, heterogeneous \ncomputing features with energy-efficient \naccelerators, smart power management, \nand integration and miniaturization. AMD \nannounced a goal in June 2014 to deliver \na 25-times improvement in the energy \nefficiency of our APUs by 2020, or 25x20. \nIf AMD achieves our goal, our products \nwill outpace historical efficiency trend \npredictions by at least 70% from 2014 \nto 2020. That means that in 2020, an AMD-powered computer could \naccomplish a task in one-fifth of the \ntime as today\u2019s PC, while consuming on \naverage less than one-fifth the power. \nUsing a car analogy, this \nrate of improvement \nwould be like turning a \n100-horsepower car that \ngets 30 miles per gallon \n(about 13km per liter) into \na 500-horsepower car \nthat gets 150 miles per \ngallon (about 64km per \nliter) in only six years. \nThe energy-efficiency projections \nfrom our new 6th Generation \nA-Series APUs achieve 28% of AMD\u2019s \n25x20 energy-efficiency goal!\nCorporate Responsibility \nReporting: Turning the Page \nAMD APU TYPICAL-USE ENERGY EFFICIENCYTYPICAL -USE ENERGY EFFICIENCY\nYEAR OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTION\u201cTigris\u201d\u201cDanube\u201d\u201cTrinity\u201d\u201cRichland\u201d\u201cKaveri\u201d\u201cCarrizo\u201d\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\u201cLlano\u201d\n25x20\n\u201cThe thing that makes me most proud of my 20 years at AMD \nis the work we do in R &D to reduce the energy consumed by \ncomputing. It is extremely satisfying to me when I see our new \nproducts, like the 6th Generation A-Series APU, going out with \nstep function increases in battery  \nlife and energy efficiency.\u201d \nTim Mohin, Director, Corporate Responsibility\nAnytime you do something for that long, it can become routine  \nand has the chance of becoming disconnected from its core purpose. \nAnd there is nothing like a big anniversary to push ourselves to \nreconsider the fundamental reasons why we issue this report \neach year.  Revisiting these objectives can help us assess whether \nwe are on track or need to make some course corrections. \nMuch of how we report is dictated by two international standards: \nthe Global Reporting Initiative and the Dow Jones Sustainability \nIndex. These standards are lengthy and we have found that the \naudience for this level of information is quite small, yet influential. \nA key learning for us came a few years ago when we published \nour first CR summary. This condensed version was very well \nreceived, and because it was more accessible, it opened a broader \nconversation with our stakeholders. \nWe don\u2019t have all the answers, but after two decades of experience, \nwe believe there is room to improve CR reporting. We had a hunch \nwe were not alone in this conclusion, so we reached out to Business \nfor Social Responsibility (BSR) to see how other companies in our \nindustry viewed CR reporting. At the time of this writing, about a \ndozen technology firms have held one meeting and are planning the \nnext. While it is too soon to say what may come from this dialogue, \nthere is a lot of energy among these companies to explore ways to \nmake CR reporting more efficient and effective.\nPlease visit our website to keep up with our progress.\nhttp://www.amd.com/corporateresponsibility\u201cAMD\u2019s focus on improving \ntypical-use power efficiency  \nwill likely yield significant \nconsumer benefits,  \nsubstantially improving  \nreal-world battery life  \nand performance for \nmobile devices.\u201d\nDr. Jonathan Koomey, Research Fellow, \nSteyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy \nand Finance at Stanford UniversityPhil Rogers, Corporate Fellow,  \nTechnology & Engineering\n6(1) https://mitei.mit.edu/news/energy-efficient-computing \n7", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2014.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
