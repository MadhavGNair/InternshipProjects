{"page_content": "AMD looks beyond today\u2019s \nconventional technology product \ncategories to power smart, \nintuitive immersive computing \nfrom computers, servers, \nembedded devices, and the \ncloud. We\u2019re designing for the \ncomputational future, in great \ndetail and at scale for immersive \nhuman computing experiences. \nFrom natural UIs like gesture \ncontrol and facial recognition to \never-increasing visual and audio \nrealism, AMD is making the future \nof immersive computing a reality. \nAMD is investing in innovation to \ndeliver the promise of immersive \ncomputing and a smarter, more \nconnected world in an efficient and \nenvironmentally responsible manner. Advances in energy efficiency are \ndesigned to enable great performance \nwhile responsibly using power.\nOur innovative technologies enable \nsmarter, more intuitive immersive \ncomputing, whether it\u2019s audio, video, \nmultiplatform, immersive interaction, \nor managing data from the cloud.\nThe era of immersive computing is at  \nour doorstep, enabling incredibly \ncaptivating user experiences. Virtual \nReality (VR) is poised to dramatically \ntransform an array of applications, \nincluding gaming, entertainment, \neducation, social media, travel, \nmedicine, real estate, e-commerce, \nand more. Initiatives like AMD\u2019s \nLiquidVR\u2122 are ushering in a new \nrealm of smart VR technologies \ndesigned to empower developers \nand fuel better VR experiences. \nLooking Ahead: Immersive Computing\nEnabling today.  \nInspiring tomorrow.TRENDS\n50 billion devices \u2014 everything from \nwearable computers to industrial \nsensors \u2014 could be connected to the \nInternet by 2020.3 \nThese devices will generate an estimated \n40 zetabytes of data, whereas all of the \ninformation in the world today equals \nless than 1 zetabyte.4\nBy 2025, these devices will consume an \nestimated 6% of all electricity generated \nin the world.5\nThe amount of space dedicated to \nhousing this data will increase by almost \n25% from 2013 to 2018.6\nThe use of \u201csmart\u201d-enabled information \ntechnology in consumer and business \napplications could cut the projected \n2020 global greenhouse gas emissions \nby 16.5%, amounting to $1.9 trillion \nin gross energy and fuel savings and \na reduction of 9.1 gigatonnes carbon \ndioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases.7\nThe best is yet to come and the AMD team is making it possible.\n(3) http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/internet-economy-outlook-2012-highlights.pdf\n(4) http://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/digitalization-and-software/internet-of-things-facts-and-forecasts.html\n(5) http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2014/11/11/idc-amount-of-worlds-data-centers-to-start-declining-in-2017/\n(6) http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/MoreData_LessEnergy.pdf\n(7) http://gesi.org/portfolio/report/72\n22\n Key Performance Indicator  2012 2013 2014  \n Total number of employees 10,340 10,671 9,690\n Percentage of female employees 28% 28% 29%\n Worldwide injury and illness case rate  \n   (per 100 workers) 0.18 0.10 0.14  \n Employee volunteer hours 7,735 9,043 9,208\n Total revenue (in millions USD) $5,422 $5,299 $5,506\n Net loss (in millions USD) ($1,183) ($83) ($403)\n AMD Foundation giving (USD)8 $2,646,333  $234,931  $17,500\n Other cash and in-kind (USD) $560,245 $234,931 $242,053 \n Energy use (gigawatt hours \u2013 GWh) 377 338 289 \n CO2 equivalent emissions  199,979 206,477 194,331  \n   (metric tons CO2e, scope 1 & 2)  \n Water use (million liters) 868 910 790\n Wastewater discharge (million liters)9  391 235 92 \n Non-hazardous waste (metric tons) 1,730 2,049 1,670 \n Landfill diversion rate 64% 78% 74% \n Major supplier facilities that have completed  \n the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition\u2019s  \n Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) 89% 100% 100% \n Number of high-risk major supplier  \n facilities based on SAQ scores 0 0 0Environment\nSupply ChainEconomicEmployeesThe Data Behind  \nOur Corporate \nResponsibility Story2014\nDATA TABLES\n(8) AMD Foundation giving was largely suspended in 2013 due to business conditions.   \nWe have increased emphasis on donating the time and talent of our employees to continue to support local community needs.\n(9) Wastewater reduction due to water recycling and reduction projects, and through improved measurement.\n23", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2014.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
