{"page_content": "BUILDING MATERIALS\nMethanol is used to make plywood  \nand medium-density fibreboard (MDF) \nand is also an essential ingredient in \nsealants, paints and solvents.MEDICAL EQUIPMENT\nMethanol is used to make medical \nsupplies such as masks and gloves \nthat help keep front-line workers safe.\nPHARMACEUTICALS\nMethanol is used in the manufacture \nof vitamins, hormones, antibiotics, \nand other pharmaceuticals. AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURING\nMethanol is used in plastics that \nmake cars lighter and more fuel \nefficient to reduce CO\u2082 emissions. \nExamples include plastic body \npanels, dashboard foam and plastic \ngears and mouldings.MARINE FUEL\nAs a cleaner-burning marine fuel, methanol significantly \nreduces emissions of SOx by 99 per cent, NOx by 80 per \ncent, PM by 95 per cent* and CO\u2082 from combustion by  \n15 per cent.INDUSTRIAL + \nCOMMERCIAL \nAPPLICATIONS\nMethanol-fuelled \nboilers in China \ngenerate heat and \nsteam for industrial \napplications, and \nmethanol provides \na heat source \nfor commercial \napplications like kilns.\nDOMESTIC APPLICATIONS\nMethanol provides a heat source  \nfor residential applications like \ncooking stoves.Methanol \u2013 Essential for Everyday Life\nCHEMICAL END USES\nMethanol is an essential chemical \nbuilding block for hundreds of \nconsumer and industrial products, \nincluding paints, carpets, fabrics, \nbuilding materials, and a variety of \nhealth and pharmaceutical products. \nIt\u2019s also difficult to substitute based \non its unique chemistry, scale, ease \nof transport and cost.\nCLOTHING AND TEXTILES\nChemicals made with methanol \ncan extend the durability and life \nof consumer products like fleece \nclothing and carpeting. New \napplications can also make these \nproducts more easily recyclable.ENERGY-RELATED END USES\nA cleaner-burning fuel, methanol can \nhelp improve air quality by reducing \nemissions compared to traditional \nfuels such as diesel or coal. As it can \nbe made from renewable sources, \nmethanol fuel can also help society \nachieve its decarbonization goals.* NOTE  \nCompared to Tier I vessels running on \ntraditional marine fuel (heavy fuel oil).\nVEHICLE FUEL\nMethanol is used to fuel cars, buses \nand trucks that transport people \nand goods, replacing gasoline and \ndiesel. Methanol is also used as a \nfuel-additive (MTBE) to help reduce \ntail-pipe emissions.\nHIGH-TECH APPLICATIONS\nMethanol is used in technology  \nthat keeps us connected, like \nlaptops and cellphones. It is also \nused in applications that harness \nclean energy, such as solar panels \nand wind turbines.\n|  Methanex 2021 Sustainability Report6\nCEO Letter About Methanol About Methanex 2021 Highlights TCFD ESG Management Appendix", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2021.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
