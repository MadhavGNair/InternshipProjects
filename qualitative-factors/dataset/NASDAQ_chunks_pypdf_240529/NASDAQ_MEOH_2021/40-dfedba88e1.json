Our material topics remained \nunchanged from the results of our 2020 internal \nmateriality assessment. The assessment allowed \nus to identify the sustainability topics that are \nmost relevant to our business and stakeholders. \nWe sourced topics from recognized reporting \nframeworks and reviews of chemical industry peers. \nStakeholder perspectives considered included \nthose of investors, customers, team members, \ncommunities, governments, regulators and \nsupply chain partners. Our Executive Leadership \nTeam reviewed and approved the results of the \nassessment; the material topics have been covered \nin this report. We regularly review our material \nESG topics to ensure they reflect stakeholder \nexpectations and the changing business \nenvironment.
