{"page_content": "Climate change poses strategic business risks,  \nbut it also generates strategic opportunities.  \nWe monitor policy and regulatory changes, market \nand technology developments, and potential \nchanges in consumer behaviour and perceptions \nto assess the business opportunities and risks they \npresent in the global transition to a low-carbon \neconomy. In this section we describe the key  \nclimate-related opportunities we are pursuing  \nand the risks we are monitoring and mitigating,  \nin alignment with the recommendations of the  \nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. \nOur material climate-related risks are fully described  \nin the Risk Factors section of our MD&A .Transition-Related  \nOpportunities and Risks\nREGULATORY \nCLIMATE-RELATED ISSUE WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY? WHAT IS THE RISK?WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CAPITALIZE ON  \nTHE OPPORTUNITY/MITIGATE THE RISK?\nCarbon tax/ trading schemes\nUnder the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris \nAgreement, many of the countries we \noperate in have agreed to reduce GHG \nemissions and/or impose carbon taxes.  \nWe are currently subject to GHG regulations  \nin Canada, New Zealand and Chile.Carbon border adjustment mechanisms are being \nconsidered in the EU and Canada to address carbon \nleakage issues and support the competitiveness of \nEmissions Intensive Trade Exposed (EITE) industries like \nmethanol. These types of policies have the potential \nto boost our competitiveness with regions producing \nmethanol from coal or where producers are less  \ncarbon efficient.Potential for increased cost of production due to: \n \u2013Increasingly costly carbon tax/trading schemes \n(Canada, New Zealand, Chile) that could impact  \nus and/or our natural gas providers.\n \u2013Reduction in CO\u2082 emissions allowance/cap for us  \nor our natural gas providers.\n \u2013Increasing difficulty of building/permitting pipelines \ncould impact the cost to produce/transport natural \ngas, potentially impacting our production costs.\n \u2013Continued asymmetric carbon costs in regions  \nwhere we operate vs competitors could erode  \nour competitiveness.BUSINESS PROCESSES\n \u2013Model a wide range of carbon prices and \nmechanisms when forecasting revenues,  \ndemands and costs.\n \u2013Integrate carbon pricing into our internal \nApplication for Expenditure process in  \nlocations with an existing tax\n \u2013Hedge natural gas prices, up to 14 years  \nin some locations.\n \u2013Engage with governments (page 74)\nACTIVITIES\nEmissions reduction\n \u2013Plant efficiency\n \u2013CCUS\n \u2013Alternative feedstocks\nMarket development\n \u2013Marine fuel \n \u2013Passenger and cargo vehicle fuel\n \u2013Other uses Clean fuel regulations\nJurisdictions targeting reductions in the \nlifecycle emissions of liquid fuels have \nintroduced regulations such as Clean Fuel \nRegulation (Canada), Renewable Energy \nDirective II (EU), Renewable Fuel Standard \n(U.S.), Low Carbon Fuel Standard (California, \nBritish Columbia), Clean Fuel Standard (CA).Increasing demand for lower carbon methanol and \ncustomers willing to pay a premium for it strengthens \nthe business case for our company to invest in alternative \nfeedstocks or carbon-reducing technologies and leads to \nincreasing pressure on the long-run price expectations \nfor methanol. Methanol producers with existing assets \ncapable of sourcing renewable feedstocks will have a \ncompetitive advantage in such an environment. \u2013If increased demand for methanol from lower carbon \nintensity forms of production grows rapidly, it could \nlower demand for conventional methanol in North \nAmerica and Europe.\n \u2013Future growth expectations around methanol as a \nclean/low carbon fuel may be less than anticipated.\nIMO regulations\nTo reduce the shipping industry\u2019s environmental \nimpact, the International Maritime \nOrganization (IMO) has set a goal to reduce \ncarbon intensity from international shipping \nby at least 40 per cent by 2030. Stringent \nstandards are also in place limiting SOx, NOx \nand particulate matter (PM) from ships.Methanol presents a practical solution for the maritime \nindustry to meet the IMO regulation. It can be used in \nexisting diesel engines (with minor modifications) to \nlower CO\u2082 (TtW basis), NOx, SOx, and PM emissions and \nreduce lifecycle CO\u2082 emissions through the increased \nuse of low carbon intensity methanol.Methanol is one of several options being tested by \nthe shipping sector, creating the risk that maritime \ncustomers may prefer another fuel (ammonia, liquified \nnatural gas, hydrogen, renewable/bio diesel, ethanol, \netc.). Should insufficient volumes of low carbon \nmethanol be produced and/or should such methanol \nbe too expensive, the shipping industry could adopt a \ndifferent fuel.|  Methanex 2021 Sustainability Report 35\nCEO Letter About Methanol About Methanex 2021 Highlights TCFD ESG Management Appendix", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2021.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
