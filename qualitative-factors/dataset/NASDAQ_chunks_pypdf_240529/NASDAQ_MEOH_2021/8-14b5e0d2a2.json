{"page_content": "Forms of Methanol \nProduction\nWhile methanol can be produced from different \nfeedstocks and by using different energy sources,  \nthe resulting methanol is always chemically identical \nand can be used for the same applications. \nBrown Methanol: from coal, a non-renewable \nfeedstock, which is ~5 times higher in carbon \nintensity than methanol produced using  \nnatural gas.\nGrey Methanol: from natural gas, a non-  \nrenewable/fossil fuel feedstock.\nBlue Methanol: conventional methanol process  \nwith an integrated carbon capture and storage  \n(CCS) scheme.Renewable methanol can be:\n \u2013Biomethanol: from renewable natural gas \n(sourced from landfills, sewage plants or animal \nmanure farms) or biomass. Potential sustainable \nbiomass feedstocks include but are not limited to  \n(i) forestry and agricultural waste/by-products, \n(ii) municipal solid waste and (iii) black liquor \nfrom the pulp and paper industry. \n \u2013E-Methanol: from CO\u2082 captured from renewable \nsources (e.g., via bioenergy with CCS or Direct \nAir Capture) and green hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen \nproduced with renewable electricity).RENEWABLE\nNote:  To qualify as renewable, feedstocks need to be of renewable origin  \n(e.g., biomass, solar, wind, hydro, geothermal power).\nModified from: IRENA .
