{"page_content": "We believe our business should have a positive \nimpact on people\u2019s lives and we aim to be a  \ngood neighbour and valued corporate citizen by \ncreating positive and sustainable impacts in our \ncommunities. We partner and collaborate with  \nlocal and Indigenous communities on shared goals \nthat foster healthy, long-term relationships.\nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \nWe continually work to understand community \ninterests, communicate information about our \nproduct and business activities, and address any \ncommunity concerns. We do this primarily through \nCommunity Advisory Panels, as well as stakeholder \nassociations, open house days, community projects, \nseminars, community surveys and public meetings. \nCommunity Advisory Panels (CAPs) in our \nmanufacturing locations encourage communication \nand transparency between Methanex and the \ncommunity, helping us build and sustain positive, \nongoing relationships with our stakeholders. CAP meetings allow us to share information \nabout plant operations, seek input on our \ncommunity investment programs and address \nany community questions and concerns related to \nour product and operations. In 2021, we held 31 \nCAP meetings across six locations (both in person \nand virtually). Discussion topics were primarily \nrelated to COVID-19, community engagement \nprograms, turnaround planning and our efforts \nto address climate change. In 2021, we modified \nour membership requirements for our Community \nAdvisory Panel in Medicine Hat to require at least \none person who identifies as Indigenous.\nInternal policies and standards that guide  \nour engagement and communication with  \ncommunities include our Stakeholder Relation \nPolicy , which outlines principles for community \noutreach and involvement, and our Operating  \nSite Community Dialogue Standard, which  \nguides structured community dialogue with  \nneighbouring communities.Industry standards for accountability \u2013 We adhere \nto the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada\u2019s \n(CIAC) Responsible Care Accountability Code (Code) \nwhich outlines expectations for proactive community \nawareness and dialogue. The Code also requires \nmembers to engage with Indigenous communities  \nin a manner that respects their unique history, \nculture and rights. Our internal policies and \nstandards align with the new Indigenous \nCommunities Code elements.\nRespecting Indigenous cultural heritage \u2013  \nWe interact with Indigenous communities in \nNew Zealand and Canada. In our operations and \ninteractions, we aim to respect Indigenous rights \nand culture, including cultural heritage resources. \nCultural heritage resources refer to objects, sites \nor locations of cultural, historical or archaeological \nsignificance to Indigenous communities. COMMUNITY INVESTMENT \nIn addition to creating jobs and economic \nopportunities, we are committed to building \nand supporting healthy communities that are \ngreat places to live and work. Our community \ninvestments include partnering with team \nmembers through a matching grants program; \nfinancial assistance for health, safety and \nenvironmental initiatives; and support for regional \neducational development and scholarships.  \nIn 2021, Methanex donated $1.3 million and more \nthan 4,000 hours of employee time to community \nefforts around the world.Communities and \nIndigenous Rights|  Methanex 2021 Sustainability Report 58\nCEO Letter About Methanol About Methanex 2021 Highlights TCFD ESG Management Appendix", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2021.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
