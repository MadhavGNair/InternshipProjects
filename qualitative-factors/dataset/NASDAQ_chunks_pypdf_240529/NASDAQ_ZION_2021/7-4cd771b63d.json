{"page_content": "CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT   8\nCOMMUNITIES \nIn addition to supporting our clients, our bankers are active in our communities, serving on hundreds of nonprofit and \nmunicipal boards and participating in many other activities as described in the volunteerism section later in this report.\nSHAREHOLDERS\nThroughout the year, we meet with investors and actively seek their feedback on a wide variety of topics. We strive to be transparent and responsive to the varied interests of the investor community. Our virtual shareholder meetings in 2020 and 2021 gave all shareholders a convenient forum for submitting questions to management. During 2020, we also traveled in person (pre-pandemic) or virtually (during the pandemic) to see investors in 18 cities, presented at seven investor conferences, hosted nearly 70 one-on-one interactions with shareholders and other institutional investors in their offices, and held one-on-one or small group meetings with nearly 80 investors in investor conference settings. In total, we met with nearly 150 institutional investors from approximately 90 unique institutional investment firms, primarily those investing in or analyzing the common equity of the bank. The feedback received from investors and analysts at these meetings and other events is presented formally and discussed regularly in meetings with our management and board of directors.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZION_2021.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
