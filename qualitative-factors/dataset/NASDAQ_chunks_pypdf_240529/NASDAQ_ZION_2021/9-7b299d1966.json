From figuring out technology solutions and processing loans to personally calling and working with each of our clients, our employees have dedicated countless hours to serving our clients.\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\nWe believe that success requires an environment where people are respected and valued, and surrounded with a talented workforce that reflects our diverse customer base. We also believe that valuing differences extends beyond our financial centers and workplace to our relationships with the communities and clients we serve. As a company, we\u2019re determined that ours will be a workplace where we embrace differences \u2014 in points of view and in national origin, language, race, disability, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, veteran status and family structures. Our efforts include enterprise-wide and affiliate diversity, equity and inclusion councils, employee business forums, regional inclusion champions, a mental health initiative, and a broad range of employee and community events.\nThe Zions Bancorporation Code of Business Conduct and Ethics notes that all employees are responsible for providing a \npositive working environment honoring fairness and diversity.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZION_2021.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
