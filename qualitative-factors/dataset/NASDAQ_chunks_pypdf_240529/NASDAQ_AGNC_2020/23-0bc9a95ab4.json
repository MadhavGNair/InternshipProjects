Agency residential MBS create significant \nlimitations on the incorporation of ESG criteria evaluation into our investment decisioning as we receive limited \ndata on the mortgage loans underlying the securities. \nNotwithstanding these limitations, we are collaborating \nwith industry participants to increase disclosure and \nanalysis of ESG criteria, including climate change and social \nimpacts, for residential mortgage assets. \nA smaller portion of our capital is allocated to investments \nin Non-Agency residential and commercial MBS, which \nare backed by residential and commercial mortgage loans, \nrespectively, and packaged and securitized by a private \ninstitution. We typically incorporate material ESG risk \nfactors into our investment decision process for these Non-\nAgency securities.
