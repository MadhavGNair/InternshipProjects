Through our investments \nin Agency MBS, we support the residential housing \nmarket, including traditionally underserved portions \nof the housing market through affordable mortgage \nprograms including lower balance loans or high \nloan-to-value (LTV) loans, HomeReady loans, and \nRefiNow loans, as discussed on page 24. AGNC\u2019s ability to incorporate ESG criteria into our investment \ndecisioning is limited, as the Agencies, by design, \ndo not provide sufficient loan-level data regarding \nthe properties underlying the securities, to promote \nliquidity for Agency MBS pools. \nNotwithstanding these limitations, we are actively \ncollaborating with industry groups, research \norganizations, and governmental entities to increase \ndisclosure and analysis of ESG criteria, including \nclimate change and social impacts, for residential \nmortgage assets. \nA smaller portion of our capital is allocated \nto investments in non-Agency residential and \ncommercial MBS, which are backed by residential \nand commercial mortgage loans, respectively, and \npackaged and securitized by a private institution. We \ntypically incorporate material ESG risk factors into our \ninvestment decision process for these non-Agency \nsecurities.Female Male AsianBlack or African \nAmericanHispanic or \nLatinoWhiteTwo or More \nRaces\nBoard of Directors 33 % 67 % Board of Directors 0 % 22% 0% 78% 0% \nEmployee Category Employee Category\nExecutive Management 17 % 83 % Executive Management 0 % 0% 0% 100 % 0% \nNon-Executive Management 27 % 73 % Non-Executive Management 7 % 7 % 0% 87 % 0% \nProfessionals 46% 54 % Professionals 19 % 15 % 4% 50 % 12 %\nAll Other Employees 100 % 0% All Other Employees 0 % 33 % 0% 67 % 0% \nTotal 40 % 60% Total 12 % 12 % 2% 68% 6% ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGNC_2021.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
