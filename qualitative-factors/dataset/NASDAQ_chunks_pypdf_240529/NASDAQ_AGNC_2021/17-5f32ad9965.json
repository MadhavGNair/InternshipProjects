Emissions sources include \nstationary combustion and refrigerants for our Scope 1 GHG emissions \nand purchased electricity for our Scope 2 GHG emissions. Following our \nanalysis, we purchased carbon offsets to offset the entirety of our Scope \n1 GHG emissions and renewable energy certificates to offset the entirety \nof our Scope 2 GHG emissions. We intend to continue to offset our \nScope 1 and 2 emissions going forward, while also evaluating measures to \nreduce GHG emissions over time. We utilized 2019 as our baseline year, \nas it was the last full year unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe chart below shows 2019 and 2021 GHG emissions data and \naccompanying energy consumption data for our corporate offices. \nPurchased electricity comprised virtually all of AGNC\u2019s total Scope 1 \nand Scope 2 GHG emissions. AGNC began to re-open corporate offices \nin July 2021, and, as such, we anticipate that 2021 GHG emissions are \nlikely artificially low as a result.  We would expect more normalized \nlevels in 2022 following our full office opening in March 2022.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGNC_2021.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
