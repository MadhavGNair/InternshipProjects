If a potential conflict \nof interest in respect of a particular proxy situation is \nidentified, AGNC may elect to resolve it by following \nthe recommendation of a disinterested third party, by \nseeking the direction of AGNC\u2019s disinterested directors \nor, in extreme cases, by abstaining from voting.\nBusiness Ethics \nFN-AC-510a.1 Total amount of monetary losses as a \nresult of legal proceedings associated with fraud, \ninsider trading, anti-trust, anti-competitive behavior, \nmarket manipulation, malpractice, or other related \nfinancial industry laws or regulations \nAGNC did not sustain any monetary losses in the \nreporting period as a result of legal proceedings \nassociated with the conduct described.
