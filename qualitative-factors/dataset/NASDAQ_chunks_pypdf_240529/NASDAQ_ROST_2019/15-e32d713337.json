{"page_content": "Energy Efficiency in Product Transportation\nRoss does not own our fleet of trucks. However, \nbecause we know the impact of transporting our \nproducts is likely a relevant source of indirect  \nemissions, we employed several strategies in 2019  \nto make product transportation more sustainable:\nShipments were consolidated where possible  \nto reduce the number of trips to stores each day.\nApproximately 39% of our products were \nshipped by rail, which is less polluting than \nstandard ground transportation.\nOver 80% of our transportation partners \nparticipated in the SmartWay Transport \nPartnership, a U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency program that improves fuel efficiency \nand reduces air pollution.\nThe capacity of each trailer was maximized \nthrough floor-loading and removing unnecessary \npackaging, leading to fewer shipments.\nA project to optimize the delivery routes in a \nnumber of our markets resulted in a reduction  \nof more than 1.8 million over-the-road miles.\n15\n Ross Stores, Inc. 2019 Environmental Sustainability Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ROST_2019.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
