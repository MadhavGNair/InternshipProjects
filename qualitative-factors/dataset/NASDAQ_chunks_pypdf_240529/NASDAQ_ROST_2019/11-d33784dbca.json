{"page_content": "Energy Overview\nAs an off-price retailer, the majority of the GHG  \nemissions and energy consumption that we control \ncomes from electricity. In 2019 , the purchase of \nelectricity to operate our facilities represented 87% \nof our total energy consumption, as measured in \nmegawatt hours (MWh). The great majority of that \npurchased electricity was used to operate our Ross \nDress for Less and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS  stores. \n11Total Electricity Usage by Location 2019 Energy Consumption by Source\nSource\nAll Other Sources*\nTotalElectricity\nNatural Gas2019\nTotal Energy Intensity7,038 MWh\n782,662 MWh\n12.7 MWh per 1,000 sq ft679,702 MWh\n95,922 MWh2,446,927 gigajoules (GJ)\n45.6 GJ per 1,000 sq ft345,319 GJ\n25,337 GJ\n2,817,583 GJ\n*Other fuel sources include diesel, gasoline, propane, and fuel oils.Because electricity consumption is such a large  \npart of our energy usage and emissions, an \nimportant part of our GHG  management strategy \naddresses electricity use in our buildings. Our \ninvestments in lighting, heating systems, and \ninsulation have enabled us to reduce electricity \nuse, and we have teams committed to finding \nnew and better ways to achieve energy efficiency.
