{"page_content": "GHG Emissions Inventory Details \nIn this section, you will find a comprehensive GHG  \naccounting of our Scope 1 and 2 impact and a lim-\nited measurement of our Scope 3 impact. We plan \nto continue expanding our measurement capabili-\nties to further understand additional relevant Scope \n3 categories.\nOur 2019 GHG inventory was assembled in accor -\ndance with common industry standards, including \nguidelines from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, The \nClimate Registry, and the US EPA  Center for Cor -\nporate Climate Leadership. Our reported 2019 GHG  \nScope 1, 2, and 3 emissions were also verified by a \nthird party to ensure accuracy and completeness.GHG  emissions are typically reported in terms \nof metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent ( MT \nCO2e). To help organize GHG  emissions data,  \nwe applied the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s  \nscope definitions: \nScope 1: Direct emissions from sources owned \nor controlled by Ross (e.g., fuel used in company \nvehicles or burned in heating, ventilation, and air \nconditioning [ HVAC ] units for heat)\nScope 2: Emissions from the generation of \nelectricity purchased by Ross (e.g., emissions \nproduced by electric utilities)\n10Scope 3: Indirect emissions that are influenced \nby Ross activities but are generated by sources \nnot owned or controlled by Ross (e.g., business \ntravel, transportation of products, customer use  \nof merchandise)\nDue to the impact of many of the efficiency efforts \nthat we have pursued, our absolute Scope 1 and 2 \nGHG  emissions decreased by approximately 4%  \nbetween 2017 and 2019. The intensity of our Scope \n1 and 2 emissions per square foot decreased \napproximately 14% over that same period, result-\ning in a GHG  emissions intensity of 4.3 MT CO2 e \nper 1,000  square feet in 2019 .\nGHG Emissions Summary Table\nGHG Emissions Category\nTotal Scope 1 & 2\nTotal Scope 1 & 2 per 1,000 sq ft\nTotal Scope 1, 2 & 3 Scope 3 \u2013 Business Travel\nScope 3 \u2013 Fuel- and energy- \nrelated activities (not in Scope 1 & 2)Scope 1\nScope 22017 (baseline)  \nMT CO2e\n277,136\n5.0\n306,09928,963\n(Not measured)18,310\n258,8262019  \nMT CO2e\n265,686\n4.3\n325,3488,557\n51,10523,175\n242,5112019 GHG Emissions by Scope\nScope 2 \n75%Scope 1 \n7%Scope 3 \n18%\nRoss Stores, Inc. 2019 Environmental Sustainability Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ROST_2019.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
