{"page_content": "Engaging Our Colleagues & Community\nSustainability does not exist in a silo but \nchange often starts in the mind. Our network \nof Sustainability Champions takes on the \nimportant tasks of encouraging colleagues \nto engage in environmental programs, to \nidentify opportunities and, most importantly, \nto build belief that our optimism, skills and \nperseverance to make a positive change in the \nworld is the precondition to actually doing so.\nAs part of our mandatory induction program, \nMelco Orientation, we instill in our new \ncolleagues the importance of achieving our \nsustainability goals. We see each colleague \nas a facilitator of our success, not just by \nimplementing our initiatives, but also by \ncontributing ideas on how to continually \nimprove our existing approaches. \nTo keep our colleagues abreast of trends on \nthe sustainability front, we share relevant \nstories, facts, trivia, tips and suggestions \nthrough emails, discussion boards and \nshift briefings as part of our \u2018Sustainability \nThoughts\u2019 initiative. Our extensive community \nefforts have also seen our colleagues \ncollaborating with environmental organizations \nto clean up coastal areas, plant trees and run \ndonation drives and recycling campaigns.
