{"page_content": "Chemicals\nWe are keenly aware of the beneficial role \nthat cleaning products, detergents and other \nchemical-based products can play; but \nubiquitous as they are, their use can result in \nacute and chronic impacts on both human and \nplanetary health.\nWe undertook a comprehensive review of \nall our cleaning products and detergents \npurchased across our integrated resorts in \n2018, which resulted in the development \nof sustainable sourcing guidelines. These \nguidelines provide a product sustainability \nrating methodology (green, amber or red \nrating depending on sustainability attributes) \nthat clearly communicates our preference \nfor internationally-recognized, high-quality \nproducts from reputable third-party eco-\nlabels such as Green Key and Green Seal, \nwhile complying with all local regulations on \nsafety and sanitation. \nOur initial endeavors have not been without \ntheir challenges, persuading us to update \nour sustainability sourcing guidelines \nin 2019 to include a broader definition \nof chemicals including paints, coatings, \nsealants and adhesives, and to enhance the \nmethodology within any potential constraints \nand opportunities in the local markets Melco \noperates in.Our Supply Chain teams have been engaging \nchemical suppliers to find more sustainable \nalternatives and divert from toxic substances \nwhere feasible. In 2019, our Macau supply chain \nand operational teams have made significant \nadvancement in progressively phasing out red \nchemical products and replacing them with \namber or green alternatives as part of our \nbiannual tender renewal process. Our City of \nDreams Manila Supply Chain team reviewed all \ncleaning products and detergents, prioritizing \nthe phase-out of high-spend red products and \nreplacing them with eco-labelled alternatives, \nwhich altogether had accounted for more than \n40% of our total spend on cleaning products \nand detergents in Manila in 2018.\nLooking ahead, we are planning to identify \nadditional opportunities to transition from \namber products to green products by \ncollaborating closely with our strategic \nchemical suppliers. We will also expand the \nscope of our program to chemical products \npurchased by contractors on our behalf, such \nas paints and coatings during the design \nand construction of new buildings (more \ninformation is provided in the \u2018 Sustainable \nBuildings \u2019 section).Green Key defines best practices in \nthe hospitality sector on environmental \nstewardship. With regards to chemical \nmanagement, Green Key promotes the use of \neco-labelled cleaning products and detergents \nand prohibits several toxic and harmful \nsubstances as part of its Green Key Blacklist. \nIn 2019, all our hotels in Macau received Green \nKey awards, demonstrating our commitment \nto minimize our environmental footprint and to \nsource more sustainable chemical products.  \nCASE STUDY\nGREEN KEY HOTEL \nCERTIFICATION, MACAU \nHOTELSSUSTAINABLE \nSOURCING\nMESSAGE FROM OUR \nCHAIRMAN AND CEOOUR STRATEGYCONTENTS AND \nABOUT THIS REPORTGOVERNANCE \nAND ETHICSRESPONSIBLE \nGAMINGENVIRONMENT\n PEOPLESOCIETY \nAND COMMUNITYABOUT MELCO GRI CONTENT INDEX\n77ENVIRONMENT \u2192 2019 HIGHLIGHTS \u2192  A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE \u2192  CATALYZING ON PROGRESS \u2192  CARBON NEUTRAL RESORTS & CLIMATE RESILIENCE \u2192  ZERO WASTE RESORTS & CIRCULAR ECONOMY \u2192  SUSTAINABLE SOURCING   \n\u2192 KEY PARTNERS & COLLABORATORS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MLCO_2019.pdf", "page": 77, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
