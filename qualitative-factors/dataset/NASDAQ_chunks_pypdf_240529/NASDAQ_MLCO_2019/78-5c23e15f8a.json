{"page_content": "Seafood\nBy making informed decisions when purchasing \nfrom sustainable fisheries and farms, we not \nonly play a role in the responsible management \nof fish stocks and ocean restoration, but we \nalso work to preserve marine ecosystems and \nthe livelihoods of communities that depend \non them. We are not shy to admit that when \nit comes to procuring seafood responsibly, we \nhave found inspiration from our peers to make \nsignificant step-changes. \nOur efforts towards sustainably sourcing \nseafood in 2019 were devoted to conducting \na comprehensive assessment to understand \nthe risks associated with the seafood that \nwe purchased in 2018. Evaluation criteria \nconsidered major threats to the seafood \nindustry, including issues such as species \nconservation status, risk of illegal, unreported \nand unregulated (IUU) fishing, traceability, \nand ecosystem degradation. We referenced \nscientific research and recommendations \nfrom the Convention on International Trade \nin Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and \nFlora (CITES) and the International Union for \nConservation of Nature (IUCN), as well as the \nWorld Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)\u2019s Seafood \nGuide in our assessment to rank each species \nas either Green (recommended) or Red (avoid).\nThrough this assessment, hotspots and \nimmediate as well as medium-term opportunities \nhave been identified. Results are informing the development of a sustainable sourcing \nstrategy that aims to increase procurement of \nresponsibly-sourced seafood at our resorts \nand provide support to fisheries or farms \nworking on fishery improvement projects (FIPs) \nor aquaculture improvement projects (AIPs). \nOur current sustainable sourcing guidelines \noutline our preference for Marine Stewardship \nCouncil (MSC), Aquaculture Stewardship \nCouncil (ASC) or Best Aquaculture Practices \n(BAP) certified seafood. We also provided MSC \nchain-of-custody training to our supply chain \nand restaurant colleagues and 20 supplier \nrepresentatives in early 2019 to support our \nefforts.\n10% and 15%, respectively, of our seafood \nspend at our Manila and Macau resorts in 2019 \nwas certified to one of the above eco-labels. \nWe also identified a plan to move towards \nincreasing this contribution to a further 20 \nto 40% of our spend in Macau and Manila, \nrespectively, based on sources available in \nthose markets. As we increase our sourcing \nof seafood that is certified to credible eco-\nlabels, we are engaging our suppliers to \nintegrate chain-of-custody requirements \ninto the procurement process and along the  \nsupply chain.\nDespite the challenge of shark fin traditionally \nbeing perceived as a Chinese delicacy, we \nrecognize the impact of the trade on shark \nspecies, which are critical to the health of the planet. We therefore took the step to \nremove shark fin completely from all menus \nof our self-operated restaurants and provided \ntraining to our F&B colleagues to ensure they \noffer alternatives to our guests. We are also \ncontinuing our work with our F&B tenants to \nminimize shark-fin consumption across all of \nour resorts. \nGoing forward, we aim to confirm our baseline \nand targets for sustainable seafood by \n2020, following the implementation of a new \nprocurement system across all resorts. We \nwill also be embedding new data requirements \nfor our seafood suppliers as new seafood \ncontracts are awarded in the coming years to \nensure we have better visibility over where our \nseafood comes from. \nOur initial work has seen Melco increase \nsustainable seafood purchases substantially. \nTo support our culinary and supply chain \nteams, and seafood suppliers with particular \nefforts with local SME suppliers, we have \nalso identified medium-term opportunities. \nThis includes developing specific training and \nawareness courses on sustainable sourcing \nthat further deepen our partnerships and build \nbridges from where we are to where we should \nbe for protection of life underwater.SUSTAINABLE \nSOURCING\nMESSAGE FROM OUR \nCHAIRMAN AND CEOOUR STRATEGYCONTENTS AND \nABOUT THIS REPORTGOVERNANCE \nAND ETHICSRESPONSIBLE \nGAMINGENVIRONMENT\n PEOPLESOCIETY \nAND COMMUNITYABOUT MELCO GRI CONTENT INDEX\n78ENVIRONMENT \u2192 2019 HIGHLIGHTS \u2192  A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE \u2192  CATALYZING ON PROGRESS \u2192  CARBON NEUTRAL RESORTS & CLIMATE RESILIENCE \u2192  ZERO WASTE RESORTS & CIRCULAR ECONOMY \u2192  SUSTAINABLE SOURCING   \n\u2192 KEY PARTNERS & COLLABORATORS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MLCO_2019.pdf", "page": 78, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
