{"page_content": "Raising Concerns\nWe provide multiple channels for our colleagues \nto raise concerns about any potential violation \nof the Code or wrongdoing. We do not permit \nretaliation of any kind against any employee \nwho in good faith reports actual or suspected \nviolations of the Code or other wrongdoing. \nAny colleagues who knowingly provide false \ninformation may be subject to the usual \ndisciplinary procedures. \nOur colleagues and other persons, including \nbut not limited to customers, suppliers and \nother business partners, can report potential \nallegations via the anonymous whistleblowing \nhotline managed by an external party, or through \ninternal channels, such as their immediate \nsupervisor, the Ethical Business Liaison Officers, \nor any Human Resources team member. For \nexample, Melco receives approximately fifteen \nreports a quarter via the whistleblower hotline \nand alleged issues range from potential instances \nof collusion with suppliers or contractors to tip-\noffs regarding guests. Whistleblower reports \nare investigated by Human Resources or the \nInvestigations Department, as appropriate, and \nare reported by the Ethical Business Advisor \nto the Audit and Risk Committee on a quarterly \nbasis. Details of our whistleblowing channels \nare discussed at the corporate governance \norientation, and are available on our intranet and \nposted within key employee areas of our resorts.ETHICS\nWorking with Suppliers & Partners\nOur Code of Conduct for Suppliers (Supplier \nCode) sets our expectations for our suppliers. \nIt not only requires suppliers to meet all \napplicable legal requirements, but also our \nethical, anti-corruption, data privacy and \nsecurity, human and labor rights, health \nand safety and environmental standards. All \nsuppliers acknowledge acceptance of the \nSupplier Code and we provide training and \nregularly engage with our suppliers directly to \nassess performance. In 2020, we will share a \ndetailed questionnaire with our suppliers as a \nfirst step towards reinforcing our requirements \nand expectations. This will additionally deepen \nour focus on sustainable sourcing, and in \nparticular bring new attention to the ethical \ntreatment of animals and practices adopted \nto prevent and eradicate all forms of human \ntrafficking and forced and child labor in the \nsupply chain.\nMESSAGE FROM OUR \nCHAIRMAN AND CEOCONTENTS AND \nABOUT THIS REPORTOUR STRATEGYGOVERNANCE \nAND ETHICSRESPONSIBLE \nGAMINGENVIRONMENT PEOPLESOCIETY \nAND COMMUNITYABOUT MELCO GRI CONTENT INDEX\n3535 GOVERNANCE & ETHICS  \u2192 2019 HIGHLIGHTS \u2192 SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE \u2192 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY \u2192 RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES \u2192 ETHICS  \u2192 DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MLCO_2019.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
