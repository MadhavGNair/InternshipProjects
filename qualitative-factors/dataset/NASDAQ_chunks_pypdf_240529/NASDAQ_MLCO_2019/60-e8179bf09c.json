While \nreductions in electricity consumption were \nachieved in 2019, and 92% of our total GHG \nemissions arise from purchased electricity \nconsumption, they were offset by an increase \nin Scope 1 emissions from acquired vehicles \nand increased use of cooling systems. Overall GHG intensity at the group level decreased by \n1.6%, primarily as a result of reduced electricity \nconsumption and efficiency measures applied \nacross a greater floor area with the inclusion \nof the Hyatt Regency Hotel at City of Dreams \nManila and additional corporate offices in \nHong Kong, Japan and Taiwan. \nFour of our resorts, namely City of Dreams, \nStudio City, Altira Macau and City of Dreams \nManila, and our Mocha Clubs, account for over \n95% of our group\u2019s total emissions in 2019. \nAcross these operations, emissions decreased \nby 1.5% in absolute terms and by 2.9% in \nintensity terms, on a normalized basis based \non the properties\u2019 floor area.
