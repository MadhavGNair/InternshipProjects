We surpass \nregulatory requirements for operators to \ndisplay RG information for our guests in our \nresorts, and we actively engage people in our \ncommunities on the subject. \nTelevised Public Service Commercial in Macau\nMelco partnered with a local production \ncompany in Macau to produce a television \ncommercial raising awareness of RG. The \ncommercial was aired on Teledifus\u00e3o de \nMacau (TDM) during primetime viewing hours. \nMelco is the only casino operator in Macau to \nsponsor, produce and televise a public service \nvideo on RG in this way. \nResponsible Gaming Workshops\nTo allow our message on RG to reach a diverse \nspectrum of audiences, we pioneered a series \nof RG workshops targeted at women in 2018. \nTo encourage participation, the RG curriculum \nis interwoven with lifestyle topics. This year, \nMelco conducted five, three-hour workshops \nin partnership with a local NGO, Gaming \nEmployees Home of Macau, on lifestyle topics \nsuch as dessert making, health and fitness, \nand so on, providing comfortable settings to \nhave conversations about RG.COMMUNITY \nENGAGEMENT\nPromoting Positive Gaming Attitudes \nA microfilm was created to instill positive \nvalues in gaming practitioners, in particular \nthe dealer segment of the workforce. Using \na movie as a medium to engage audiences \nwas an innovative approach in RG. Melco \nsupported the project financially and helped \nwith story production, scripting and provision \nof shooting locations. This microfilm received \ntremendous recognition from the community \nand the Macau government.\nCollaboration with Universities and \nResearch Institutes\nMelco continues to support gaming research \nand education; we donated US$650,000 \ntowards research on RG \u2014 establishing a \nResearch Centre with Macao Polytechnic \nInstitute, and supporting the University of \nMacau\u2019s Institute for the Study of Commercial \nGaming (ISCG). \nTo build a healthier and more viable society, Melco\u2019s Cyprus operations collaborated with the \nNational Betting Authority and the Cyprus Gaming and Casino Supervision Commission, to \norganize a range of public awareness-raising events during Responsible Gaming Awareness \nWeek (RGAW). Our Cyprus colleagues gave presentations, conducted workshops and hosted \noutdoor RG information stations, which were attended by regulators, government representatives, \ncommunity members and our colleagues in Cyprus. \nCASE STUDY\nRG AWARENESS WEEK IN CYPRUS OUR STRATEGY\nRESPONSIBLE \nGAMING\n44RESPONSIBLE GAMING \u2192 2019 HIGHLIGHTS \u2192 THE INDUSTRY LEADER IN RESPONSIBLE GAMING \u2192 SYSTEMS FOR SUCCESS \u2192 TECHNOLOGY & PROCESS \u2192 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  \u2192 COLLEAGUE EDUCATION  \n\u2192 KEY PARTNERS & COLLABORATORS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MLCO_2019.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
