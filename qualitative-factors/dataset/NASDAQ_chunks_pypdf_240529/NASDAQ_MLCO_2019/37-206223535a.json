{"page_content": "DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY\nColleague Training & Awareness \nOur colleagues play an important role to \nensure data privacy and security. When it \ncomes to cyber threats, human error can be an \nunderlying area of vulnerability with focused \nstrikes on colleagues via phishing (or whaling \nwhich often targets senior executives). As \na result, information security is part of our \nCode, our corporate governance policies and \nour training for all colleagues, at all levels of \nthe Company. We regularly update employee \nguidelines on data protection in our respective \nregions and run awareness campaigns about \nphishing attacks. We regularly assess if \nadditional training is required and, in 2019, we \nreleased further guidance on personal data \nretention through circulation of the corporate \npolicy and guidelines on data privacy and \ndocument retention. \nWorking with Suppliers & Partners\nOur security risks are not limited to our \nsystems. They are extended to the systems \nand processes of our partners and suppliers. \nIn our partner and supplier selection \nprocesses, cybersecurity requirements and \nongoing testing are required. Vendors who \nfail to meet our high standards are notified \nand all IT providers must comply with the ISO \n27001 standard. We also work with partners to \nshare information on cybersecurity threats and \nhacker tactics.DATA PRIVACY  \n& SECURITY\nMESSAGE FROM OUR \nCHAIRMAN AND CEOCONTENTS AND \nABOUT THIS REPORTOUR STRATEGYGOVERNANCE \nAND ETHICSRESPONSIBLE \nGAMINGENVIRONMENT PEOPLESOCIETY \nAND COMMUNITYABOUT MELCO GRI CONTENT INDEX\n3737 GOVERNANCE & ETHICS  \u2192 2019 HIGHLIGHTS \u2192 SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE \u2192 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY \u2192 RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES \u2192 ETHICS \u2192 DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MLCO_2019.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
