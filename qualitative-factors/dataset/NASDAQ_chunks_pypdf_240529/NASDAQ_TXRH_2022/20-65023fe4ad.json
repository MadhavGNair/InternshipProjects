They have an ownership \nmentality because a large part of their compensation \nis based on the success of the restaurant. One of our \nManaging Partners said it best, \u201cOther companies teach \nyou how to run a restaurant, but Texas Roadhouse \nteaches you how to own  a restaurant. \u201d\nWe believe the ancillary benefit of this is that they \nare also incentivized to control waste and be good \nstewards of their resources, which is a key driver of our \nsustainability efforts. For example, having in-house \nMeat Cutters provides higher-quality steaks to our \nguests and helps to reduce millions of pounds of food \nwaste each year.\nSharing the Love: Profit Sharing Program\nFrom Kitchen Managers to Service Managers to Support \nCenter employees to our Executive Team, we share \nthe profits of our restaurants with employees at many \nlevels. We give stock to thousands of our employees \nevery quarter. We are proud of our approach to \ncompensation, as we believe having \u201cskin in the game\u201d \nkeeps us committed to our mission of Legendary Food \nand Legendary Service every day.\nManaging Partners and Market Partners are required, \nas a condition of employment, to sign a multi-year \nemployment agreement.
