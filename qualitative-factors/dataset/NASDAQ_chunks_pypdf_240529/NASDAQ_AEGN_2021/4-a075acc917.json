{"page_content": "3 \nIntroduction\nGrowth and interest in responsible \ninvesting continued as we all faced \nup to the impact we are having on our \nplanet. \nA focal point for much of this \ninterest was COP26 held in Glasgow \nin November, as world leaders and \ndelegates gathered to assess the \nimpact of climate change and agree on \nmeasures aimed at limiting its damage. \nMany found the outcome disappointing \nfollowing lack of agreement over how \nto tackle the issues faced. But some \nhope was found in the reaction and \nclear collaboration of many smaller \norganizations and groups that aim to \nhelp fight climate change. \nFurther hope for a brighter future \nwas offered by the mass rollout of \nthe various Covid-19 vaccines across \nthe world. This allowed a return to \nsome normality and for economies to \nbegin reopening and markets to start \nrecovering. One by-product of this \nwas inflation, which at first appeared \ntransient but is now proving stickier \nthan first thought. \nAs we return to some semblance of \nour regular routines, I have no doubt \nthe pandemic has changed the way \nwe spend our time and money. But \nother things remain unchanged such \nas the continued migrant crisis, which \ncontinues to underline the importance of meeting the UN\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.10 \nThese events lead us to an inescapable \nconclusion: environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) issues are here to \nstay and will continue to influence \nsocieties, markets and valuations. This \nis why at Aegon AM, we continue to \npursue our goal of capturing ESG value \nand risk, while aiming to contribute to a \nmore sustainable world. \nIn 2022, we look forward to continuing \nour responsible investment journey by \nlaunching innovative strategies and \nfurther developing our ESG integration \nprocesses, particularly in more \nchallenging asset classes where ESG \ninformation is difficult to procure. We \nwill also continue to seek to achieve \nthe greatest impact for our institutional \ninvestors, as active and engaged \nowners of corporate balance sheets. \nThe coming year will surely bring both \nchallenges and opportunities, but we \nremain committed to providing a more \nsustainable future for our clients.Brunno Maradei, CFA, Global Head of \nResponsible Investment\nIntroductionESG issues are here \nto stay and will \ncontinue to influence \nsocieties, markets \nand valuations.
