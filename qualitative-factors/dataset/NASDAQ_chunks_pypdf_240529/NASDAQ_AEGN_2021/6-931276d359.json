{"page_content": "In 2021 we introduced new sovereign \nbond ESG categories to assess \ninvestment potential. Sovereign bonds \nare difficult to assess, given their \ncomplex social, economic, political and \ngeographic makeup. This complexity \nmakes them inherently complicated \nfrom an ESG perspective as it builds on \nan already-challenging typical sovereign \nassessment. This is partly due to \nlimited data and lack of consistency in \ndefining and measuring ESG factors, \nas well as an understanding that more \nthan raw data is needed. \nSocial unrest, political and economic \nstability, and the impact of climate \nchange all play a role in an issuer\u2019s \nability and willingness to pay its debt. \nIt thus requires a dedicated team to \nanalyze both the quantitative and \nqualitative aspects of sovereigns in an \neffort to ensure proper understanding \nof each country. At Aegon AM, our \nefforts in this regard are guided by our \nexperienced sovereign research team. \nFactors to consider in sovereign \nbonds  \nWe believe responsible investing in \nsovereign debt requires an additional \nset of tools beyond traditional portfolio \nmanagement practices. Our sovereign \nresearch team uses a comprehensive \nframework to provide a tailored \napproach. \nImportant factors we consider are: \n\u2022 Data is not exact: Quantitative \nmeasures are not always reliable. \n\u2022 Trends are key: Rather than looking \nat specific measures, watching the \ndirection of a country\u2019s movements is \nessential.\u2022 Politics and policy: Government \npolicy is critical but can be prone \nto fluctuations due to changes in \nleadership. Monitoring politics is \nessential. \n\u2022 Unique attributes: Economics, \ngeopolitics, climate, weather and \ngeography must be taken into \nconsideration. \n\u2022 Longer time horizons: Relevant \ntime periods differ for sovereigns \ncompared to corporate issuers. \nCorporations are more nimble, short-\nterm profit-oriented, and can change \npolicy more quickly than a sovereign \nissuer. Changes to sovereigns can \ntake generations to occur, often \nthrough various economic and \npolitical cycles. \nAn ESG framework that supports \nqualitative research  \nThese factors led us to develop a \nproprietary ESG scoring methodology \nto support our qualitative research \nprocess. This ESG calculator collates \nmultiple data sources to identify \nmaterial ESG factors and the level \nof risk a country faces considering \nits development profile. The result \nis a proprietary ESG score for each \nsovereign, which can help contextualize \nongoing ESG issues and their \nmateriality, as well as recent ESG trends \nin that country. This information is \nthen used as an input to our qualitative \nESG research integration process, \nwhich underpins our sovereign ESG \nassessments. New responsible investment capabilities: \nEnhancing the ESG integration process in \nsovereign bond investing \nWe believe \nresponsible investing \nin sovereign debt \nrequires an additional \nset of tools beyond \ntraditional portfolio \nmanagement \npractices. \nNew responsible investment capabilities5Alan Buss, CFA, Senior Sovereign \nAnalyst\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2021.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
