{"page_content": "In 2021 Aegon AM NL \ntransitioned the AEAM Global \nReal Estate Strategy to AEAM \nGlobal Sustainable Real Estate \nStrategy15 \nThe reason for the transition to a \nsustainable mandate is that we believe \ninvesting responsibly in real estate \nmatters. The building and construction \nindustry accounts for roughly 36% of \nglobal final energy consumption and \n37% of energy-related carbon dioxide \nemissions (2020). Building stock is \nexpected to double in Africa and Asia \nby 2050, with global material use \nexpected to double by 2060. A third \nof that is attributable to the building \nand construction sector.16 Responsible \nchoices could go a long way to \nmitigating some of the environmental \nimpact of the sector. \nAt Aegon AM we believe an investment\u2019s \nrisk/return profile can benefit from a \nsustainable investment strategy. In real \nestate we see two areas where risk can \npotentially be mitigated: \n\u2022 Increasing regulation and carbon taxes \ngive rise to transition risk for property \nportfolios (capex/ stranded assets) \n\u2022 Physical risks are also increasingly \nconsidered by investors and valuers \ndue to more frequent and extreme \nclimate events \nOn the positive side, there is tenant \ndemand for green buildings, which \nbenefits occupancy rates and rental \nlevels for portfolios adapted to future \nenvironmental standards, while hidden \ncapex risks decline, benefitting returns. \nThere are, however, no shortcuts \nin aligning global listed real estate \nportfolios with sustainability trends. A \nmagic number is not always available \nand the quality of the available data \nis often mixed. For example, it might \nopportunistically focus on only a part of \nthe portfolio, or it may not reflect the life cycle impact of the assets. Assessing \na strategy or environmental target might \nrequire a deeper dive into the fine print. \nAdditionally, differences in regulation, \nphase of development and local climate, \nlimits comparability between portfolios \nworldwide. \nWe have addressed these challenges \nby following a bottom-up and thorough \nsustainability research approach that \nwe use for our other single asset \nsustainable strategies, which is also \napplied to the Aegon Sustainable \nDiversified Growth strategy17 detailed \npreviously. This approach looks at the \nvarious aspects most relevant to each \nsubsector and region. In certain cases, \nthe direction and rate of change may be \nmore important. \nThis approach follows the framework \nof Aegon AM sustainability research \nadapted to real estate. This includes an \nanalysis of how a product contributes \nto the world and how the company \nconducts its business. To secure \nconsistency, quality and governance \nover the process, all our sustainability \nresearch is subject to independent \nscrutiny and validation. The outcomes \nare twofold. Input for engagement \nproviding a valuable feedback loop to \nthe corporate, and the categorization \nof our investment universe into leader, \nimprover or laggard, which serves as \ninput for the portfolio construction \nprocess. \nThe saying \u201cthe greenest building is the \none never built\u201d might sound cynical \nbut holds some truth. When looking at \nthe life cycle analysis, a lot of pollution \ncomes from the construction and \ndemolishment phases of buildings\u2014\ntypically areas where data is missing. Our \napproach to real estate sustainability \nincludes this life cycle aspect and is \nforward-looking and flexible in an effort \nto support the sustainability ambitions \nfor the strategy and ultimately our \nclients.\nNew responsible investment capabilities9New responsible investment capabilities: \nGlobal Sustainable Real Estate \nBoudewijn Schoon, Senior \nPortfolio Manager Listed Real \nEstate\n15Advised or sub-advised by Aegon AM NL.
