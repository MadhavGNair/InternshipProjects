{"page_content": "Similar to engagement, our voting \nactivities seek to ensure that our voice \nas investors is heard, in an effort to \nimprove companies' performance and \nto pursue competitive returns for our \nclients. Our approach to voting is also \ninformed by engagement.\nIn 2021, we voted on 2,963 meetings \nglobally, up from 2,511 in 2020 and \n2,321 in 2019. Votes cast spanned \nmultiple regions and countries across \nEurope, North America, Asia and \nAustralia. The nation where we voted \nin most was the United States, with \n30% of the overall number of meetings \nworldwide. \nIn the event Aegon AM casts a vote \nagainst or withholds a vote on a \nmanagement proposal, we are prepared \nto explain the reasons for this voting behavior to the company's board either \npro-actively or per company request. As \nwith the votes against management, \nmost of the shareholder proposals \nwe supported related to directors (i.e., \nelection). \nAegon AM votes in accordance with \nthe principles outlined in its Active \nOwnership Policy.22 It is supported by \nmore detailed local policies in the US \nand the Netherlands, as well as client \nvoting policies. To the extent that the \nActive Ownership Policy is inconsistent \nwith an Aegon AM affiliate\u2019s local \nlegal requirements, that affiliate will \nadhere to its local requirements. Voting \npolicies are reviewed regularly to ensure \nthey reflect new regulations and the \nlatest developments in the investment \nindustry.\nCapitalization 10%Routine/business 6%\nAnti-takeover related 1%Non-salary comp 23%Reorg and mergers 3%\nOther/Misc <1%Directors related 57%\nCorp governance 5%Routine/business 13%\nHealth/environment 11%Compensation 7%Social/human rights 1%\nOther/misc 14%\nSocial proposal 2%Directors related 47%\nBreakdown of votes against management proposals23\nBreakdown of votes on supported shareholder proposals23\nAll data as of December 31, 2021.  \n22Active Ownership Policy available at: https://www.aegonam.com/globalassets/aam/responsible-investment/\ndocuments/aegon-am-active-ownership-policy.pdf\n23Breakdown of votes cast primarily reflects voting activity for Aegon AM UK and Aegon AM NL.  \nPercentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.19Voting \nVoting", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2021.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
