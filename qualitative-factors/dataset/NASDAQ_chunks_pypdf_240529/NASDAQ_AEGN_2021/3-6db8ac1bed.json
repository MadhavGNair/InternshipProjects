{"page_content": " \nForeword\nThe last year proved to be another \nchallenging period as we all continued \nto live with Covid-19. However, the \nrollout of the vaccination programs \nworldwide brought hope of a return to \nsome measure of normality. Despite the \nemergence of the Delta and Omicron \nvariants, economies began to reopen, \nand we face a far more optimistic \nfuture as we look forward to the rest of \n2022. \nThe pandemic forced the world to \nadapt to the changing environment \nmore quickly than anyone could \nhave expected, with people pulling \ntogether for the greater good. This was \nparticularly visible in medical and care \nprofessionals, as well as with essential \nworkers who continued to selflessly \nput their own wellbeing at risk. At an \neconomic level central banks across \nthe world moved rapidly to dampen \nthe economic repercussions of the \npandemic. \nCovid-19's disruption to the world's \npredictable cycles caused a collective \nreassessment of the normalcy and \nroutine of our daily lives with priorities \nshifting. It has also seen investors \nbegin to place greater emphasis on the \nimportance of environmental, social \nand corporate governance issues.\nAt Aegon Asset Management (Aegon \nAM) our daily life may look a little \ndifferent, but our commitments \nremain the same: to deliver the \nhighest quality investment solutions to our clients; pursue competitive \nlong-term results through active \ninvestment management; and provide \nour employees with fulfilling careers, \nfinancial stability, and a safe, inclusive \nand diverse workplace. \nAs part of our commitment to inclusion \nand diversity we aspired to have 30% \nof senior management roles globally \nfilled by women by the end of 2020. \nWe beat that target and hit 33% in \n2021. However, we don\u2019t want to stop \nthere. We are continuing to push for \nprogress, and our aspiration is to have \nwomen comprising 35% of the firm\u2019s \nsenior management positions by the \nend of 2022.7\nUnderpinning these commitments is \nour determination to expand our ESG \ncapabilities. COP26, held in Glasgow \nduring October and November last year, \nheightened the world\u2019s focus on these \nfactors, along with the challenges and \nopportunities they present for the \nfuture. \nI am proud of the progress we \nhave made in our commitments to \nresponsible investing. Over the past \nyear, Aegon AM UK joined the Net-Zero \nAsset Managers Initiative; the Aegon \nGlobal Sustainable Equity product8 \nwon a prestigious award in the United \nNations Conference of Trade and \nDevelopment (UNCTAD) Sustainable \nGlobal Fund Award category; and we \nhave launched various sustainable \nproducts, including Global Sustainable \nSovereign.9 All of these achievements \nshowcase our commitment and the \nways in which we are constantly striving \nto improve.\nResponsible investing is embedded \nin our rich heritage at Aegon AM, and \nwe believe it has a bright future. We \naspire to drive the industry forward \nby promoting best practices for the \nbenefit of our clients, the industry and \nsociety at large.Covid-19's disruption \nto the world's \npredictable cycles \ncaused a collective \nreassessment of \nthe normalcy and \nroutine of our daily \nlives with priorities \nshifting.
