A study was \nconducted several years ago to measure the \nchange in our carbon footprint as it related to \nchanges we made in our logistics network. It \nwas found that as we optimized our network to \ncut transportation cost there was a correlation \nto improving our carbon footprint.Scope 2: 671,922 MTCO2\nScope 3: N/A\n305-4 GHG emissions intensity Wafer fab GHG emissions (electricity, fuel, PFCs) \nnormalization = 44.362 grams carbon equivalent \nper unitIntensity ratio calculated separately for wafer \nfabs and for assembly and test operations. \nWafer fab normalization unit based on photo \nmove volume.
