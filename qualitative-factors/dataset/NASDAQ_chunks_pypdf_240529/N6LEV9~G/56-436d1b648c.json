Some \nof these projects led to a reduction in chemical consumption or increase in recycling waste. \nFor example, our sites have implemented projects that expand the lifetime of cleaning baths, \nmodified processes to reduce the volume of chemicals per wafer, or installed mini pumps for optimal application of chemicals. \nIn 2019, the total amount of hazardous and non-hazardous waste that we recycled from our manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites \nglobally was 14,958,208 kilograms, while waste directed to landfill was 5,875,919 kilograms. Our total hazardous waste transported was \n6,474,809 kilograms; this includes both solid and liquid waste, but does not include gaseous emissions, wastewater discharge or any waste \nassociated with on-site wastewater treatment.\nCurrent Practice\nAt our Bucheon, Korea manufacturing site, the equipment engineering team is utilizing \nan additional 20% of LC-3200 bottles, saving 230 liters per year, approximately 68 \nbottles. This is an example of a project focused on material optimization and chemical \nwaste reduction.\nProcess Chemicals Usage at  \nWafer Fab Operations  \n[kg/Unit] \u2013 Normalized ValuesProcess Chemicals Usage at  \nAssembly and Test Operations  \n[kg/Unit] \u2013 Normalized Values\n0.00390.00400.00410.00420.00430.00440.00450.0046\n0.00060.00070.00080.00090.00100.00110.00120.00130.0014\n0.00120.0013\n0.00110.00120.0013\nBaseline\n20152016 2017 2018 2019\n2020 Target0.00440.0045\n0.0043\n0.0042\n0.0041\nBaseline\n20152016 2017 2018 2019\n2020 Target", "metadata": {"source": "N6LEV9~G.pdf", "page": 56, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
