{"page_content": "Page 54\nCorporate Social Responsibility ReportEnergy Efficient SemiconductorsScope 1 and 2 Emissions\n[GRI: 305-5]  \nWe are dedicated to reducing our energy consumption and overall carbon footprint by 5% from 2016 to 2020. We \nhave reduced emissions by 9,341 metric tons of CO 2 equivalent through 35 projects in four countries in 2019. We \nsaw a rise in Scope 1 and 2 emissions normalized units (photo-moves for wafer fab operations, kWbonds for assembly \nand test operations) in 2019 due to a decrease in these volumes, which negatively affected our performance. \nOur company also encourages employees to \nconsider the impact of everyday activities on the \nenvironment. We recognize that commuting can \nbe costly, and therefore try to reward employees \nwho take advantage of various commuting \noptions such as vanpooling, carpooling, bus or \nrail travel and bicycle use. Many of our global sites \noffer various employee trip reduction plans and \nmonthly subsidies depending on location and local \nregulatory trip reduction requirements. In 2019, \nour employees in Phoenix, Arizona prevented \neight tons of pollution by using alternate modes \nof transportation. We also offer electric vehicle \ncharging stations for those who have electric \nvehicles.\n05101520253035404550\n220230240250260270280\n38.72 38.27 35.33 35.5844.39\nBaseline\n20152016 2017 2018 2019\n2020 Target276.53\n261.69\n240.05 239.59255.80\nBaseline\n20152016 2017 2018 2019\n2020 TargetScope 1 & 2 Emissions at  \nWafer Fab Operations  \n[g CE/Unit] \u2013 Normalized ValuesScope 1 & 2 Emissions at  \nAssembly and Test Operations  \n[g CE/Unit] \u2013 Normalized Values\nScope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) by Source\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8Million Metric Tonnes Carbon Equivalent\ng CE per Production Normalization Unit\n2015\nScope 1 + 2 Assembly Test Emissions Normalized (g CE/Unit, baseline year 2015)\nScope 1 + 2 Wafer Fabe Emissions Normalized (g CE/Unit, baseline year 2015)0.014277\n38.70.336\n0.180\n20160.013262\n38.30.353\n0.178\n20170.012240\n35.30.387\n0.180\n20180.013240\n35.60.388\n0.184\n20190.014\n277\n38.70.549\n0.183\n050100150200250300\nCombustion Fuel [Scope 1 MMTCE] PFCs [Scope 1 MMTCE] Electricity [Scope 2 MMTCE]", "metadata": {"source": "N6LEV9~G.pdf", "page": 53, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
