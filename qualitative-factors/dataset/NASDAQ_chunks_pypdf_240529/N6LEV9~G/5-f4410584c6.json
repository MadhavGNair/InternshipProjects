Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is \ndeeply rooted in our core values of respect, integrity and initiative. We provide \nour customers around the globe with a broad portfolio of innovative, energy \nefficient and environmentally friendly semiconductor solutions addressing \nvirtually all market segments. Our CSR efforts focus on continually improving \nhow we operate, whether it be related to our business, our governance and \nethics, our people, our environment and/or our communities. \nAs a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and signatory \nof the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, we adhere to an industry code \nof conduct ( RBA Code of Conduct ) and international principles, which \npromote environmentally responsible and ethical conduct. These principles \nare specifically focused around labor, health and safety, the environment, ethics and management systems standards. Our global Human \nRights Policy  reflects our commitment to preserving and protecting the rights of others as enshrined under the ten principles of the UN \nGlobal Compact as well as other international conventions and frameworks. Per our commitment as an RBA full member, each of our \nmanufacturing sites must complete an RBA self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) annually, and undergo either an internal RBA audit or an \nexternal RBA validated assessment program (VAP) audit on alternating years. The target score for each of our facilities is 85% or greater, \nindicating no-to-low risk in the focus areas previously mentioned. In 2019, 100% of our facilities met this target.
