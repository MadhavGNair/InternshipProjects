Providing Environmentally Sustainable Insurance Solutions\nEnabling the Transition to a Lower \nCarbon Economy \nWe play a critical role \nin helping insureds \ntransition toward a \nlow-carbon economy. In \nNovember 2021, our U.K. \nInsurance operations \njoined \u201cClimate Transition Pathways,\u201d an initiative currently \nincubated by Willis Towers Watson which helps high \ncarbon industries find insurance capacity when their \ntransition plans are aligned with the Paris Agreement1 and \nare accredited by an external third party. This partnership \nprovides these industries access to insurance while they \ntake steps to transition. We are proud to support this \ninnovative solution.Solar Surety Bonds to Accelerate \nthe Climate Transition\nWe leverage our surety bond practice to accelerate \nthe climate transition. The demand for renewable \nenergy, including solar energy, drives an increase in \nsolar development projects. In early 2021, our surety \nteam formally created \u201cProject Flywheel,\u201d a dedicated \nteam of surety underwriters targeting and specializing \nin the renewable energy industry. The team focuses on \nsolar, wind, battery/energy storage, biomass and hydro \nopportunities for financial assurance requirements. These \nrequirements include surety bonds that guarantee EPC \ncontracts, power purchase agreements, interconnection \nagreements with utilities, decommissioning agreements \nof installed solar and wind assets and procurement \ncontracts. We are positioned to be a leading market \nprovider of surety credit in the renewable space for our \ntargeted agents and brokers. We\u2019ve seen meaningful \ngrowth in renewable energy projects over the last 18 \nmonths. \n2021 SUBMISSIONS\nSince implementation of our Thermal \nCoal Policy, and even earlier in some \ncases, we have decreased our thermal \ncoal accounts for various reasons \nincluding:\n \u0084Submission had no climate-\nrelated transition plan.\n \u0084Insured was benefiting from \ndeforestation.\n2021 TOTAL ESCALATIONS\nThese escalations represent our 2021 \nworldwide coal escalations, excluding \nthe U.S. Our U.S. underwriting groups \nphased out of the majority of coal \naccounts by the end of 2021.30%  Acknowledge \nset risk \nthreshold.\nScreen and \nassess all coal \ntransactions \nagainst the \nset risk \nthreshold.\nEscalate \nflagged \ntransactions \n\u2013 Refer to the \nappropriate \nescalation \ncommittee. \nEnvironmental \nRisk Oversight \nCommittee \n(EROC) further \nassesses \ntransaction.\nEROC reports \noutcomes to ESG \ngroup quarterly.Early \n2021\nThermal Coal Policy \nin global insurance \nunderwriting \nimplemented.or more of an account\u2019s revenues \nderived from coal power production.\nOur Approach to \nUnderwriting Coal\nTotal Proceed/Bound: 56Total Abstain/Non-renewed: 42\nView our Thermal Coal Policy > >1 Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, Dec 12, 2015, T.I.A.S.
