By organizing our strategy around these pillars, we seek to encompass Arch\u2019s collaborative ESG successes and sustainability progress across our operations.\nStriving to make a \ndifference by investing \nin our communities \nis one of Arch\u2019s core \nvalues, woven into the \nfabric of our culture.We are committed to \ninvesting in the success \nof our employees \nas individuals and \nprofessionals to create \nlong-term sustainable \ngrowth as an \norganization.We believe incorporating \nmaterial, nonfinancial \nESG factors into \ninvestment selection \nand risk management \nhas the potential to \nenhance long-term \ninvestment returns.By actively managing \nESG risks and \nembedding compliance, \ntransparency, data \nprotection and resiliency \nacross all areas of \nour operations, we \nprotect our people and \ncustomers who entrust \nus with their personal \ninformation and \nbusiness. As a global (re)insurer, \nwe provide services and \ninsurance coverages \nthat allow our clients \nto rebuild after major \nlosses and improve their \nresilience; we integrate \nESG considerations \ninto our underwriting \nto reduce risk and \ntake advantage of \nopportunities for \nthe benefit of our \nstakeholders.By focusing our 2021 ESG story on our work to integrate \nsustainability-driven thinking and decision-making \ninto these core areas of our Company, we seek to \nencompass Arch\u2019s collaborative ESG successes and \nsustainability progress across our worldwide operations, \nunderwriting segments and investments. To better \naccount for current and emerging ESG trends, in 2021, \nwe undertook a high-level review of our sustainability \npriorities. While reaffirming the importance of the \npriority topics outlined in our first Sustainability Report \nin 2019, the exercise also led us to implement changes to \nsimplify and reprioritize key ESG topics as illustrated in \nthis new ESG priorities matrix.\nThe conclusions from this assessment highlight how \nour corporate values are central to everything we do, \nreinforce the importance of stakeholder feedback, \nand help prioritize our ESG strategy and disclosures \ngoing forward. We value ongoing feedback from our \nstakeholders and will review our ESG priorities annually.ESG Priorities Matrix Our ESG Reporting  \nWe believe in the value of transparency around our sustainability initiatives, and we are excited to share our 2021 progress in the following annual reports: \nE S G\nSocial Capital Human Capital\nCarbon \nEmissions \n(Operations)Access to \nFinance & \nSocial Product \nDevelopmentEmployee \nHealth & \nSafetyBusiness \nEthics & \nStandards\nClimate Risk \n& Climate \nChange \nManagementCommunity \nRelations/ \nEngagementDiversity & \nInclusionCorporate \nGovernance\nFinancing \nEnvironmental \nImpactPrivacy & Data \nSecuritySystemic Risk \nManagement\nResponsible \nInvestment\nSupply \nChain Labor \nStandards\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACGL_2021.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
