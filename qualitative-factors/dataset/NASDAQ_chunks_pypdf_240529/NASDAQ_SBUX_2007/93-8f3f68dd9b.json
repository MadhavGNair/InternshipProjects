Currently there are no statutory requirements or generally \naccepted verification standards in the United States of America \nthat relate to the preparation, presentation, and verification of CSR \nreports. There are international standards for the CSR reports that \nwere approved by the International Auditing and Assurances Standards \nBoard (IAASB) in January 2005. Using the IAASB approved standards \nas a guideline, we planned and performed evidence-gathering \nprocedures to provide a basis for our conclusion.

Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\nOur evidence-gathering procedures included, among other activities, \nthe following:\nTesting the effectiveness of the internal reporting system used to \ncollect and compile information on each area of focus in the Report;\nPerforming specific procedures, on a sample basis, to validate \nthe CSR data on site at Starbucks coffee buying operations in \nSwitzerland; C.A.F.E. Practices operations in Costa Rica; and \nCorporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington;\nInterviewing partners responsible for data collection and reporting;\nInterviewing partners at retail locations;\nAssessing the information gathering and compiling process of \neach area of focus in the Report;\nReviewing relevant documentation, including corporate policies, \nmanagement and reporting structures; and\nPerforming tests, on a sample basis, of documentation and \nsystems used to collect, analyze and compile reported CSR \ninformation and data.  \nIn our opinion, based on our work described in this report, the CSR \ninformation contained in the Report gives a fair representation of \nCSR performance and activities of Starbucks Coffee Company for \nthe fiscal year ended September 30, 2007.
