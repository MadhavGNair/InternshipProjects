Cradle-to-grave efforts like \nrecycling are just as important. \nMoreover, the 3D printing digital design process often \nmakes unnecessary physical products and part \niterations obsolete, thereby significantly reducing \nwaste, materials, and non-renewable energy. \nWe don\u2019t have all the solutions, but together with our \ncustomers and partners we aim to improve the life \ncycle of our products and parts.9.1 Addressing the R\u2019s at Stratasys\nWe aim to support your businesses net zero goals and \ncarbon footprint reduction.
