We continue to analyze data from waste audits conducted at our largest sites to shape initiatives for recycling and waste reduction. These initiatives have helped us to increase our rate of recycling from 35 percent to 50 percent from 2007 through 2014.\nWe use data from water maps developed for each of our sites \nto understand our most significant water users and identify new opportunities for conservation. A key component of Amgen\u2019s water conservation program is a wastewater treatment plant at our manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico that has enabled an average of 74 percent of the treated wastewater to be recycled on-site each year. We also integrate low-water landscaping and smart-irrigation controls at a variety of facilities. Energy conservation projects lead to water conservation benefits.\nWater Intake Water Intake Avoided \nFrom 2007 Through 2012*Water Intake Avoided* 2013 +3,000\n1,000\n5002,000\n1,5002,5003,500\n*Value represents year-over-year, cumulative and continuing avoidance.2007\u20132014 Water Intake and Intake Avoided* \nThrough Conservation Efforts (1,000 m3)Water\n0Reduction\nRecycling, Composting, Reuse\nDisposal3,542\n6,604\n20074,037249\n4,798\n20084,757442\n4,370\n20105,197875\n4,449\n20114,532358\n4,177\n20094,7621,094\n4,256\n20124,5201,094320\n4,260\n20134,5011,094459\n4,429\n2014\n20073,286\n20082,738550\n20092,537601\n20102,574663\n20112,577673\n20132,72568619\n20142,48768636\n20122,720686\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2014.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
