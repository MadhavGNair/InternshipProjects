Our strategy has been to complete utilities projects that provide substantial returns for both energy savings and carbon reduction across our network of facilities around the world. We also mitigate environmental impacts using sustainable practices and technology in the design and construction of manufacturing and office facilities. We have realized more than $21 million in cost savings and reduced carbon emissions by 94,000 metric tons from 2008 through 2014 by implementing specific energy conservation and carbon reduction projects.\nWe are making progress towards our sales fleet carbon-reduction \ntarget, raising the minimum fuel efficiency standard for vehicles year by year. We continue to expand the range of fuel-efficient vehicle choices available for mobile staff\u2014and to rotate out less fuel-efficient vehicles. \n2007\u2013201 4 US Fleet Fuel Use a nd Fuel Use Avoided Through \nConservation  (per 1,000 Gal)*\n2,000\n1,000\n500\n01,5002,500\nUS Fleet Fuel Use US Fuel Use Avoided \n2007 Through 2012US Fuel Use Avoided 2013 +Fuel Efficiency\n412\n200936\n 84\n385\n201284 848 10\n363 354\n2013 20144,341\n20074,019245\n2008542\n3,916\n2010718\n3,903\n2011407\n4,006\n2009919\n3,849\n2012919106\n3,817\n2013919131\n3,706\n2014\n1,498\n20071,44314\n20081,849345\n20101,784363\n20111,297169\n20091,739427\n20121,738427104\n20131,381427\n2014185Performance", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2014.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
