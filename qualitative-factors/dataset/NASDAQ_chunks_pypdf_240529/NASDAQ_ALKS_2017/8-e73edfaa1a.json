Examples include:\n\u2022  Integrating environmental\nconsiderations into our site \nselections, designs and builds\n\u2022  Using building monitoring\nsystems to collect data and  \nmake real-time adjustments\n\u2022  Conducting systematic reviews\nof building operations and utilities to ensure systems and facilities are operating correctly \nand efficiently.We also deploy operational \nexcellence teams to identify \npotential improvements in critical \nareas, such as energy demand  \nand waste stream management.  \nIn 2017, as a result of an operational excellence team review, a site replaced its existing \nlighting with high efficiency LED \nlighting. This change is expected  \nto result in an annual savings of  \n107 megawatt hours \u2014 the  \ncarbon-sequestered equivalent  \nof 1,500 trees.  \n As a result of these and other efforts, we have made significant \nstrides, including attaining an \nenergy use intensity below the average pharmaceutical facility (1.26 megawatt hour / square meters in 2017 compared to \nindustry average of 3.81) and \nachieving LEED and ISO14001 certification of select facilities.\nEnergy Usage Greenhouse Gas Emissions Water Usage\nEnergy Use  \n(megawatt hours)Scope 1&2 Emissions\nEnergy Use per Revenue\n(megawatt hours / million $ revenue)Scope 1&2 Emissions per Revenue\n(CO2e / million $ revenue)Water Use per Revenue\n(cubic meters / million $ revenue)Water Use\n(cubic meters)\nScope 1 (metric tonnes)\nScope 2 (metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents)\nEnergy Use per Employee\n(megawatt hours / employee)Scope 1&2 Emissions per Employee \n(metric tons of CO2e / employee)Water Use per Employee  \n(cubic meters / employee)2015 2015 2015\n2015 2015 2015\n2015 2015 20152016 2016 2016\n2016 2016 2016\n2016 2016 20162017 2017 2017\n2017 2017 2017\n2017 2017 2017\n80\n179\n7565633 293412,205 112,19828,205\n18,917\n65\n140\n60463 122\n52 37428 214345,064 104,21027,172\n17,893\n58 25 177337,524 110,52528,251\n18,815\n125,000  \n100,000\n75,000\n50,000\n25,000\n0\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n300\n225\n150\n75\n0\n700\n525\n350\n175\n0\n90\n60\n30\n0\n180\n120\n60\n0\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n0\n500,000\n400,000\n300,000\n200,000\n100,000\n0\n9", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALKS_2017.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
