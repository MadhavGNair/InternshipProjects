We also have an early stage candidate for the treatment of cancer.PRECLINICAL\nARIPIPRAZOLE LAUROXIL NANOCRYSTAL\u00ae DISPERSION\nSchizophrenia\nALKS 5461\nMajor Depressive Disorder\nALKS 3831\nSchizophrenia\nBIIB098 (FORMERLY ALKS 8700)\nMultiple Sclerosis\nALKS 4230\nCancer ImmunotherapyPHASE 1 PHASE 2 PHASE 3NEW DRUG \nAPPLICATION \nREVIEWPatient-Inspired Solutions\nEvery day, people around the world live with \nthe challenges of central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as schizophrenia, depression, addiction and multiple sclerosis (MS). With these people and their loved ones in mind, we work daily to develop medicines to meaningfully improve the lives of those affected by these diseases.\nMedicines\nWe developed and commercialize \nARISTADA\u00ae (aripiprazole lauroxil) \nfor the treatment of schizophrenia and VIVITROL\u00ae (naltrexone \nfor extended-release injectable \nsuspension) for the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence  \nin the United States. In addition,  \nwe developed proprietary drug delivery technology, \nwhich is incorporated into \nnumerous medicines owned and commercialized by third parties, \nsuch as Johnson & Johnson, Acorda \nand AstraZeneca, for patients with mental illness, MS and diabetes.\nProduct Quality & Safety\nWe adhere to all applicable  \nquality and safety regulations for  \nour medicines, including Good Clinical Practice regulations,  \nGood Manufacturing Practice  \nregulations, Good Laboratory Practice regulations and the U.S. \nControlled Substances Act.  \nAlong with our manufacturing \npartners, we implement rigorous \nprocesses to ensure the quality and \nsafety of our medicines across their lifecycle \u2014 from pre-clinical studies \nto commercial use. As part of these \nprocesses, Alkermes employees receive comprehensive safety and \nquality training.  \nThe U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA), the  \nEuropean Medicines Authority (EMA) and other global regulatory \nagencies routinely inspect our \nfacilities in Athlone, Ireland; Waltham, Massachusetts and \nWilmington, Ohio. No significant \nadverse regulatory findings have been identified.\n Research & Development\nOur research and development \n(R&D) builds on our deep expertise \nin the intricacies of the CNS and the opioid receptor pathway. \nOur experience in formulation \nand our proprietary development platforms also allow us to develop \nnew medicines to address unmet \nneeds for people with CNS diseases. Dedication to focused \nand pioneering R&D is core to our \nidentity, our commitment to great science and the sustainability of \nour business. In 2017, we invested \n$412.9 million in R&D, from  \npre-clinical work to clinical studies, \nto advance the development of \nnew medicines. \n3", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALKS_2017.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
