{"page_content": "Our responsible  \ninvestment principles\nResponsible investing is a key element \nof our investment philosophy and \nprocess. Our responsible investment \nprinciples define and guide our \napproach across asset classes and \nregions while allowing us to help \nour clients navigate the responsible \ninvestment landscape. \nResponsible investing aligns \nwith clients\u2019 interests  \nAs stewards of our clients' capital, \nwe think it's prudent to consider \nall relevant and material risks and \nopportunities, including ESG factors, \nas part of our comprehensive issuer \nresearch. With a focus on long-term \nresults, we use responsible investing \npractices such as ESG integration and \nactive ownership to support a holistic \nunderstanding of the investments we \nmake on behalf of our clients.\nResponsible investing can \ncontribute to long-term value  \nA growing body of academic research \ndemonstrates that sound ESG practices \ncan enhance corporate financial \nperformance in the long term. This \nvalue can manifest itself in the form \nof lower cost of and access to capital, \nbetter operational performance, \nreduced reputational risks and, in turn, \npotentially superior long-term returns. \nEnvironmental and social risks \nare investment risks  \nExogenous risks such as natural \ndisasters and pandemics can disrupt \nindustries and threaten business \nmodels. Failure to effectively manage \nsuch risks can lead to a range of \nfinancial, legal and reputational \nconsequences. A company's ability to \nmitigate such risks can have a profound \neffect on their ability to create and \nsustain long-term value. Integrating ESG factors can help \nuncover opportunities  \nWe believe that focusing solely \non financial metrics may lead to \noverlooking opportunities. We find \nthat it is quite challenging to analyze \nfuture profitability and creditworthiness \nwithout considering ESG factors. \nBy considering these factors in our \nresearch process, we strive to deliver \nbetter investment outcomes and long-\nterm performance. \nActive ownership is active \nmanagement  \nOur stewardship ambitions extend \nbeyond today's investment opportunity. \nBy leading engagement efforts and \nexercising shareholder voting rights, \nwe use our voice to help effect positive \nchange. We collaborate with other \ninvestors and stakeholders to engage \nwhere possible to maximize our voice. \nResponsible investment \ndefined\nResponsible investment (RI) is \nan umbrella term that covers \nvarious tools and approaches \nto incorporating Environmental, \nSocial and Governance (ESG) \nconsiderations into investment \ndecision-making processes. It \nmay include ESG integration \nand active ownership as well \nas dedicated, RI-focused \ncapabilities. Related terms \nmay include sustainable or ESG \ninvesting. \n5Our responsible investment principles", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2020.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
