{"page_content": "Engagement Case Studies \nClimate change\nA major energy company with \nadditional operations in energy \nservices and coal mining is a \nsystematically important greenhouse \ngas emitter involved in all stages of \nthe thermal coal value chain. \nEngagement  \nOur engagement called on the \nenergy company to minimize their \ndependence on thermal coal while \nsimultaneously improving their \ndisclosure related to their thermal \ncoal mining operations as part of their \n2050 climate neutral commitment. \nInitial contact was made in 2019 as \npart of a collaborative effort with \nother Climate Action 100+ signatories \nregarding their long-term net-zero \nambitions. When it became clear that \nit would end up in violation of the thermal coal exclusionary criteria, \nwe continued to engage bilaterally in \norder to push for greater disclosure \nand clarity regarding their thermal \ncoal mining business. For a time, it \nwas excluded from our investment \nuniverse due to the scale of their coal \nmining business exceeding our policy \nthreshold. \nOutcome  \nAs a result of our engagement \nefforts, the energy company \nincreased the level of detail, \ntransparency and disclosure related \nto their coal mining operations as \npart of their climate strategy. Investor \npressure, coupled with an overall \ncontraction of economic activity in \nEurope throughout 2020, continues \nto pressure the company to eliminate \ntheir dependency on thermal coal.\n20EngagementDefending creditor rights \nA pandemic-induced liquidity event \ncaused a large automotive company \nto plan to move assets out of the \nrestricted group and therefore remove \nthat credit support for the existing \nbonds. The company subsequently \nplanned to raise debt against those \nassets to improve its liquidity, which \nwould effectively subordinate \nbondholders to the new debt.\nEngagement  \nAs these assets were also substantially \nall the firm's tangible assets, Aegon \nAM worked with existing bondholders \nto oppose this transaction. Scale in \nbondholder groups is key to have \ncredibility, as well as to ensure voting \nand blocking power. Aegon AM's \nposition was important to achieve \nthe thresholds required to block this \ntransaction. We joined with a group of \nlike-minded bondholders to discuss this \nwith the company. \nOutcome  \nDespite attempts to engage with \nthe company as a bondholder group, \nthe business was initially reluctant \nto engage. This required immediate \nescalation to protect investors. The company attempted to circumvent its \nexisting bondholders by applying to the \ncourt to instruct it to release security \npledged to the bondholders. After our \nlegal representation was able to delay \nthe firm's ability to push through the \ntransaction, we were able to negotiate \nand confirm several key investor \noutcomes: \n\u2022 The collateral stripping transaction \nwas blocked.\n\u2022 The legal documentation governing \nthe bonds was materially improved, \nrestricting the business from taking \ncertain actions without bondholder \nconsent or requiring them to pay \ndown debt. Importantly, the most \nvaluable assets underpinning credit \nsupport were explicitly protected \nfrom being transferred out of the \nbondholder's control. \n\u2022 Shareholders invested new capital \ninto the business and no new debt \nwas required.\nUltimately, as part of this bondholder \ngroup, Aegon AM was able to \nproactively work to defend creditor \nrights.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2020.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
