{"page_content": "As active equity investors we believe \nintegrating ESG into our investment \ndecision-making strengthens our \ninvestment conviction, supports the \nmanagement of concentrated portfolios \nand promotes a long-term focus\u2014an \nimportant consideration when the \ngeneral trend in many markets is more \nshort term.\nESG considerations are part of \nour fundamental equity research\nRather than taking a broad approach, \nenvironmental, social and governance \nissues are explicitly considered in our \nfundamental research. We know ESG \nissues have the potential to materially \nimpact both the financial performance \nand the valuation of our investee \ncompanies. This has always been integral \nto our investment approach. \nThe heart of our process lies within \nthe teamwork between our fund \nmanagers and our independent \nresponsible investment team. In our \ntraditional equity strategies, i.e., those \nnot classified as responsible investment \nsolutions, it is the responsibility of our \nfund managers to form a judgment on \nESG issues, ensuring that ESG analysis \nis comprehensive and robust, and to \nleverage the responsible investment \nteam for their expertise. Examples of \nareas we assess include: a company's \nrange of products and their implications \nfor ESG outcomes; climate change \npolicies and impact; carbon emissions; \ngovernance structure; management \nboard structure and compensation; social \npolicies; how a company is positioned for \nthe transition to a greener economy; and \nits resource efficiency. \nThree-stage ESG assessment \nprocess \nTo bring this together, our equity team \nuses a three-stage ESG assessment \nprocess to determine the materiality of \nthe identified ESG factors from a risk and \nreturn perspective. Stage 1: Identifying the most important \nESG factor impacts for a given company. \nStage 2: Determine an ESG factor's \nlevel of significance relative to other \nconsiderations. What is the overall \nimpact upon the investment proposition? \nIs it a headwind or a tailwind to business \nperformance or valuation? \nStage 3: Finally, we look at the \ndirection of travel for a given ESG \nfactor and a company's overall ESG \nprofile. Is exposure to these ESG risks \nor opportunities improving or not? We \nbelieve this consideration is critical \nas ESG (similar to other investment \nconsiderations) cannot be viewed in a \nstatic manner and as a firm we value and \nsupport ESG improvement over time.\nOur one-team approach \nImportantly, all information related \nto research, company meetings notes \nand responsible investment team \nengagement activity is centrally stored \nto provide easy access to all team \nmembers, reflecting our one-team \nculture. We have a number of examples \nwhere the investment team has \nconcluded that ESG considerations were \nthe primary driver behind whether to \ninvest in a stock or not. \nThe responsible investment team's \nengagement is well-suited to advancing \nbroad themes such as diversity and \ninclusion which, in aggregate, are key to \nthe functioning of the financial system. \nEngaging with companies on climate \nchange risk is another example of the \nteam's activity. On the other hand, the \nfundamental equity analysts' focus is \nmore specifically upon the strategy \nof the company to deliver sustainable \nlong-term returns to shareholders. \nOur analysts directly engage with \nmanagement to better understand the \nrisks, opportunities and materiality of \nESG factors, and how companies are \nadapting their strategies to manage \nthose issues.ESG integration:  \nEquities\nESG integration: Equities11", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2020.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
