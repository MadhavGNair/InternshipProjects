{"page_content": "Sustainability is quickly becoming a \nsignificant focus of investors across the \nmarketplace. Our Global Sustainable \nSovereign strategy provides one option \nto help meet this growing demand. \nIncorporating sustainability alignment \ninto sovereign portfolio construction can \nhelp investors to mitigate risk, contribute \nto sustainable growth and pursue \ncompetitive long-term performance. \nHowever, sustainable investing in \nsovereign debt requires an additional set \nof tools and expertise beyond traditional \nportfolio management; it requires a \ncomprehensive and tailored process. \nAligned with the UN SDGs, the strategy \ntargets a balance between developed \nmarkets and investment grade emerging \nmarkets. The strategy is supported by \nresearch in sustainable investment in \nfixed income. Focused on sovereign \nbonds with a global sustainable \napproach, we provide comprehensive \nreasoning on investments.\nThe objective of the strategy is to invest \nin financially strong countries making \ncontributions towards the targets \ndefined by the UN SDGs. The main \ndrivers of return for the strategy consist \nof the spread of non-core assets, i.e., \nassets below the average credit rating \nof the portfolio, along with core assets \nwhich are intended to provide resiliency \nunder adverse scenarios, like those \npresented by the physical risks of climate \nchange. \nSovereign sustainable \nassessment in practice\nEvaluating the sustainability of sovereign \nissuers requires a tailored approach. \nFrom quantitative inputs such as SDG \nscores to qualitative assessments of \nsustainability risk, a comprehensive \nsustainability research framework \ncombines various inputs to form a \nholistic view of an issuer\u2019s sustainability \nprofile. The assessment methodology \nshould be flexible and granular enough \nto account for differences between \ncountries. Our process for identifying \nqualified issuers for the strategy \nis twofold: it is a combination of \nsustainability and fundamental analysis \nsupported by proprietary research. Using our proprietary methodology to \nclassify each country into one of five \ncategories reflecting their sustainability \nprofile, countries are identified as \nleaders, influencers, improvers, neutral or \ndetrimental. \nBy conducting a thorough sustainability \nassessment, we look beyond the high-\nlevel SDG scores to identify gaps in the \ncountry\u2019s sustainability profile. Challenge \ngaps\u2014SDGs in which countries show \na significant lag against the general \naverage\u2014are dependent on the initial \ncircumstances of each country, in terms \nof development, income and region. For \nexample, by splitting all countries into \ndifferent income groups, we can identify \nwhich SDGs are the most challenging per \nspecific group, or what we denominate \n\u201csalient SDGs\u201d, and assess whether a \ncountry is leading or lagging within its \nreference group.\nBesides income group, geographical \nlocation or Organization for Economic \nCo-operation and Development (OECD) \nmembership can also help to identify \na relevant peer group and SDGs where \nthe largest challenge gaps exist, and \nthus, where the most effort is needed. \nFor example, Inequality (SDG 10) and \nInfrastructure (SDG 9) stand out as \nparticularly challenging for non-OECD \ncountries. Given differences that exist \nacross countries, we believe geographic \ndiversification within a sustainability-\nthemed portfolio promotes consistent \nconsideration of all relevant SDGs.\nFinally, as active owners of sovereign \ndebt, we seek adequate disclosure \nand transparency on ESG factors and \nprogress on SDGs. Given the long-term \ninvestment horizon of a sustainability-\nthemed sovereign portfolio, we believe \nit is paramount that we analyze ESG \nrisks upfront and engage with issuers \nto understand the creditworthiness \nand determinants of sovereign bond \nperformance. Active engagement can \nhelp us to assess the sustainability \nprofile of a developed and emerging \ncountry, and ultimately can help inform \nportfolio construction and alter portfolio \ncomposition.Sovereign Sustainability\nCategoriesResponsible investment capabilities:  \nGlobal Sustainable Sovereign Strategy1\nResponsible investment capabiliites: Global Sustainable Sovereign Strategy17LeaderAchieved critical SDGs and \noutstanding commitment to \nsustainabilityInfluencerOn track to achieve some \nSDGs, clear commitment to \nsustainability and limited \nsustainability riskImproverAbove average sustainability \nprofile with low risk and promise \nto tackle controversies, but faces \nSDG achievement challengesNeutralNot on track to achieve most \nSDGs, no clear ambition and \naverage sustainability riskDetrimentalNot on track to achieve the SDGs, \nhigher sustainability risk and \npossible major controversies\n1This strategy is advised or sub-advised by Aegon AM \nNL and may not be available to all investors or in all \njurisdictions.
