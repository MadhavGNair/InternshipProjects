{"page_content": "Responsible investing: a tenet \nof our heritage and our future\nThis last year has demanded much \nof our world. Amid the uncertainty \nat the onset of the pandemic, it was \napparent that a greater movement \nwas taking place\u2014bringing a glimmer \nof hope during an exceptionally \nchallenging time. As Covid-19 coursed \nacross borders, the world adapted \nand humanity pulled together for the \ngreater good. This was visible in the \nmedical professionals and essential \ncare workers selflessly putting their \nown health and lives at risk; and it was \nevident with the quick course of action \ntaken by central banks across the globe \nto dampen the monetary repercussions \nof a global pandemic that caused \nsupply chains to come to a stilted and \nunexpected halt. \nThe pandemic's disruption to the \nworld's predictable cycles caused \na collective reassessment in the \nmonotony and normalcy of our daily \nlife prior to the outbreak. Priorities \nshifted and more emphasis has \nbeen placed on the importance of \nenvironmental, social and corporate \ngovernance issues on society at large. \nOne good thing to come from Covid-19 \nis to see responsible investing efforts \naccelerated during the pandemic. As we \nenter a post-pandemic world, we are \nalready seeing investors place greater \nimportance upon it with a stronger \nfocus on environmental and social \nimpact. While our daily life may look a little \ndifferent, our commitments remain \nthe same: to deliver the highest-\nquality investment solutions to our \nclients; pursue competitive long-term \nresults through active investment \nmanagement; and provide our \nemployees fulfilling careers, financial \nstability and a safe, inclusive and \ndiverse workplace. Underpinning our \nambitions is a strong commitment to \nexpanding our ESG capabilities. \nResponsible investing is embedded \nin our rich heritage at Aegon Asset \nManagement. While others may claim \nto be pioneers, we actually were with \nour heritage dating back to the 1980s. \nBut we're not focused on who did what \nfirst; to us, one of the most important \nmandates is held in the future and \nwhat's at stake. We believe the way \nforward with responsible investing is \nbrighter. We are proud of our history, \nbut we know the world does not \nstand still. To that effect, I can assure \nyou neither will Aegon AM. We are \ncommitted to responsible investing \nand aspire to drive the industry forward \nby promoting best practices for the \nbenefit of our clients, the industry and \nsociety at large. We believe the \nway forward with \nresponsible investing \nis brighter. We are \nproud of our history, \nbut we know the \nworld does not stand \nstill. To that effect, I \ncan assure you neither \nwill Aegon AM. \n3Bas NieuweWeme, CEO\nResponsible investing: a tenet of our heritage and our future", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2020.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
