{"page_content": " \nESG Integration\nOur research framework  \nESG factors are systematically \nintegrated into our bottom-up \nresearch process for fixed income and \nequity issuers. We aim to develop our \nown holistic house view of issuers' \nESG profiles. By integrating ESG \nconsiderations with economic factors, \nand drawing from specialized ESG \nresearch sources, the research teams \nseek to identify financially material ESG \nfactors and arrive at an independent, \ncomprehensive view of the investment. \nWe seek to answer three key \nquestions:\n\u2022 What is the potential economic \nimpact of the ESG issue and its \nassociated effect on the issuer\u2019s \nlong-term growth potential, \nprofitability or creditworthiness?\n\u2022 Are ESG risks and opportunities \naccurately reflected in valuations?\n\u2022 Is engagement beneficial to generate \nlong- term economic value?Financial materiality is key  \nWe view ESG analysis as a risk \nmanagement tool and a potential \nalpha source. By integrating ESG \nfactors into the traditional financial \nanalysis framework, we aim to identify \nfinancially material factors which \ncould affect the issuer's long-term \ngrowth potential, profitability, or \ncreditworthiness, and to assess if they \nare appropriately priced. \nDebunking common ESG myths  \nOur ESG integration process focuses \non managing financial risks and \nidentifying opportunities by including \nadditional information in investment \nanalysis to help inform our decision \nmaking. ESG integration does not \nseek to make ethical judgements and \nimposes no ESG-related restrictions \non the investment universe. It seeks \nto systematically uncover ESG risks \nand opportunities to ensure they are \nappropriately priced in the investment \nbeing considered.\n9ESG integrationThree key benefits of ESG integration\nDeepens our \nknowledge\nBringing new \naspects to light, \nproviding a more \ncomprehensive view \nof the investmentStrengthens our \nconviction\nAs fundamental, \nresearch-driven \ninvestors, it can make \nus more confident in \nour decisionsPromotes a  \nlong-term focus\nClearing the short-term \nnoise allows us to \nfocus on long-term and \nfundamental trends, \nrisks and opportunities", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2020.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
