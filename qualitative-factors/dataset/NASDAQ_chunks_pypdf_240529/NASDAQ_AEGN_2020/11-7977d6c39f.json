{"page_content": "Integrating ESG factors requires striking \nthe right balance between quantitative \nand qualitative insights. A proprietary \nassessment of environmental, \nsocial and corporate governance \nconsiderations is a vital component \nof our structured credit research \nframework and investment decision-\nmaking process. Unlike equities or \ncorporate bonds, formal ESG integration \nis comparatively nascent within \nstructured credit. There is limited third-\nparty ESG research and few industry \nstandards for private securitized issuers. \nAs a result, assessing ESG factors for \nsecuritized assets requires a more \ncreative approach.  \nMitigate risk and uncover \nopportunities \nTo reflect the specific considerations \nfor structured credit, we built a \nproprietary framework that is rigorous \nand comprehensive, but not overly rigid. \nWe aim to uncover risks and potential \nmitigants that could affect collateral, \nstructure and/or issuer performance. \nESG integration can also uncover \nopportunities. Our process identifies \nfinancially material ESG factors in \ncombination with traditional financial \ncriteria. We look for potential ESG \nconcerns or opportunities around the \nsponsor\u2019s business model that could \nimpact performance. We also assess \nif there are mitigants in place to help \naddress the ESG risks we identify and \nwe explore ways to extract value from \nESG-related opportunities. This process \naims to answer three key questions: \nEnvironmental: Are there specific \nenvironmental and climate change \nconsiderations that should be \ncontemplated? \nSocial: Does the issuer create utility \nand long-term value for customers, \nbondholders and itself? Governance: Is the deal structured to \nprovide an appropriate economic split \nand incentives to transaction parties?\nA holistic and comprehensive \napproach \nAfter determining the potential \nfinancial impact of relevant ESG \nfactors, our research team considers \nvarious outcomes to help understand \nthe potential impact on economics, \ncreditworthiness and valuations. The \nprocess includes quantitative and \nqualitative factors.
