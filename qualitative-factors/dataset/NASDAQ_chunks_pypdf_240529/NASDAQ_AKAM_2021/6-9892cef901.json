And the Akamai Intelligent \nEdge Platform played an enormous role in the internet \necosystem by securing and delivering online \nexperiences for billions of people.\nPowering and protecting life online requires a globally \ndistributed network of servers in thousands of data \ncenters (many as big as football fields). These data \ncenters are estimated to account for approximately \n1% of global electricity demand. Akamai believes it is \ntime for companies in the internet industry (and \nbeyond) to take shared responsibility for climate \nchange and engage in efforts to reduce their \ncollective impact.\nAkamai is committed to reducing our environmental \nimpact. To fulfill that commitment, Akamai announced \nfive goals in 2021 to reduce and mitigate our effects \non the environment by 2030. They are:\n1. 100% renewably sourced energy \n2. A 50% more energy-efficient platform\n3. 100% platform emissions mitigation\n4. Responsible supply chain management \n5.
