{"page_content": "7  Autodesk Sustainability in Action \u2014 Progress Report FY2011Sustainability-Enabling Products \nAutodesk software helps our customers create, visualize,  \nand simulate designs before they are real. With consistent, \ncoordinated information in a digital model, designers and \nengineers can more quickly and accurately conduct analysis  \nand interpret results. This capability leads to better-informed \ndecisions on factors related to environmental performance. \nAutodesk Building Information Modeling (BIM) solutions make \nsustainability more accessible and cost-effective for buildings  \nand infrastructure and help improve how those are planned, \ndesigned, built, and managed. BIM, an intelligent model\u2013based design process, helps our customers integrate design, simulation, \nand visualization into their workflows to gain greater insight on \nhow to more efficiently use energy, water, materials, and land \nthroughout the lifecycle of buildings and infrastructure.\nIn manufacturing, Autodesk Digital Prototyping solutions enable \nour customers to explore the real-world performance of designs, \ndigitally. This helps them create more cost-effective and \nsustainable designs that are optimized for material selection and \nenergy efficiency, and that are easier to manufacture and recycle \nat end-of-life, reducing waste and cost.  \nSeveral Autodesk products enable sustainable design.\n11    Available to Autodesk\u00ae Subscription customers of Autodesk\u00ae Revit\u00ae Architecture and Autodesk\u00ae Revit\u00ae MEP software.\n12 Included with AutoCAD\u00ae Civil 3D\u00ae and AutoCAD\u00ae Map 3D software.\nAutodesk\u00ae Building Design \nSuite Premium  provides tools  \nto help design, analyze, and \nvisualize more innovative and \nenergy-efficient building \ndesigns, including:  \n\u2022\t Autodesk\u00ae Revit\u00ae software \nfor BIM\u2014to more easily \ncreate building models \nusing intelligent objects \nand integrated conceptual \nenergy analysis11 \n\u2022\t Autodesk\u00ae 3ds Max\u00ae \nDesign software\u2014for \nnatural and artificial \ndaylighting simulation and \npowerful visualizations of \ngreen designs\nAutodesk\u00ae Infrastructure \nDesign Suite Premium  \nprovides tools to support \nplanning and design of \nsustainable infrastructure \nprojects, including:\n\u2022\t AutoCAD\u00ae Map 3D \nsoftware\u2014model-based \nGIS software for \ninfrastructure planning \nhelps to better understand \nsite selection options\n\u2022\t AutoCAD\u00ae Civil 3D\u00ae \nsoftware\u2014the BIM \nsolution for civil \nengineering design\n\u2022\t Autodesk\u00ae Storm and \nSanitary Analysis12\u2014\ncomprehensive hydrology \nand hydraulic analysis \napplication\nAutodesk\u00ae Product Design \nSuite  provides designers  \nand engineers a complete set \nof product design and \nvisualization tools for Digital \nPrototyping in a convenient, \ncost-effective package:\n\u2022\t Autodesk\u00ae Inventor\u00ae \nsoftware\u2014design, test, \nand validate products with \nintegrated product \nsimulation tools\n\u2022\t Autodesk\u00ae Vault \nsoftware\u2014create and \nmanage crucial parts lists \nand bills of materials \n(BOMs)\n\u2022\t Autodesk\u00ae 3ds Max\u00ae \nDesign software\u2014easily \ncreate renderings and \nanimations that help convey \nideas to managers, explain \ndesigns to manufacturers, \nand persuade customers\nAutodesk\u00ae Factory Design \nSuite  is a 2D and 3D factory \nlayout and optimization \nsolution that can help users \nmake better layout decisions \nby creating a digital model of \ntheir factory:\n\u2022\t Autodesk\u00ae Inventor\u00ae \nsoftware\u2014create \nintelligent 3D models of \ncustom factory equipment\n\u2022\t Autodesk\u00ae Navisworks\u00ae \nproducts\u2014explore factory \nlayouts with interactive 3D \nvirtual walk-throughs \n\u2022\t AutoCAD\u00ae Architecture \nsoftware\u2014simulate \nmovement and flow of \nmaterial through the factory", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2011.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
