Each year, more than 90 percent \nof our employees worldwide have completed the survey.Overall employee engagement fell a few percentage points in \n2010 (see table), yet that score is still considered a relative \nstrength by our external survey partner (anything in excess of 65 \npercent is considered a strength). That said, engagement scores \nwere mixed across the company. The scores of certain large \npopulations fell, which reduced the overall company score, \nalthough for numerous groups, engagement scores remained the \nsame or increased. Improving our overall engagement score \nremains a company priority for 2011.\nEMPLOYEE  ENGAGEMENT SCORE \n2007 2008 2009 2010\nEmployee Engagement* \n[percent]75% 78% 72% 68%\n*Represents the percentage of employees that responded favorably to three \nquestions that measure different aspects of employee engagement.\nBeyond the employee engagement score, the manager \neffectiveness score (which represents employees\u2019 assessments of \ntheir managers\u2019 capabilities in the areas of respect and leadership) \nremained high at 72 percent\u2014the same as the external 75th \npercentile norm.

Sixty-nine percent of \nrespondents stated they felt well-informed about Autodesk\u2019s \nactivities in this area.\nOpen-ended, anonymous survey comments (the review of which \nis restricted to executive staff only, to encourage employees to \nrespond freely) were in general very positive and showed an \noverarching sense of passion and excitement about the company, \nand a strong belief in co-workers.
