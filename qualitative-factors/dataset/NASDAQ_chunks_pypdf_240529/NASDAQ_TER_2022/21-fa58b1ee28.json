This new \nheadquarters is just down the road from the current  \nUR headquarters and not far from MiR\u2019s headquarters. \nMore than 600 employees of MiR and UR will move \ninto the new space, and the hub will bring together the \ninnovative power and robotics expertise of both teams \ninto one physical location. The space also provides the \nteams with room to grow. The building will be built with energy frame \nrequirements and consistent with Danish building \nregulations. It will have 3 layers of glass,  \nheat will be reused from extraction, feature a night \nsetback on heat, and the building will also have solar \npanels on its roof, totaling 715 square meters. \nThe new construction is mainly made of wood products \nfor sustainable living. We want to help build a great \nfuture by using wood to improve the sustainability of \nthe building. The FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) \nmark is a guarantee for wood that you can buy with \na clear conscience. In an FSC forest, no more wood is \nfelled than the forest can reproduce. \nThe new building will have native tree species and \nshrubs, which will be able to provide plantings that fit \nwell into the area\u2019s existing plant belts. To the east and \nwest, two attractive roof gardens will be installed.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TER_2022.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
