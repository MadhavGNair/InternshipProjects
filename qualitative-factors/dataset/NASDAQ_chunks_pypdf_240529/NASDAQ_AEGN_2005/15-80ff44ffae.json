Determining specific policies and targets continues\nto be the responsibility of management in local country units in\norder to ensure that those objectives reflect local circumstances.\n3.5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nAEGON engages with a wide array of stakeholders, both at \nthe corporate level and at the country level.
