The vitamins, provided through the Walgreens-Vitamin Angels partnership, helped supplement her limited diet. Her mother, the sole earner for her household, makes most of her money from weaving. Vitamin Angels partners with non-governmental organizations to provide life-changing vitamins and minerals for pregnant women, new mothers and children under five. Vitamin A deficiency, which is moderate in Guatemala, can cause blindness.\n\u201c Through partnering with \ncompanies that share our interests and goals for diversity, opportunity, and responsibility to society, we know that we will continue to move forward while helping others,\u201d says Alison Gutterman, owner of Jelmar, a woman-owned firm that supplies cleaning products and rust removers to Walgreens.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WBA_2016.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
