We \nprohibit retaliation of any kind against supplier \nemployees who participate in our assessments.\nOur goal is to work together with suppliers to \nhelp them improve their management systems, \nrather than to simply remove them from our \nsupply chain without helping them correct the \nissues we have discovered. In the event that a \nsupplier is unwilling or unable to improve their \noperations to meet our requirements, they risk \nremoval from our supply chain. Since 2009, we \nhave directed the removal of 24 manufacturing \nsupplier facilities and 170 smelters and refiners \nfrom our supply chain for being unwilling or \nunable to sufficiently improve their operations \nto meet our requirements.\nResults of our assessments are detailed in our \nPeople and Environment in Our Supply Chain \nReport  beginning on page 91.

We do this through a Corrective \nAction Plan (CAP), during which 30-, 60-, and \n90-day check-ins with Apple are required.  \nWe then conduct our Corrective Action \nVerification (CAV) process to verify that all \ncorrective actions have been successfully \nimplemented, and necessary steps have Code of conduct  \nassessments\nSpecialized  \nassessments\nInvestigations\nCapability buildingOngoing  \ntrainingEarly  \nengagement\nThese assessments also include unannounced \nassessments and unannounced visits \nin response to workers\u2019 grievances and \nallegations, or to verify risks at supplier facilities \nbased on predictive analytics.
