Since fiscal year 2020, 9 percent of \nprospective suppliers evaluated for Code-\nrelated risks have been prevented from entering \nour supply chain for being unable or unwilling to \nmeet our Code and Standards.\nOnce new suppliers are awarded Apple \nbusiness, we begin the process of helping them \nquickly get up to speed on our requirements \nthrough our supplier onboarding process.  \nIn 2021, we expanded our onboarding process \nto engage new suppliers at an even earlier \nstage in their working relationship with Apple.We also extend our support to help prospective \nsuppliers correct compliance issues found \nduring the procurement process \u2014 even when \nthe supplier is not awarded Apple\u2019s business \n\u2014 at no cost to the participating companies. \nSince 2020, 68 percent of companies that were \nnot awarded Apple business elected to join this \nvoluntary program, helping to protect people and \nthe planet beyond the reach of our business and \nsupply chain.\nSupplier engagement  \nand accountability\nWe take a broad, comprehensive approach \nto engaging with our suppliers to confirm that \nour standards are met. One of the tools that \nwe employ are assessments. Assessments, \nalso known as audits, are one of several \nmethods we use to measure compliance \nwith our requirements. These independent, \nthird-party assessments, which take place \nonsite at supplier facilities, provide a snapshot \nof a supplier\u2019s performance. However, when \ncombined with regular engagement with \nsupplier teams, mandated reporting, and \nlistening directly to hundreds of thousands \nof supplier employees about their workplace \nexperiences, our rigorous supplier assessments \nprovide a clear measure of their performance in \nupholding our Code and Standards.\nIn the 2021 reporting period, 1177 assessments \nwere conducted in 52 countries. This included \n886 Code of Conduct assessments and 291 \nsmelter and refiner assessments.20 Since 2007, \nApple-managed assessments have covered \n94 percent of our direct manufacturing spend.
