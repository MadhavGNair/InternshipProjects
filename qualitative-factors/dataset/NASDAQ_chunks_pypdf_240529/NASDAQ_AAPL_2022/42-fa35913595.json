We work from the earliest stages \nof product design to ensure that the materials, \nmachines, and processes used in the \nmanufacturing of our products prioritize the \nhealth and safety of the people working in our \nsupply chain.\nBuilding a culture of safety\nAmong many topics, our Code and Standards \ncover the safe handling of chemicals, \nemergency preparedness, health and safety \npermits, living and working conditions, and \nincident management. Health and safety is \nalso an important part of every assessment we \nconduct. Any instances of noncompliance with \nour Code and Standards during an assessment \nare addressed through customized Corrective \nAction Plans, online training materials, and \ncapability building with EHS experts in order \nto improve their future performance. In 2021, \nwe began development of a safety culture \nguide to help suppliers cultivate a deeper, more \nsustainable culture of safety in their facilities. \nHealth and wellness\nBeyond keeping people in our supply chain \nsafe, we\u2019re committed to creating workplaces \nwhere people can thrive. This means giving our \nsupplier employees the tools and resources to \nimprove their physical and mental health and \nwell-being.\nSince 2017, we\u2019ve helped make health \neducation and resources available to more than \n2.95 million supplier employees on topics such as reproductive health, disease prevention, \nand nutrition. In 2021, we conducted a needs \nassessment to give supplier employees an \nopportunity to share their feedback, and we \nare updating our resources with those results \nin mind. \nSafeguarding health  \nthrough safer chemistry\nOur commitment starts with setting and \nupholding strict material safety standards \nthat often go beyond regulatory requirements \nin order to protect human health and the \nenvironment. These are outlined in our Code \nand Standards and our Regulated Substances \nSpecification (RSS), and are derived from \ninternational laws or directives, regulatory \nagencies, eco-label requirements, and \nenvironmental standards. We then go further, \nby intentionally designing our products \nand manufacturing processes to use safer \nmaterials, as well as verifying that the correct \nhealth and safety protocols are being used \nacross our supply chain. And we\u2019re making an \nimpact beyond our supply chain by working \nwith others to help make the use of safer \nmaterials the industry norm.\nWe received the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency\u2019s (EPA) Safer Choice Partner of the \nYear Award for the second year in a row, \nin recognition of our leadership in safer \nchemistry.
