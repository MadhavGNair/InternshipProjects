Beginning in FY2021, we\u2019re accounting for the purchase of district heating, \nchilled water, and steam.\n2.   Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency \nsavings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. All efficiency measures \nare retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the \nCalifornia Energy Commission. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate \nfacilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate \ncontrols due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not \nincluded in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. \nWe also recognize that energy use at our employees\u2019 homes likely increased \nduring this period. We have not accounted for this energy use, because we \nanticipated this impact is small relative to our overall energy use and we are \nstill evolving our methodology. \n3.   Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reported \nas annualized annual numbers. Prior to 2020, supplier energy savings are \ncalculated on a calendar year basis. Beginning in 2020, supplier energy \nsavings are calculated based on the fiscal year. \n4.   Beginning January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our \nglobal facilities is sourced from renewable energy.\n5. Supply chain renewable electricity capacity (operational) and renewable \nelectricity use for FY2021 do not include REC purchases Apple made, \nequivalent to 0.3 GW and 500,000 MWh, respectively, to address a small \nincrease to its carbon footprint.\n Energy\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   79", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 78, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
