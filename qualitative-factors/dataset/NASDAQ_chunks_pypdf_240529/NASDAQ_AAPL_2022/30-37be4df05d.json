{"page_content": "Protecting each other\u2019s health\nAt every stage of the pandemic, our first \npriority has always been the health of our \nteams, customers, and communities. That \nmeant being one of the first companies to \nclose our offices and retail stores, and finding \ninnovative ways to connect with colleagues and \ncustomers virtually.\nSince 2020, we\u2019ve continued our efforts and \nprograms to support our people. We adopted \nCDC recommendations around up-to-date \nvaccinations, including booster doses. Apple \nalso continued to pay our teams during \ntemporary store and office closures, expanded \nour paid leave policies, and enhanced our \npolicies and procedures for a safe work \nenvironment \u2014 both in the office and in-store.To keep our teams informed, we deployed \ncomprehensive resources with up-to-date \nCOVID-19 information, including a dedicated \nplatform for teams returning to the office. \nCOVID-19 case support, implemented for \nall team members, included return-to-work \nguidance and contact tracing, with the utmost \nregard for employee privacy. We continue to \noffer special sick leave for employees with \npossible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as \ncomprehensive health coverage.\nTo continue to manage our response going \nforward, we created a dedicated pandemic \nresponse team in 2022 in addition to the \ncross-functional team that has been supporting \nand guiding our COVID response. The new \nresponse team will support future pandemic \nplanning and response.Innovating to support our customers\nDespite all of the pandemic\u2019s challenges, we \nbrought our hardware, software, and services \ninto customers\u2019 hands, helping them stay \ninformed, connected, and entertained.\nWe also tailored our services to promote easy \naccess to trusted information on COVID-19: \nlaunching a dedicated section on Apple News; \nprioritizing visibility of essential services \nlocations \u2014 including COVID-19 testing and \nvaccination locations \u2014 on Apple Maps; \noffering a curated collection of telehealth apps \non the App Store; and leveraging Siri to provide \nthe latest COVID-19 guidance.\nTo meet the extraordinary challenges of \nvirtual education, we delivered new content \nand services for students, parents, and \nteachers to foster creativity and learning \nin a digital environment. We worked with \nmobile carriers and school administrators \nto deliver iPad devices with cellular support \nfor students in need. With our Apple Card \nCustomer Assistance Program, we also offered \ncustomers the option to skip their monthly \npayments without incurring interest. \nAcross many of our Apple Store locations, \nwe were able to serve our customers\u2019 \nneeds through contactless pickup, express \nstorefronts, and new online support. Our \nresponse to COVID-19 is still ongoing, and \nwe\u2019re committed to implementing health \nprotocols and adjusting store operations as \nrequired based on available data and guidance \nfrom health officials.Apple\u2019s \nCOVID-19 \nresponse\nThe health of our teams, customers, and communities continues to be our first priority.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   31", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
