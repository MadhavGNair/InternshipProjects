In 2021, we anonymously \nsurveyed 264,963 supplier employees in \n191 facilities across Greater China, India, \nIreland, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, \nUK, U.S., and Vietnam about their workplace \nexperiences \u2014 nearly double the number of \nsupplier employees surveyed last fiscal year. \nAs a result, suppliers took 3944 actions, \nincluding better commute options, increasing \nwages and bonuses, offering better food \nvariety, and skill development opportunities \nfor entry-level managers.\nResponsible labor recruitment\nOur Code and Standards, and the protections \nthey provide, apply equally to all workers, \nregardless of a person\u2019s job, geographic \nlocation, or how they enter our supply chain \n\u2014 and this commitment begins even before \na worker ever enters our supply chain. This \nincludes zero tolerance for forced labor. We implement strict policies and procedures \nwith our suppliers to protect workers in our \nsupply chain from forced labor. This includes \nselecting suppliers for assessments based \non factors, such as their geographic location, \nwhich may put them at higher risk of forced \nlabor violations, as well as their previous \nperformance and/or history of violations or \nallegations. Suppliers may also receive additional \nspecialized assessments based on the nature \nof their business or employee population, such \nas those that employ Foreign Contract Workers, \nand those located in higher risk migration \ncorridors. Our Code and Standards also require \nthat all supplier employees have an effective \nmechanism to report grievances. In addition, \nwe provide third-party anonymous hotlines and \nthe ability to contact the Apple Environment and \nSupply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at \nany time and in any language. When an issue \nis raised, supplier management is required to \npromptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a \ntimely manner.\nWe strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor \nthroughout our worldwide supply chain and look \nfor evidence of it in every supplier assessment \nwe conduct, including unannounced \nassessments. Last year, we conducted more \nthan 1100 assessments, and found no instances \nwhere anyone was forced to work in our \nsupply chain. We did discover two cases in Taiwan in which \npeople paid recruitment fees to secure their \njob, which is a violation of our Code. We \nrequired the supplier to directly repay their \nemployees in full, and verified repayment \nthrough a third-party auditor. The payment of \nrecruitment fees, withholding an employee\u2019s \npassport or personal identity documents, \nor restricting an employee\u2019s freedom of \nmovement are Core Violations of our Code \nand Standards \u2014 the most serious level of \nCode violations. If we discover workers have \npaid recruitment fees at any point on their \nemployment journey to an Apple supplier, we \nrequire supplier management to take prompt \naction to provide remedy to those affected \nby directly repaying their workers for any and \nall fees, even if the supplier was unaware \nthat their employees had paid recruitment \nfees. From 2008 through fiscal year 2021, \nour suppliers have repaid $33.2 million in \nrecruitment fees directly to 37 ,322 workers.\nFinally, in collaboration with the International \nOrganization for Migration (IOM) and the \nResponsible Business Alliance (RBA), we \nexpanded our Responsible Labor Recruitment \nToolkit to more than 39 additional supplier \nfacilities in 10 countries, reaching nearly 77 ,000 \nworkers globally, with 66 percent of those \nworking on Apple production lines.23.6M \nsupplier employees trained on their  \nrights since 2008 \n352,589\nsupplier employees directly engaged about \ntheir workplace experiences, through \ninterviews and satisfaction surveys\n220,000\nsupplier employees reached by grievance \nhotline awareness campaign\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   41", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 40, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
