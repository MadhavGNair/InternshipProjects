We define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority of which \ncomes from municipal sources and less than 5 percent comes from onsite \ngroundwater sources.\n2.   Recycled water represents a key alternative water source. Our recycled \nwater is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than \n5 percent from onsite treatment. Recycled water is primarily used for \nirrigation, make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing.\n3.   Other alternative sources of water include rainwater and recovered \ncondensate that is captured onsite. Water used for construction activities \nlike dust control is not included in this total, and represents 13 million \ngallons of water used in fiscal year 2021.\n4.   Total does not include construction and demolition waste nor electronic \nwaste. We\u2019re refining our methodology for collecting this data and plan to \ninclude it in future years. We have also re-stated the total for 2018 without \nthese categories of waste.\n5.   Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple\u2019s Sustainable Fiber \nSpecification. Since 2017, all of the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging \nhas come from responsible sources.
