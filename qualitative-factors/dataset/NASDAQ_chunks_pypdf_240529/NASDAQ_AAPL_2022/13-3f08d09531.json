In 2021, we \ncontinued to improve the carbon efficiency of \nthe integrated circuits we use in our products \n\u2014 components we\u2019ve prioritized because they \nare carbon-intensive. For example, switching \nto the Apple M1 chip for the 13-inch MacBook \nPro reduced the energy needed to manufacture \nand use the device, driving down the product\u2019s \ncarbon footprint by over 8 percent.\nWe\u2019ve continued to expand our use of \n100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures \nof a number of products. All iPad models in our \nlineup now use 100 percent recycled aluminum \nin their enclosures \u2014 joining Apple Watch \nSeries 7, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac \nmini, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro \ndevices. For products released in 2021 that had \nenclosures made with primary aluminum, we Energy efficiency\nWe\u2019re focused on using less energy across \nour operations, beginning with how we design, \noperate, and maintain our facilities. And we \ncontinue these same efforts into our supply \nchain, which benefits the communities where \nour suppliers operate. Drawing less energy from \nelectrical grids \u2014 many of which still rely heavily \non fossil fuels \u2014 helps reduce local air pollution \nand improve air quality for nearby communities.\nThe emissions from manufacturing our products \naccount for about 70 percent of Apple\u2019s gross \ncarbon footprint. We launched our Supplier Energy \nEfficiency Program in 2015 with the goal of helping \nsuppliers optimize their facilities and operations \nto use as little energy as possible. We provide \nguidance designed to help suppliers uncover \nopportunities for energy efficiency. Suppliers in \nour Supplier Energy Efficiency Program avoided \nmore than 1,150,000 annualized metric tons of \nsupply chain carbon emissions in fiscal year 2021.40%\ndecrease in emissions across our \nentire value chain since 2015\n100%\nrenewable energy sourced for all \nApple facilities\n213\nsuppliers committed to \n100 percent renewable electricity \nfor Apple production\n$4.7B\nissued in green bonds to model how \nbusinesses can drive investments \nto reduce global emissions. In our \nlatest Green Bond Impact Report , \nwe share progress on the projects \nfunded in fiscal year 2021.\nTo minimize the carbon footprint of our products, we seek to create less waste in the processing of materials,  \nreduce machining time and the associated energy used, more efficiently transform material into the shapes  \nwe need, and maximize recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap. \nprioritized the use of aluminum smelted using \nlow-carbon sources of electricity rather than \nfossil fuels \u2014 for a lower carbon impact. These \nchanges alone have decreased the carbon \nemissions associated with our use of aluminum \nby 68 percent since 2015.\nProduct energy use accounts for 22 percent  \nof our gross carbon footprint \u2014 and has an \nimpact on the individual energy use of each  \nof our customers. By addressing this in the \nearliest phases of design, we\u2019ve cut the product \nenergy use across all major product lines by \nmore than 70 percent since 2008 through \nenergy efficiency improvements.3 In fiscal \nyear 2021, over 99 percent of Apple\u2019s eligible \nproducts, by revenue, received an ENERGY \nSTAR rating for superior energy efficiency.4  \nAnd over 99 percent of Apple\u2019s eligible \nproducts, by revenue, met the requirements  \nfor EPEAT registration.5\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   14", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
