{"page_content": "Supporting people in our supply chain\nWe are continuing to work together with our \nsuppliers to help them ensure that every \nnecessary precaution is taken to keep people \nsafe at work. In 2020, we introduced an \nenhancement to our Code and Standards \nspecifically addressing Infectious Disease \nPreparedness and Response (IDPR). IDPR \ncontains a set of new requirements resulting \nfrom our learnings during the pandemic, which \nwill help our suppliers better prepare for and \nbe ready to respond to an infectious disease \noutbreak at their facility. As part of the rollout \nof IDPR in fiscal year 2021, we conducted \nmore than 200 onsite and remote specialized \nassessments to verify suppliers\u2019 compliance \nwith COVID-19 control protocols in order to \ndrive improvement when necessary.\nWe also continue to assess any existing gaps \nat supplier facilities, and identify opportunities \nto work with those in higher-risk areas to \nhelp make their facilities safer. This includes \nworking with third-party suppliers to redesign \nand reconfigure factory floor plans where \nnecessary, implementing flexible working hours \nto maximize interpersonal space, implementing \nenhanced deep cleaning protocols, and \ndeploying masks and sanitizers. In fiscal year \n2021, we also encouraged our suppliers\u2019 \nemployees to get vaccinated and boosted \nwhere available.\nWe also partnered with NGOs to help further \nsupport supplier employees, as well as those \nworking deeper in our supply chain, particularly \nthose from vulnerable groups. We worked with \nthe International Organization for Migration \n(IOM) \u2014 the world\u2019s leading organization \nproviding services to migrant workers \u2014 to \nprovide support to migrant workers impacted by the pandemic. With support from Apple, \nour long-time partner Pact, an international \ndevelopment organization, prepared and \ncoordinated activities to prevent the spread of \nCOVID-19 in several mining communities in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The \ninitiative has reached more than 50,000 people \nthrough individual and group dialogues on \nCOVID-19 prevention since the program began \nin December 2020.\nGiving back to our communities\nApple\u2019s company-wide response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic involved teams across \nthe business, including product design, \nengineering, operations, packaging teams, \nsuppliers, and more. At the beginning of the \npandemic, when personal protective equipment \nwas in short supply, we sourced through our \nsupply chain and donated more than 30 million \nmasks for healthcare workers worldwide. \nWe also launched a company-wide effort to \nproduce and ship over 10 million face shields. \nThese face shields were delivered to sites \naround the world, from New York Presbyterian \nHospital in the U.S. to the Ministry of Health \nin Zambia. \nAdditionally, we have also donated over \n$10 million to the World Health Organization\u2019s \nCOVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. We also \nmatched employee donations two-to-one to \nsupport COVID-19 response efforts worldwide. \nWe awarded $10 million from our Advanced \nManufacturing Fund to COPAN diagnostics, \na market leader in sample collection kits, \nthat rapidly accelerated their ability to supply \nsample collection kits to hospitals in the U.S. \nfor COVID-19 testing. And our partnership \nwith Product (RED) also supported COVID-19 \nresponse (see page  65).\nCollaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure they\u2019re taking every necessary \nprecaution to keep people safe at work. In partnership with the White House \nCoronavirus Task Force and the CDC, we \nreleased an app and a website that guided \nAmericans through a series of questions about \ntheir health and exposure to determine if they \nshould seek care for COVID-19 symptoms, \nproviding CDC recommendations on next \nsteps, including guidance on social distancing \nand self -isolating, how to closely monitor symptoms, recommendations on testing, \nand when to contact a medical provider. \nAnd we collaborated with Google to create a \nnew exposure notification system for global \ngovernments and health agencies, with user \nprivacy and security central to its design, to \nhelp fight the pandemic.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   32", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
