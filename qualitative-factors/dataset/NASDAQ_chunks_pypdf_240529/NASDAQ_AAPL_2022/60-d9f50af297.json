Through mentorship and financial \ninvestments, we back founders who have \nhistorically been cut out of opportunities \nto access capital in order to achieve \neconomic prosperity. \nSince 2021, we\u2019ve announced $75 million \nin financial commitments to support Black, \nHispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous entrepreneurs, \nbusinesses, and financial institutions. \nThese include $25 million in venture capital \ninvestments in three Black- and Hispanic/\nLatinx-founded firms \u2014 Harlem Capital, \nVamosVentures, and Collab Capital. And \n$25 million of our commitment is to Siebert \nWilliams Shank\u2019s Clear Vision Impact Fund, \nwhich works to increase loan capital for \nsmall- and medium-size minority-owned \nbusinesses and underserved communities. \nWe also committed $25 million to expand \naccess to capital for financial institutions \nsupporting communities of color in historically \nunderserved markets across the U.S. through \nCNote\u2019s Impact Cash product.Through our Impact Accelerator, we\u2019re taking \nsteps to help better position businesses led by \npeople of color to benefit from investments in \ngreen technology and clean energy, bringing \ntogether our commitments to equity and the \nenvironment. Launched in 2020, the Impact \nAccelerator is a three-month virtual program \nthat includes customized training along with \naccess to Apple expert mentors and a growing \nalumni community \u2014 to expand participants\u2019 \nopportunities within Apple\u2019s supply chain. \nRead more about the first class of the Impact \nAccelerator on page  18.\nWe are also supporting economic \nempowerment for communities of color \nthrough two of our existing programs, \nEntrepreneur Camp (see page 64 ) and Apple \nDeveloper Academy (see page 63 ). In early \n2022, Entrepreneur Camp welcomed its first \ncohort of Hispanic/Latinx founders. And in \nOctober 2021, we partnered with Michigan \nState University to open an Apple Developer \nAcademy in Detroit, a city with a vibrant Black \nentrepreneur and developer community and \nover 50,000 minority-owned businesses.\nOur work to provide access and opportunity \nto communities of color extends to our own \nbusiness activities, including supporting \ninclusion and diversity among our employees \n(see page 23 ) and increasing Apple\u2019s spend \nwith diverse suppliers (see page  45).African American Male Teacher Initiative  \nat Huston-Tillotson University\nCurrently, only 2 percent of all U.S. teachers are Black men, something the \nprogram at Huston-Tillotson is working to change. When Black students are \ntaught by a Black teacher, they\u2019re significantly more likely to graduate from high \nschool and consider attending college. To support Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s \nAfrican American Male Teacher Initiative, Apple is providing scholarships for the \nprogram\u2019s students, called Pre-Ed Scholars, as well as hardware, software, and \nprofessional development courses for students and faculty. Apple\u2019s multiyear \npartnership with Huston-Tillotson complements other engagements we\u2019ve \nestablished through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, working alongside  \nthe HBCU community to develop curricula and provide new learning and \nworkforce opportunities.\nUsing FaceTime, Rhys Richard chats with his music professor, Dr. Samuel Rowley, as part \nof his coursework at Huston-Tillotson University.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   61", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 60, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
