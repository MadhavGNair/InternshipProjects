In \naddition to our stock program and wide range \nof benefits we provide, we regularly review our \ncompetitive position to establish our leading \nstarting pay rates in each local market.\nApple stock ownership \nIn 2015, we introduced our Stock Ownership \nProgram, which was designed to reach \nemployees who were not previously eligible for \nrestricted stock unit (RSU) awards, including \nall of our retail and AppleCare teams. By the \nend of 2022, over $1.1 billion of RSU grants will \nhave been awarded under this program, and \nthe shares underlying the RSUs today would \nhave an estimated value of over $3 billion \n(based on a share price of $130.06 as of June \n16, 2022). Apple is one of the few companies \nin the S&P 500, and the largest technology \ncompany, in which employees at all levels are \neligible for RSU grants on an annual basis. In \n2021, 150,000 employees were eligible for \nRSU grants and our Compensation Committee \napproved grants for 99% of those eligible. In most countries, employees also get discounts \nwhen purchasing Apple stock by participating \nin the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). \nCurrently, 81 percent of eligible employees \nparticipate in the ESPP.\nESG Modifier\nBeginning in 2021, the Compensation \nCommittee incorporated the ESG Modifier \ninto the Executive annual cash incentive \nprogram. The ESG Modifier is based on a \nholistic evaluation by the Compensation \nCommittee of key accomplishments and \nactions taken during the year to advance \nour Apple values: accessibility, education, \nenvironment, inclusion and diversity, privacy, \nand supplier responsibility, and key community \ninitiatives which were chosen because they \nrepresent long-standing, business-relevant \nenvironmental, social, and governance \nprinciples that reflect Apple\u2019s commitment to \npromoting values-driven leadership.\nPay equity \nSince 2017, Apple has achieved and maintained \ngender pay equity for our employees worldwide. \nIn the U.S., we\u2019ve also achieved pay equity with \nrespect to race and ethnicity \u2014 as well as pay \nequity at the intersections of race and ethnicity \nwith gender.*\nIn addition to our pay equity commitment, \nour Inclusion and Diversity program (see \npage 23 ) supports growth, development, \nand engagement for team members of \nall backgrounds.\nWe have a number of practices in place \nto support our commitment to pay \nequity, including: \n* Pay equity at the intersections of race and ethnicity \nwith gender was achieved in 2022.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   28", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
