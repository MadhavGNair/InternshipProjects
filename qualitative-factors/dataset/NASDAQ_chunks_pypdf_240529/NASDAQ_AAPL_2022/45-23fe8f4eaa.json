{"page_content": "Apple helps suppliers rapidly accelerate renewable  \nenergy use around the\u00a0world\nIn April 2022, Apple announced that its suppliers more than doubled their use \nof clean power over the last year, with over 10 gigawatts operational today out \nof nearly 16 gigawatts in total commitments in the coming years. In 2021, these \nrenewable projects avoided 13.9 million metric tons of carbon emissions. The \nprojects online today will support greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to \nremoving 3 million cars from the road for one year.\nApple is constantly working with its global supply chain to accelerate and \nsupport its transition to clean energy. As of March 2022, 213 of the company\u2019s \nmajor manufacturing partners have pledged to power all Apple production with \nrenewable electricity across 25 countries. The dozens of new commitments \nannounced this year will accelerate progress toward Apple\u2019s 2030 goal to \nbecome carbon neutral across its entire supply chain.\nU.S., China, India, and Vietnam, more than \n100,000 supplier employees will participate \nin new learning opportunities by 2023 \u2014 from \nleadership training and technical certifications, \nto classes on coding, robotics, and advanced \nmanufacturing fundamentals.\nInternal leadership  \nand technical programs\nWe work consistently to provide meaningful \neducational opportunities that enrich supplier \nemployees\u2019 workplace experiences and provide \nopportunities to improve career paths. Over the \npast five years, more than 5000 students have \nparticipated in our Line Leader, Automation \nTechnician, and general apprenticeship \nprograms. These programs give participants \nthe skills they need to pursue opportunities in \nhighly technical roles. In 2021, 5883 supplier \nemployees at 18 supplier sites participated \nin technical training, including programs on \nrobotics, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) \nmachines, and mobile device repair.\nCoding \nSince 2017, we\u2019ve offered training to supplier \nemployees on Apple\u2019s Swift coding language \n\u2014 a skill that is in high demand. In 2021, we \ncontinued to build on feedback from students \nand suppliers to refine our curriculum by adding \nmore opportunities for virtual learning while \nmaintaining the quality and consistency of \nthe programs.Environment\nHuman rights and environmental protection \nare inextricably linked. And we\u2019re taking action \naccordingly. As we build products that enrich \nthe lives of people around the world, we have \na profound responsibility to do so in a way that \nminimizes our resource use while protecting the \nlocal environments and communities where we \nand our suppliers operate.\nWe work with our suppliers to help us address \nour environmental commitments, including our \ngoal to become carbon neutral by 2030 across \nour entire product footprint. Our Supplier Energy \nEfficiency Program and Supplier Clean Energy \nProgram both address direct and indirect \nemissions in our supply chain, while our Supplier \nClean Water and Zero Waste programs help to \nreduce resource usage.\nIn addition, our Code contains strict \nenvironmental protections, which require our \nsuppliers to understand and take active steps \nto reduce their environmental impact while also \nbecoming better stewards of the resources \nwe all share and the communities in which \nwe operate. Specifically, our Code addresses \nthe management of regulated substances, \nstormwater, wastewater, air emissions, waste, \nand noise, as well as pollution prevention, \nresource reduction, and obtaining necessary \nenvironmental permits.\nMore detail about our environment work in the \nsupply chain is covered on page 13 , as well as \nin People and Environment in Our Supply Chain \nReport  and the Environmental Progress  Report .\nApple has invested in the 2300-acre IP Radian Solar project in Brown County, Texas.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   46", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
