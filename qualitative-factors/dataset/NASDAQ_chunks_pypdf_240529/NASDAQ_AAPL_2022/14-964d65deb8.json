In fiscal year 2021, we avoided over 23 million \nmetric tons of emissions across all scopes. Initiatives that \nwe\u2019ve been growing for years \u2014 like sourcing 100 percent \nrenewable electricity for our facilities, transitioning suppliers \nto clean energy, and using low-carbon materials in products \n\u2014 yielded indisputable results. \nThanks to this work, we\u2019ve begun to decouple business \ngrowth from emissions: While our revenue grew 33 percent, \nour emissions grew by less than 5 percent. To mitigate this \nincrease in emissions, we applied an additional 0.6 million \ntons of renewable energy credits (RECs) and 0.5 million \nmetric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally cover \nelectricity use and direct emissions, respectively, across our \nvalue chain. This represents a short-term bridging solution \nas we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet the \nscale of the challenge.\n* Low-carbon materials represents emissions savings from transitioning to recycled materials in our products, or use of low-carbon aluminum, as described on page  18. \n**  Net carbon emissions represents our total gross footprint minus carbon offsets applied to each category. Percentages shown for each emissions category represent the share of Apple\u2019s gross footprint. Totals add up to more than 100 percent, due to rounding.22.5 million metric tons  \nnet carbon emissions **\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   15", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
