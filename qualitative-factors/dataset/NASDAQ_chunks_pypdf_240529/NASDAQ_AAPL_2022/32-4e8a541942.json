{"page_content": "Health and safety at Apple \nWe\u2019re dedicated to protecting our team \nmembers and our customers everywhere \nwe operate \u2014 a responsibility COVID-19 has \nbrought into even greater focus. At every \nstage of the pandemic, we\u2019ve made decisions \nbased on the latest local data and public health \nguidance, and we share lessons across our \nEnvironment, Health, and Safety (EHS) teams \nglobally so we can continuously improve our \nsafety programs. \nProtecting our people \nWe\u2019re always working hard to make sure our \nworkers are safe no matter where they are \nwhen they\u2019re conducting business for Apple. \nWe abide by EHS requirements in every country \nwhere we operate and are dedicated to doing \neverything we can to support the safety and \nwell-being of our global teams. \nManaging work-related hazards and risks \nTo help ensure the safety of our workers and \ncustomers, we put procedures in place to \nidentify workplace risks and mitigate possible \nhazards. We support and protect employees \nin lower hazard spaces, and we put risk-\nspecific programs in place for those working \nin higher hazard environments, including safe \nsystems of work, chemical management, \nlaser safety, equipment and machinery safety, \nhazardous materials management, and \nelectrical safety. Employees can request to \nhave their workspaces individually inspected \nto review hazards and controls, including \nergonomics evaluations. Apple implements a hierarchy of control \nfor significant risks, which centers on \nelimination, substitution, engineering controls, \nadministrative controls, and personal protective \nequipment (PPE).\nAs one example, Apple EHS regularly assesses \nhazards at our research labs based on their \nchemical, equipment, laser, and other hazards. \nApproximately 9 percent of our labs are \nconsidered \u201ccomplex,\u201d meaning that they \ncontain high-hazard processes and equipment. \nThese assessments help teams understand \nwhich EHS programs and controls must be \nput in place to mitigate risks. In 2021, Apple \ncompleted hazard assessments in over 2500 \nresearch labs globally.\nOur EHS teams identify and provide team \nmembers with appropriate PPE for specific \nhazards. This PPE is provided at no cost and \nwith training on correct use. For example, \nour hearing conservation programs include \nevaluation and control of occupational \nexposures to noise, and hearing protection is \navailable for processes, areas, and tasks with \npotential high noise exposures. Additionally, \nEHS conducts mandatory health checks for \nemployees where they\u2019re needed.\nWe invest in new technologies as we continue \nto manage potential risks across our operations, \nincluding our Apple-owned manufacturing \nsites. Our standards, programs, trainings, \nprocedures, and other safeguards are managed \nby trained EHS professionals, and where \nrequired, we also translate EHS procedures into \nlocal languages for our team members. Risks identified from incidents, injuries, and \nnon-routine events are addressed expeditiously \nto identify and implement appropriate \ncorrective and preventative actions, and we \nintegrate our learnings into future program \ndevelopment and training. Lessons learned \nare routinely communicated across Apple\u2019s \nEHS team and potentially affected operations, \nand they are used to inform updates to existing \npolicies and procedures.\nEmployees and managers can report incidents, \nnear-misses, and observations \u2014 including \nnewly identified hazards and risks\u2014through \nan internal iOS app. Incident responses are \naddressed by Apple\u2019s EHS team through a \nconsistent process that connects employees \nwith care and support, while identifying \ncorrective actions where appropriate to prevent \nfuture occurrences. \nWaste management\nApple is committed to minimizing resource \nuse and the associated generation of non-\nhazardous or hazardous waste. Where \npossible, Apple implements a waste hierarchy \nof prevention, waste reduction at the source, \nreuse of materials, recycling, energy recovery, \nand landfilling as a last resort.\nWe maintain our commitment to the safe and \nresponsible management of hazardous waste, \nboth onsite and offsite. Any facility that does \nnot meet our requirements is replaced by \nanother approved waste management facility.\nWe made progress in 2021 at sites around \nthe world:U.S.:  Thirteen of the Treatment, Storage, and \nDisposal Facilities (TSDFs) we utilize in the U.S. \nwere audited in 2021 to confirm that the waste \nis treated, recycled, or incinerated within the \ngoverning safety standards for health and the \nenvironment. Eight disposal facility reviews \nwere completed by vendors under Apple \nmanagement, and we reviewed five other sites \nvia third-party audit reports. At one of our major \nresearch labs in Santa Clara Valley, the empty \ncontainer management program resulted in a \n3 percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous \nwaste streams.\nUnited Kingdom:  Through an internal initiative \nto further strengthen waste management, \nproduct site-specific waste initiatives \nachieved a 97 percent diversion from landfill \nand a 0.4 tonnes of waste/1002, both \nexceeding requirements.\nIreland:  The Cork Campus is ECVP 2799 Zero \nWaste to Landfill Certified annually and has had \nno material landfilled in the past five years.\nErgonomics\nIn 2021, we continued to support our global \nteam members working from home office, \nApple office, and non-office settings. \nThe Apple ergonomics program is heavily \nfocused on preventative measures to reduce \nthe risk of work-related musculoskeletal \ndisorders (WMSDs). This includes ergonomics \ntraining sessions for our team members and \nproviding input into the purchase or design \nof work equipment, systems, and facilities to \nensure that they meet ergonomic standards to \nprovide the best levels of efficiency, comfort, \nhealth, and safety for anyone using them.
