{"page_content": "Smarter chemistry\nThe well-being of our employees, customers, \npeople in our supply chain, and the planet \nis a priority for Apple, which is why we\u2019re \ncommitted to using safer materials to create \nsafer products. This commitment requires \ndiligent work \u2014 to build a comprehensive \npicture of chemicals across our supply chain, \nto insist on rigorous chemical management \nprocesses, to promote adoption of safer \nchemical alternatives, and to innovate through \ndesign smarter approaches to making our \nproducts. Using safer chemistry in our \nproducts also enables recycling and material \nrecovery, so that our products can be the raw \nmaterials for the next generation.The pillars of our smarter chemistry \nstrategy are:\nMapping and engagement:  Engage our \nsupply chain partners to comprehensively \nidentify the chemicals in the materials used  \nto make our products, allowing us to drive \nchange that goes beyond what is required  \nfor regulatory compliance.\nAssessment and management:  Assess the \npotential human health and environmental risks \nof chemicals to evaluate compliance with our \nrequirements and inform product design.\nInnovation:  Drive the development and use  \nof innovative materials that enable the creation \nof groundbreaking products and also support \nindustrywide change.\nMapping and engagement\nOur Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program \nmaps the chemicals used in our products \u2014 \nan effort that includes tens of thousands of \nparts and assemblies. Then we look at how \nour products are manufactured. Our Chemical \nSafety Disclosure (CSD) program engages with \nsupply chain partners to get the most recent \ninformation on which materials are in use.  \nThis information includes the volume of \nmaterials being consumed and how they\u2019re \nbeing applied, stored, and handled \u2014 as well  \nas the steps being taken to protect employees.\nMore than 1000 supplier facilities have shared \ntheir chemical inventories as well as storage and \nsafety protocols as part of our CSD program. \nThrough this process, we\u2019ve identified more \nthan 17 ,000 chemicals and applications. These \nefforts contribute to a safer work environment \nfor people across our supply chain.Zero waste\nAcross our corporate operations, we\u2019re reducing \nthe amount of waste we generate and directing \nmore toward recycling programs. In fiscal \nyear 2021, recycling and composting efforts \nallowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of \n68 percent, limiting landfill waste from our global \noperations to about 15,000 metric tons.12 Our \noverall waste generated also remained low, in \npart due to COVID-related temporary closure \nof facilities. Last year, our Mesa, Arizona, data \ncenter became the second Apple facility to \nreceive TRUE certification for zero waste, \nfollowing the Prineville data center in 2020.13\nApple works with the Alliance for Water Stewardship and others to promote water stewardship that protects \nthe health of water basins, including the Kunshan watershed in China.100+\nApple supplier facilities  \nare zero waste verified\n2M+\nmetric tons of waste redirected from \nlandfill by supplier facilities as part of \nApple\u2019s Zero Waste Program\nRead more about our efforts to conserve \nresources in our 2022 Environmental  \nProgress Report\nWe\u2019ve partnered with our suppliers, recyclers, \nand waste solution providers to eliminate waste \nfrom our manufacturing processes. At the close \nof fiscal year 2021, more than 100 facilities \nhad been zero waste verified \u2014 nearly half of \nthe supplier facilities that are part of our Zero \nWaste Program.14 All participating facilities \nacross 12 countries can access resources \nincluding guidance on how to reduce waste and \nthen reuse, recycle, or compost the waste they \ndo create. And we\u2019re seeing results: In fiscal \nyear 2021, suppliers redirected 491,000 metric \ntons of waste from landfills, bringing the total to \nover 2 million metric tons since the program\u2019s \ninception \u2014 the equivalent of eliminating more \nthan 2.5 million square meters of landfill space.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   20", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
