{"page_content": "Education\nFor more than 40 years, we\u2019ve worked \nalongside educators to inspire the next \ngeneration of learners, supporting creativity, \nproblem-solving, communication, and \ncollaboration. We believe that education can \nbe a great equalizing force, and our goal is to \nempower all educators and learners through \ntechnology that protects student privacy and is \naccessible for all learners.\nWe develop products, programs, tools, and \ncurricula for educators to create engaging \nlearning experiences, and we support \neducation leaders and administrators so they \ncan get the most out of the technology in the \nclassroom and beyond. \nCoding is a universal language, and a great  \nway to help students think critically and express \ntheir creativity. We\u2019re always working to make  \nit easy and fun to learn to code, with supportive \nresources like Swift Playgrounds and the \nEveryone Can Code curriculum. And we work \nhand in hand with communities \u2014 particularly \ncommunities of color and others that are under-\nresourced \u2014 to bring coding, creating, and \nentrepreneurship opportunities to learners  \nof all ages.\nProducts for learning\nKnowing that everyone has their own way \nof learning and expressing themselves, we \noffer products that support students and \neducators from kindergarten through higher \neducation. iPad provides apps and advanced \ntechnologies that help educators teach and \nstudents push the boundaries of their creativity. \nThe Augmented Reality capabilities on iPad let students bring digital objects into the real world \nto spark curiosity and enhance understanding \nin new, exciting ways. And the powerful Mac \nprocessors are equipped for the most intensive \ntasks, throughout university and far beyond.\nWe also developed Apple School Manager, \na free web-based portal that helps IT \nadministrators in K\u201312 and higher education \ninstitutions effortlessly configure, deploy,  \nand manage iPad and Mac devices.\nTeaching tools\nOur teaching tools empower educators to \npersonalize the learning experience for each \nstudent and manage the classroom to keep \nevery student on task. Our Classroom app serves \nas a powerful teaching assistant that makes it \neasy to navigate lessons and share information, \nwhile the Schoolwork app aids the distribution \nand collection of assignments, tracks progress, \nand supports collaboration with students.\nCurricula and project guides\nOur programs help educators integrate \ncreativity and coding into their lessons, even  \nif they\u2019re new to teaching with technology:\nEveryone Can Create: Gives educators \nfun and meaningful ways to bring creative \nexpression into any lesson, topic, or \nassignment. The free guides teach students \nto develop and communicate ideas through \ndrawing, photography, video, and music, while \nteacher guides help educators integrate both \ntechnology and creativity into every\u00a0lesson.\nEveryone Can Code: Guides students through \nthe Swift Playgrounds app on iPad and Mac. \nThis free curriculum and the app teach coding \nfor kids through a world of interactive puzzles Expanding horizons with Inclusive App Design\nEducators can also try Apple\u2019s new one-hour Inclusive App Design activity to introduce \nstudents to the world of coding and app development. During Europe Code Week in \nOctober 2021 and through Computer Science Education Week in December 2021, Apple \nencouraged educators and their students to participate in an introductory Inclusive App \nDesign activity. This new lesson from Apple helps educators guide students through a one-\nhour session to turn their ideas into apps with inclusion and accessibility in mind. The app \ndesign process helps students identify problems they care about, and then plan, prototype, \nand code creative solutions. It helps students think critically about how to build apps that \nare inclusive for all and prepares them to be the innovators of tomorrow.\nand playful characters, and introduce Swift, \nthe same programming language used by \nprofessional app developers. Teacher guides \nsupport educators in teaching code, even if \nthey have no experience.\nDevelop in Swift: Teaches students ages 14 \nand over how to use Swift for designing and \ndeveloping apps through Apple\u2019s integrated \ndevelopment environment, Xcode. In 2020, we \nlaunched a free online course taught by Apple \nexperts that helps instructors learn to teach \nSwift and Xcode.Learn more  about how Apple empowers \neducators and learners of all ages.\nRead more  about Apple\u2019s community \neducation initiatives in Communities ( page 62 ).\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   53", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 52, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
