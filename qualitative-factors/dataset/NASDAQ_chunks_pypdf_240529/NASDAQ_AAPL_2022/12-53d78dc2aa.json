{"page_content": "Climate change\nAs a global business, we believe it is our \nresponsibility to take strong, decisive, and \ninclusive steps to mitigate our climate impact. \nWe\u2019ve committed to achieving carbon neutrality \n\u2014 reducing emissions 75 percent compared \nwith fiscal year 2015 and balancing the residual \nemissions with carbon removal \u2014 across the \nlife cycle of all of our products by 2030.1 And \nthe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has \nvalidated an emissions reduction target for Apple \nderived from this goal.2 It\u2019s an ambitious plan with \nplenty of challenges ahead. But we\u2019re already \nwell on our way, having cut carbon emissions \nacross our value chain by 40 percent since  \nfiscal year 2015.\nOur work began years ago, making the transition \nto sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity \nat our offices, retail stores, and data centers, At Apple, we\u2019re acting with urgency to protect our planet\u2019s limited resources and to be  \na leader in the fight against climate change. Since 2020, we\u2019ve been carbon neutral for \nour worldwide operations, and by 2030, we plan to expand that progress to our entire \nsupply chain and the lifetime use of our products. And today, nearly 20 percent of the \nmaterials in our products were made from recycled content \u2014 a number we\u2019re working \nto\u00a0increase.\nAcross our environmental work, we\u2019re also committed to being a force for equity. We\u2019re \nworking with communities on the frontlines of climate change and the next generation  \nof diverse entrepreneurs to create shared opportunity and to build a more just world.\nOur approach\nThe environmental challenges we face today \nare significant, and we\u2019re responding with \nurgency and dedication. We approach our work \nby focusing on fundamental questions. What \nmatters most? And where can we make the \ngreatest impact? These questions guide our \nwork across our strategic focus areas of climate \nchange, resources, and smarter chemistry \n\u2014 and inform our goals in how we can best \nachieve change.  We know we\u2019re not alone in working to reduce \nour environmental footprint. So we\u2019re engaging \nwith others to support our efforts and find \nopportunities to lift local communities along \nthe way. \nSetting ambitious goals is essential to our \napproach \u2014 to drive the innovation and \ncollaboration that makes change possible \nand to be transparent and accountable to \nour progress.\nOur work is led by Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s Vice \nPresident of Environment, Policy and Social \nInitiatives, reporting directly to CEO Tim \nCook. The Environment, Policy and Social \nInitiatives team works with other teams across \nApple to set strategy, engage stakeholders, \nand communicate progress. Our integrated \napproach means that decisions about the \nenvironment are reviewed and supported  \nat the highest levels of the company.Our 2022 Environmental Progress Report  \nprovides a detailed overview of our work and  \nhow we\u2019re progressing toward our goals.which we achieved in 2018. And in 2020, we \nreached the milestone of being carbon neutral \nfor our corporate operations, including direct \nemissions as well as business travel and \nemployee commute.\nOur 10-year Climate Roadmap is addressing \nApple\u2019s carbon footprint through five pillars:\nLow-carbon design:  We will design products \nand manufacturing processes to be less \ncarbon-intensive through thoughtful material \nselection, increased material efficiency, and \ngreater product energy efficiency.\nEnergy efficiency:  We will increase energy \nefficiency at our facilities and in our supply \nchain by finding opportunities, such as \nretrofitting, to reduce energy use.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   13", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
