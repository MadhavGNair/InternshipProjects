{"page_content": "Renewable electricity \nOur retail stores, data centers, and offices \naround the world currently source 100 percent \nrenewable electricity. We\u2019ve focused our \nefforts to source renewables around several \nkey pillars: creating new renewable energy \nprojects, undertaking projects that deliver clear \nbenefits to local communities, and supporting \nrenewable energy innovations. About 1.5 \ngigawatts of Apple-created renewable \nelectricity projects account for over 90 percent \nof the renewable electricity our facilities use.\nWe continue to experience tremendous \nprogress toward our goal of transitioning our \nmanufacturing supply chain to 100 percent \nrenewable electricity by 2030. As of March \n2022, 213 manufacturing partners in 25 \ncountries have committed to 100 percent \nrenewable energy for Apple production.\nOver 70 percent of companies on Apple\u2019s \nSupplier List \u2014 those suppliers that make \nup 98 percent of Apple\u2019s direct spend for \nmaterials, manufacturing, and assembly of \nour products worldwide \u2014 have committed to \n100 percent renewable electricity. In addition, \nmany other smaller suppliers have also made \nthese commitments.Direct emissions abatement\nTo address the non-electricity emissions \nassociated with our materials and \nmanufacturing processes, we seek \ntechnological solutions through emissions \nabatement or switching to low-carbon fuel \noptions. For example, we partnered with \naluminum companies and the governments \nof Canada and Quebec to help fund research \nand development for ELYSIS, a technology that \neliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom aluminum smelting.\nMany components essential to products like \nours, including integrated circuit chips and \ndisplay panels, currently rely on manufacturing \nprocesses that use fluorinated gases, which \nhave high global warming potential. We\u2019re \npartnering closely with key manufacturers \nto prevent these gases from being \nreleased into the atmosphere by optimizing \nmanufacturing processes and deploying \nabatement technologies.\nTo address emissions from shipping products \nto our customers, we\u2019re shifting whenever \npossible toward less carbon-intensive shipping \nmodes, such as rail and ocean. And we\u2019re \nseeking out technical innovations, including \nalternative fuels and electric vehicles. In fiscal \nyear 2021, Apple avoided 180,000 metric tons \nof CO 2e by shifting the mode of transport and \nreducing product weight through the removal  \nof the power adapter from the box of \niPhone devices. Providing access to clean energy in South Africa \nEven a few years ago, not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricity  \nat home. Many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costs \nand other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach. As we worked with our \npartners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program,  \nwe saw exciting potential in this community. \nOur partner on the ground, DC GO, a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg,  \ngot to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs. \nUltimately, DC GO developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to 3500 \nhomes that previously lacked access. This was possible only because of the way they  \nbuilt relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solution  \nin line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns.\nIn addition, DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales, maintenance,  \nand other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project \n \u2014 and the community\u2019s access to electricity \u2014 would be sustainable over time.  \nThis is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit \ncommunities, our company, and the environment at the same time.
