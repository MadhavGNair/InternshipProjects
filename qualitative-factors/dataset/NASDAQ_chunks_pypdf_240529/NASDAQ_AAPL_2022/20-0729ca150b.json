{"page_content": "Assessment and management\nThe data we collect on chemicals and materials \nforms the foundation for key decisions that \nhave an impact on our product designs, \nmanufacturing processes, and approach to \nrecycling and reuse. This data enables us \nto establish requirements for our suppliers, \nincluding those set out in our Regulated \nSubstances Specification (RSS)  and the \nRestricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin \nContact Materials list . These requirements \nprovide clear guidelines on potentially harmful \nmaterials, including those that are restricted.Our assessment system helps to ensure \nthat only materials that meet our stringent \nrequirements are used in Apple products. At\u00a0our \nEnvironmental Testing Lab, we evaluate the \nsafety of our products and materials through \nchemical analyses. Our chemists test materials \nfor safety and monitor compliance with our \nspecifications. In fiscal year 2021, we performed \ntoxicological assessments on 1000 new materials \nto proactively evaluate and eliminate potentially \nharmful substances from our products. Both the data we gather on chemicals and \nour rigorous assessments allow us to make \ninformed decisions and manage chemicals, \nfor\u00a0the safety of those who use, make, and \nrecycle our products.\nInnovation\nThe work we do in mapping, assessing, and \nmanaging the chemicals within our supply \nchain underpins our innovations. We rely on \ndetailed information on the material properties, \nincluding toxicological data and environmental \nperformance characteristics. We also look \nComprehensive chemical mapping\nUnderstanding chemical  \ningredients  leads to better  \nmaterials for Apple products\nThrough our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) \nprogram, manufacturers share chemical \ningredients used to make materials with Apple.\nWith FMD data, Apple evaluates the chemicals  \nin materials against restrictions.Data helps Apple suppliers  \nmanage chemicals  when  \nmaking Apple products\nInformation on how chemicals are used, how \nthey\u2019re stored, and how employees are protected \nis shared with Apple by suppliers through our \nChemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program.\nCSD data informs and prioritizes supplier \nengagement, helping to ensure rigorous \nchemical management practices and adoption  \nof safer alternatives.Apple customers benefit   \nfrom use of products made  \nwith safer ingredients\nThe FMD and CSD programs help support \ncreation of best-in-class products in a \nresponsible manner for our customers.Mapping chemicals Mapping chemicals \nthroughout product throughout product \ndevelopment leads to  development leads to  \nbetter, better, safer productssafer products\nRead more about our commitment to using \nsafer\u00a0materials to create safer products in  \nour 2022 Environmental Progress Reportat how these materials are used at each \npoint in the product life cycle, from design, to \nmanufacturing, to end-of-life. This allows us to \nseek out and support the development of safer \nchemistries that have an impact on each phase \n\u2014 and contribute to continually improving the \noverall safety of our products and processes.\nSince the late 1990s, we have diligently \nidentified and removed potentially harmful \nchemicals from our products, such as \nbrominated flame retardants, beryllium, \nmercury, and lead. We\u2019re also driving the \nuse of safer process chemicals in our supply \nchain: Since 2018, all our final assembly sites \nhave used only safer alternative cleaners and \ndegreasers. As we work toward minimizing \npotentially harmful chemistries in our products \nand processes, we\u2019re making the transition to \nsafer alternatives accessible to others through \nindustry initiatives, partnerships, and standards \nwith the hope of driving chemical safety across \nthe industry.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   21", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
