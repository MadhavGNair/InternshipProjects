As \njust one recent example, we\u2019ve continued \nour public support for LGBTQ+ equality by \nworking with The Human Rights Campaign \nand other organizations to support LGBTQ+ \nequality protections and oppose discriminatory \nproposals. This includes legislative advocacy \nat the federal and state levels, and working \nwith coalitions of businesses to stand against \nwhat we believe to be harmful and divisive \nlegislation that threatens individuals, families, \nand communities. Most recently, that included \nsending a letter to Texas leadership opposing \nlaws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. Read more  here . Protecting our customers\nIn the U.S., the legal system is one avenue \nthrough which Apple can take action to support \nour values. For example, in January 2022, \nApple, along with other leading companies, \nfiled an amicus brief  in support of the EPA\u2019s \nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \nbecause that authority \u201cis critical to combatting \nclimate change.\u201d\nIn November 2021, Apple filed a lawsuit against \nNSO Group and its parent company to hold it \naccountable for the surveillance and targeting \nof Apple users. The complaint provides new \ninformation on how NSO Group infected victims\u2019 \ndevices with its Pegasus spyware. To prevent \nfurther abuse and harm to its users, Apple is \nseeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO \nGroup from using any Apple software, services, \nor devices. \nApple\u2019s Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, Lisa Jackson, alongside President Joe Biden \nand other leaders from around the world at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

And at \nthe 26th UN Climate Change Conference of \nthe Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, \nin 2021, Apple called for bold government \naction on climate change, joining several new \ninitiatives, including the First Movers Coalition, \nthe Forest Investor Club, and the Clean Energy \nDemand Initiative.\nWe also advocate for country-specific measures \nthat motivate climate action. For example, \nwe\u2019ve called for enhanced climate ambition \nand renewable energy deployment in Japan\u2019s \nBasic Energy Plan and Nationally Determined \nContribution (Japan\u2019s plan to reduce emissions \nin furtherance of the Paris Agreement), and for Advocating for changeApple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   9\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
