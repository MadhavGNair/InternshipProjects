{"page_content": "Education\nAccess to education is a human right, and \nwe work hard to ensure that our resources \nare used to uplift communities around the \nworld, creating opportunities for educators \nand students to gain coding skills and unlock \ncreativity. Our efforts also support the UN \nSustainable Development Goals, including goal \n4 on access to education, goal 8 on decent \njobs, and goal 10 on reducing inequality (see \nAppendix page  75).\nCommunity Education Initiative\nInspired by the impact of our ConnectED \ninitiative  and programs like Everyone \nCan Create and Everyone Can Code, we \nlaunched our Community Education Initiative \n(CEI) in 2019 with a focus on expanding \nlearning opportunities in communities \nthat are historically underrepresented and \nunderresourced in technology. \nCEI partners with K\u201312 and higher education \ninstitutions, community-based organizations, \nand nonprofits to bring coding, creativity, \nand workforce development opportunities to \neducators and learners of all ages. CEI aims to \nbuild knowledge and skills for high-demand, \nhigh-growth technical careers alongside \ncommunities that have been traditionally \nunderresourced to advance education equity. \nOur support includes hardware grants, \nmonetary grants to support scholarships and \nprogramming, resources for educator training, \ncurriculum development, and employee \nengagement opportunities.Through educational partnerships across \nthe U.S., we\u2019ve been able to reach tens \nof thousands of students and educators \nwho might not have had access to our \ntechnology and education resources. As of \nApril 2022, we\u2019ve supported and partnered \nwith 147 education institutions and nonprofit \norganizations \u2014 including 47 HBCUs \u2014 in over \n500 different locations across 36 states in the \nU.S. and four locations across the UK since the \ninitiative launched in 2019.\nGrounded in the positive relationships that \nwe\u2019ve established with these organizations, \nwe\u2019re working to deepen our impact in \nthree areas:\nEducator development:  We\u2019re providing \neducator development and training \nopportunities to build the knowledge and \nskills that educators need to teach coding \nin underrepresented communities through \nTeacher Coding Academies and the CEI \nLearning Series. These programs allow \nhundreds of teachers from around the U.S. \nto meet virtually and in person to share \nbest practices for integrating and teaching \ncoding and creativity concepts. Through \nour Academies and CEI Learning Series, \nwe\u2019re connecting CEI educators with Apple \nDistinguished Educators from all around the \nworld. Apple Distinguished Educators lead and \nparticipate in learning workshops, along with \nour Apple Professional Learning Specialists.\nOut-of-school-time learning:  We\u2019re \npartnering with nonprofits, NGOs, and \ncommunity-based organizations that provide \nout-of-school-time learning experiences \nto increase exposure, awareness, and \nexperiences through coding and creativity. \n A new collaboration between Apple and Boys & Girls Clubs of America will bring coding \nwith Swift to tens of thousands of young learners across the country. \nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   62", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 61, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
