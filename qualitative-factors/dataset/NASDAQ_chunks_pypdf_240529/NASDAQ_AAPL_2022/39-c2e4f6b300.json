{"page_content": "Partnerships that accelerate progress\nWe are collaborating with industry associations, \ncivil society organizations, and multi-\nstakeholder initiatives around the world to \npromote best practices, to listen to and learn \nfrom others\u2019 perspectives and experiences, and \nto scale innovative solutions, helping everyone \nto achieve progress at a more rapid pace. See \npage 32 of the People and Environment in Our \nSupply Chain Report  for more detail on the \norganizations we work with.Labor and human rights  \nin the supply chain \nPeople come first in everything we do. Our \ncommitment to protecting the people in our \nsupply chain has been unwavering, anchored \nby a simple set of beliefs: People deserve to be \ntreated with dignity and to know their rights. \nThey should be able to speak up if those rights \nare not being respected \u2014 and to know and \nexpect that when they do, we will listen and act. \nWe\u2019re committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain.We are committed to respecting the rights of \nevery individual in our supply chain \u2014 just like \nwe do for our team members, customers, and \nother partners \u2014 and more broadly, to working \nwith others to share our tools and the lessons \nwe\u2019ve learned, and to empowering everyone to \nachieve progress more rapidly.\nListening to workers\nEffective grievance channels, ongoing worker \nmanagement communications, and supplier \nemployee feedback are essential to ensuring \nrespect for worker rights and maintaining \nsafe and healthy workplaces. Whether \nthrough social dialogue and formal employee \nrepresentation, workplace satisfaction \nsurveys, anonymous hotlines, focus groups, \nor interviews during annual assessments, the \nfeedback we receive directly from supplier \nemployees helps us ensure labor and human \nrights are respected throughout our global \nsupply chain. We also use this feedback \nto address emerging risks, improve rights \ntraining for supplier employees and supplier \nmanagement, and to continually strengthen our \nCode and Standards.\n\u2022 Rights awareness:  We believe that \nprotection starts with rights awareness, \nand since 2008, more than 23.6 million \nsupplier employees have been trained on \ntheir workplace rights. Under our Code and \nStandards, suppliers are required to provide \nemployees with training on their workplace \nrights. This training is generally conducted \nduring new employee orientation, and \ncovers international labor standards, local \nlabor laws, environmental health and safety, \nand the protections required by our Code \nand Standards\u2022 Feedback channels: Supplier employee \ninterviews are an important part of every \nassessment conducted. Each year, we \ninterview tens of thousands of supplier \nemployees in their local language and \nwithout their managers present, to determine \nwhether or not their experience on the job \naligns with auditors\u2019 observations during \nassessments. In fiscal year 2021, despite \nthe ongoing challenges presented by \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we interviewed \n87,626 workers in our supply chain \u2014 over \n35,000 more than were interviewed in the \nprevious fiscal year. \n Our Code and Standards require effective \nworker feedback channels, including \ngrievance mechanisms, at all supplier sites. \nWe also provide third-party anonymous \nhotlines, which are also available to our \nemployees (see page 72 ), and the ability to \ncontact the Apple Environment and Supply \nChain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at any \ntime and in any language. When an issue is \nraised, we require supplier management to \nimmediately investigate and to resolve the \nissue in a timely manner.\n In 2021, we launched a grievance hotline \nawareness campaign, and its initial rollout \nresulted in a 22 percent increase in utilization \nof these third-party hotlines. The reports \nwe received from supplier employees via \nhotlines in 2021 included issues related to \nwages and benefits, employee relations, \namenities at supplier facilities, workforce \nstability, and health and safety. In each case, \nwe investigated and worked directly with the \nsuppliers to drive improvement and correct \nany compliance issues found.
