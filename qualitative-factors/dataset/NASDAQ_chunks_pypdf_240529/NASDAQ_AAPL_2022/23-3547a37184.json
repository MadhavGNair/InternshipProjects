And we\u2019re committed \nto\u00a0far\u00a0more.\nWe\u2019re making progress in increasing \nrepresentation, and currently 50 percent of \nour workforce in the U.S. is made up of people \nfrom underrepresented communities. With \nmore than 165,000 employees globally, even \na 1 percent improvement impacts a substantial \nnumber of people, and increasing overall \nrepresentation requires focus to drive progress.\nPlease see the Appendix on page 81 for \nmore data on representation across our \nworkforce. Additionally, more than half of our \nBoard identify as women and/or members \nof Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQ+, \nand veterans communities.

And \nwe continue to make progress toward our goal \nof having more diverse interview panels and \ncandidates so that diversity is reflected at every \nstage of the hiring\u00a0process. We\u2019re making sure \neveryone involved in the hiring process has \naccess to the information and resources they need to develop inclusive interviewing\u00a0skills. \nAll of our hiring managers and recruiters \nreceive training in inclusive hiring practices. \nOur recruiters also receive training on how to \ncontinuously drive meaningful conversations \nwith hiring managers to help implement these \nhiring practices with every role. These trainings \nhelp mitigate inherent biases and create more \nconsistent hiring experiences for\u00a0all.\nWe\u2019re working to accelerate progress through \nour diversity recruiting and hiring efforts across \nApple, with a focus on technical, engineering, \nand leadership\u00a0roles.
