{"page_content": "Responsible  \nmaterials sourcing\nFrom mapping our supply chain and assessing \nrisk, to conducting independent, third-party \naudits, engaging with civil society and industry, \nand investing heavily in innovation, upholding \nstandards in the sourcing of materials is \na responsibility that requires a strategic, \ncomprehensive approach.\nAs we make progress toward our goal to use \nonly recycled and renewable minerals and \nmaterials in our products and packaging, \nwe continue to source primary materials \u2014 \nincluding tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold \n(3TG), and other minerals, such as cobalt \n\u2014 responsibly, while working to improve \nconditions in and around mining communities.Our Responsible Sourcing of Materials \nStandard, part of our Code and Standards, \ncovers all primary and recycled materials, \nincluding advanced and bio-based materials. \nOur standard aligns with leading international \nstandards, including the United Nations Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights and \nthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development\u2019s Due Diligence Guidance \nfor Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from \nConflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD \nDue Diligence Guidance). \nEvery year, as part of our commitment to \ntransparency, we publish a list of identified 3TG, \ncobalt, and \u2014 for the second year \u2014 lithium \nsmelters and refiners in our supply chain. \n100% \nof identified 3TG, cobalt and lithium \nsmelters and refiners participated in \nindependent, third-party audits\nA placer miner holds gold sourced from Alaska and the Yukon as part of the Salmon Gold Project. \nLearn more on page 70 of People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report .\nRead more on page 69 of our People and \nEnvironment in Our Supply Chain Report   \nand in our Conflict Minerals ReportThe first battery with  \n100% responsibly  \nsourced key minerals\nWe also achieved an industry first \n\u2014 a battery containing 100 percent \nresponsibly sourced key minerals, \nwhether primary or recycled. In 2021, \nall identified cobalt and lithium refiners \n\u2014 key materials used to make batteries \nfor all Apple products \u2014 participated in \nOECD-aligned independent, third-party \naudits covering labor, human rights, \nand environmental policies, as well as \nmanagement systems. We continue to \nconduct additional due diligence and \ncarry out OECD-aligned independent, \nthird-party audits on other battery \nmaterials such as graphite, nickel,  \nand copper.We also map other minerals in our products \nsuch as mica, copper, graphite, and nickel, \nand assess new materials for compliance with \nour requirements prior to production. In fiscal \nyear 2021, we conducted due diligence on 26 \nrecycled or bio-based materials to verify that \ntheir sourcing pathways met Apple\u2019s standards \nand expectations.\nAlso in fiscal year 2021, 100 percent of the \nidentified 3TG, cobalt, and lithium smelters and \nrefiners in our supply chain have participated in \nindependent, third-party audits to assess and \nidentify a broad range of risks, including social, \nenvironmental, human rights, and governance \nrisks. This marks seven consecutive years \nof 100 percent compliance for 3TG, six \nconsecutive years for cobalt, and two \nconsecutive years for lithium.In the event that a smelter or refiner is unable \nor unwilling to meet our requirements, we \nremove them from our supply chain. Since \n2009, we have directed the removal of 163 3TG \nand 7 cobalt smelters and refiners from our \nsupply chain.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   44", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 43, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
