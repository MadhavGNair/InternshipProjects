{"page_content": "Support for minority-serving institutions:  \nWe\u2019re especially focused on expanding our \nengagement with minority-serving institutions, \nincluding HBCUs, HSIs, and TCUs, as well as \ncommunity colleges and public schools in \nunderserved communities.\nIn 2021, many of our CEI projects were \nundertaken in support of REJI\u2019s education \nfocus ( page 60 ). For example, in December \n2021, Apple and Boys & Girls Clubs of America \nlaunched a new collaboration to bring coding \nwith Swift to tens of thousands of students \nacross the U.S., building on Apple\u2019s existing \npartnership with the organization to use \niPad and Apple\u2019s free Everyone Can Code \ncurriculum. And in Canada, we\u2019ve supported \nlearning for Indigenous people through an app-\nbased literacy assessment tool, which drove \nsignificant literacy outcomes, encouraged a \ncommunity-based approach, and provided \nlearning activities for children to build oral skills. \nIn addition, we partnered with the Assembly \nof First Nations on an interactive collection of \nApple Books that explore Canadian history \n from an Indigenous perspective.\nApple Developer Academy\nAs the iOS app economy continues to grow, \nwe\u2019re investing in educational programs and \nopportunities that prepare learners of all ages \nand backgrounds for the jobs of the future.\nIn 2013, we started the Apple Developer \nAcademy to empower entrepreneurs, creators, \nand coders by helping them cultivate the skills \nnecessary to pursue new career opportunities. \nThe program focuses on communities with \nhigh youth unemployment and is open to \nanyone, regardless of academic background \nor experience. We seek to spark interest among the next generation of developers and \nbring diverse representation to the growing \napp ecosystem, particularly among women \nand individuals from underrepresented \ncommunities. A larger and more diverse \ndeveloper community helps create more new \nideas and businesses, and it gives more people \naccess to employment and opportunities for \neconomic mobility. Some participants are also \nundertaking practical projects in collaboration \nwith NGOs to help use technology to solve \nchallenges related to their missions, which \namplifies impact even further.\nWe offer two distinct training programs as part \nof the Apple Developer Academy: 1) 30-day \nfoundations courses that cover specific topic \nareas, including an introductory course for \nthose considering app development as a career \npath, and 2) a more intensive academy program \nof at least 10 to 12 months that dives deeper \ninto coding and professional skills. In addition \nto partnering with institutions, the academy \nworks closely with employers to provide direct \npathways to career opportunities. Participants \nalso have access to a strong alumni network  \nas they move forward in their careers.\nAs of April 2022, we have 23 foundation \nprograms and 17 academy programs across \nthe globe working in close collaborations with \ninstitutions that provide content and experience \nopportunities. The programs are based in seven \ncountries with over 2600 participants in total  \nin calendar year 2021 \u2014 and more than  \n15,000 since the inception of the Apple \nDeveloper Academy in 2013.22 On average, job-seeking graduating students \nreceive three job offers, and 92 percent of \nalumni are employed.23 We also see high  \nrates of students staying in the industry. For \nexample, 62 percent of students are still \nworking in iOS coding and design positions \nseven years after graduating from the Brazil \nprogram, and 79 percent of Indonesian alumni  \nare still involved in app development on  \nApple platforms.24 We\u2019re also making progress on our commitment \nto support underrepresented groups. In 2021, \n40 percent of academy students were female, \na 63 percent year-on-year increase, and \n39 percent came from non-STEM backgrounds, \na 56 percent year-on-year increase. In the \nfoundation programs, 34 percent of students \nwere female in 2021.\nAristide Lauga (left), from France, is a new student at the Apple Developer Academy who looks forward to \npursuing his newfound passion for coding.
