{"page_content": "ergonomics trainings and self-assessment \nsupport are aimed at creating an awareness \nof ergonomic risk factors for WMSDs, how to \nprevent them, and how to proactively request \nfor adjustments to workstations. \nWe completed over 10,000 individual support \nrequests for our team members working from \nhome, along with those who returned to Apple \noffices and Apple Store locations. Support \nincluded tailored guidance and feedback, \nequipment recommendations, and 1:1 virtual \nor in-person assessments. In addition, over \n3000 employees participated in various \ntraining sessions. \nOur industrial, warehouse, and other non-\noffice operations teams were supported with \napproximately 400 ergonomic risk assessments \nand 76 lab screenings. The assessments \nevaluated risk factors such as repetition, \nforce, posture, and duration, while reviewing \nthe interaction of the team member with \nnew machines, equipment, work processes, \nand workspaces.\nEmergency preparedness and response \nBeyond COVID-19, we supported the response \nto dozens of crisis events in 2021, including \nfires, severe weather, and civil unrest. Our \nresponses focused on the safety of our \nemployees and business continuity. We \nactivated 31 crisis management teams (CMTs) \nto manage the most severe events, and 120 \nadditional incidents were supported without \nfull CMTs.All team members can sign up for Apple\u2019s \nEmergency Alert system, enabling them to be \nnotified of local emergencies and to indicate \nwhether they are safe or need help. Disaster \nsupplies are available at our facilities. All Apple \ncampuses with over 1000 employees have \nFacility Response and Recovery Plans, which \nprovide a comprehensive approach to the safety \nand support of our employees while minimizing \nbusiness interruption. Site-specific Emergency \nResponse Plans have been implemented \nglobally. These plans are communicated to all \nemployees, and trainings and drills are held at \nleast annually. And our employees are trained \nin emergency response, allowing them to react \nquickly while supporting the safety of our team \nmembers and customers. \nIn 2021, we completed over 200 emergency \nresponse drills, which were supported by \n2700 trained Emergency Response Team \n(ERT) members. We expect to increase the \nfrequency of these drills, depending on \nCOVID-19 restrictions. \nWith the care and support of our employees \nand customers in mind, we deployed Automatic \nExternal Defibrillator (AED) stations across \nour global retail stores in 2021. And to ensure \nthat our team members could effectively use \nthis new tool, we provided AED training for our \nteam members.\nAll campuses and key sites have disaster supplies \nto match localized risks. As Apple\u2019s footprint \ngrows, sites are evaluated and supplies are \nadded as needed. As one example, in 2021, we \nlaunched earthquake preparedness campaigns \nfor employees across the western United States \nand Japan. We conducted outreach to provide \nemployees with information, tools, and resources, \nand we held drills in some offices.\nWe\u2019re always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when \nthey\u2019re conducting business for Apple. \nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   34", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
