{"page_content": "Apple\u2019s Safety Compliance Policy defines \nprocedures to monitor products in the field and \ninvestigate potential safety issues. This policy \nrequires escalation of safety issues to Apple \nmanagement and timely reporting to regulators \nwhere necessary. It also requires mechanisms \nfor employees to confidentially report safety \nor compliance concerns, as well as training for \nemployees on how to address the concerns. \nOur Product Integrity and Legal teams are \nresponsible for ensuring that Apple\u2019s Safety \nCompliance Policy is followed.We collect devices for refurbishing and reuse \nthrough several programs, including Apple \nTrade In, the iPhone Upgrade Program, \nAppleCare, and our corporate Hardware \nReuse Program. In fiscal year 2021, we sent \n12.2 million devices and accessories to new \nowners for reuse. Our Trade In program extends \nto 25 countries, providing customers with \noptions for product end-of-life \u2014 to access \nthe value of their current device if they want to \nupgrade to a newer model, or to recycle their \ndevices for free.\nProduct safety\nWe design our products to make sure they\u2019re \nsafe for anyone who assembles, uses, or \nrecycles them.\nCommitment to safety \nThe well-being of those who design, make, use, \nand recycle our products is a priority for Apple, \nwhich is why we\u2019re committed to using safer \nmaterials to create safer products. We assess \nthe health and safety of all our products, during \nevery stage of their life cycle \u2014 from early \nconcept development, through use, service, \nand repair, to recycling. During the design and \nprototyping process, cross-functional Apple \nteams analyze potential failures and their \neffects from a quality and safety perspective. \nThe results drive product design improvements \nand manufacturing process controls.\nApple is committed to helping customers \nunderstand how to safely use Apple \nproducts. Apple\u2019s product user manuals  \ninclude important safety and handling \ninformation, and Apple offers additional topical \ncontent to provide tips and help customers \nunderstand features. For example, Apple published articles to make \nsure customers with potential skin sensitivities  \nunderstand what materials are used in \nour wearable products. We also explained \nhow to clean and disinfect  Apple products, \nand provided guidance on keeping Apple \nproducts with magnets a safe distance from \nmedical devices.\nSafety compliance \nApple\u2019s products are designed, tested, and \ncertified to comply with international and \nregional safety standards. They also meet our \nown specifications, which often go above and \nbeyond what is required. For example, Apple\u2019s \nRegulated Substances Specification restricts \nthe use of certain chemical substances in Apple \nproducts, and we apply rigorous additional \ncontrols for materials that may have prolonged \ncontact with the skin. Components that are \ncritical to safety are subject to enhanced \nrequirements and additional supplier audits.\nApple tracks customer reports of potential \nproduct safety issues, and employees \nare trained on how to handle, document, \nand properly escalate such reports. Apple \ninvestigates reported incidents and also \nanalyzes products for potential safety issues.  \nIn the rare event that Apple determines a \nproduct poses a potential safety risk, we take \naction to recall the product, which includes \nnotifying customers and helping customers \nhave their products repaired, replaced, \nor refunded.\nApple products also help customers in emergencies  \nand in caring for their well-being, with features like \nemergency calling, fall detection, medical ID, and \nhearing health notifications. \nKeeping our products current  \nwith software updates\nApple provides free software upgrades to \nimprove our customers\u2019 experience and help \nour products last longer. Our customers can \ncount on the latest software features and \nsecurity updates to their existing devices for \nyears. We continually improve the operating \nsystems that power our products and engineer \neach software release to run seamlessly on all \nsupported devices.\nExtending the life of products and parts \nthrough refurbishment and reuse\nWe can lower the impact each device has on \nthe environment \u2014 including carbon intensity \nper year of life \u2014 by finding ways to refurbish \nand reuse these products. And by building our \nproducts to serve more than one owner and \nencouraging customers to exchange devices \nfor an upgrade, we extend the life  \nof our products.Now available: Self Service Repair\nSelf Service Repair became available in April \n2022, providing repair manuals and genuine \nApple parts and tools through the Apple Self \nService Repair Store . Self Service Repair is \navailable in the U.S. and will expand to additional \ncountries, beginning in Europe, later in 2022. \nThe new online store offers more than 200 \nindividual parts and tools, enabling customers \nwho are experienced with the complexities of \nrepairing electronic devices to complete repairs \non the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups and \niPhone SE (3rd generation).\nWe also released \u201c Expanding Access to Safe, \nReliable, and Secure Service and Repair ,\u201d \nwhich details Apple\u2019s approach to designing \nlong-lasting products and increasing access \nto repairs.\nAppendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   57", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2022.pdf", "page": 56, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
