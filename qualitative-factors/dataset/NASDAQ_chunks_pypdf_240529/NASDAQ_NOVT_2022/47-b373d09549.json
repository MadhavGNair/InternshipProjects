(Novanta ) to provide independent assurance of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \ninventory for the calendar year 2022 (CY22) against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and materiality \nof the professional judgement of the verifier  using LRQA\u2019s verification procedure and ISO 14064 - Part 3 for greenhouse gas \nemissions. LRQA \u2019s verification procedure is based on current best practise and is in accordance with ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410.  \n \nOur assurance engagement covered Novanta\u2019s  global operations and activities under its financial control, and specifically the \nfollowing requirements:  \n\u2022 Verifying c onformance with:  \n\u2022 Novanta\u2019s reporting  methodologies for the selected datasets;  \n\u2022 World Resources Institute / World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A \ncorporate accounting and reporting standard, revised edition (otherwise referred to as the WRI/WBCSD GHG \nProtocol) for the GHG data2. \n\u2022 Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information for only the selected indicators listed below:  \n\u2022 Direct (Scope 1) and Energy Indirect (Scope 2) emissions.  \n \nLRQA\u2019s responsibility is only to Novanta.  LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibil ity to others as explained in the end \nfootnote. Novanta\u2019s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information with in \nthe Inventory and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Inventory is derived.  Ultimately, \nthe Inventory has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of Novanta.  \n \nLRQA\u2019s Opinion  \nBased on LRQA\u2019s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that Novanta has not, in all \nmaterial respects:  \n\u2022 Met the requirements of the criteria listed above; and  \n\u2022 Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and information as summarized in Tables 1 and 2 below.  \nThe opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance3 and at the materiality of the professional \njudgement of the verifier.  \n \nTable 1.

The extent of evidence -gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement.  Limited \nassurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.  Consequently, the level  of assurance \nobtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assuran ce \nengagement been performed.   \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_NOVT_2022.pdf", "page": 47, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
