{"page_content": "ALICO 2021 ESG REPORT    14\nTCFD DISCLOSURES\nAlico uses the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD) framework to align our communications about climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities\u2014and how we\u2019re responding to the \nclimate change imperative. \nGOVERNANCE\nThe Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee of \nthe Board of Directors provides oversight for climate risks and \nopportunities. The committee has ultimate responsibility for \nthe direction of Alico\u2019s climate-related policies, strategies and \nprograms, including the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions \nand the setting of carbon reduction targets. \nAlico\u2019s Sustainability Steering Council, consisting of a cross-\nfunctional team of senior leaders across the company and headed \nby the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the management \nof climate-related risks and opportunities, including the decision in \nFY 2021 to undertake the company\u2019s first carbon footprint and to \nbegin the development of a carbon reduction roadmap aligned with \nscience-based targets.\nTo prepare and respond to these risks, Alico is using the \ninformation gathered during our baseline carbon footprint project \nto estimate the potential cost of carbon regulations, examining \nopportunities to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and constantly \ntesting new varieties of citrus trees to prepare for changing \nclimate conditions. Positioned to quickly act on climate-related \nopportunities, Alico is actively engaged in the evolving voluntary \nagriculture-based carbon credit market.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nWhile we are in the early stages of climate risk management, we \nare guided by external standards like the International Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC) climate risk scenarios, TCFD guidance on \nconducting climate risk assessments and the Network for Greening \nthe Financial System (NGFS) climate scenario data bank. In the \ncoming year, we plan to conduct a more detailed climate risk \nassessment based on these resources, including the integration of \nclimate risks into our existing risk management system.

Using this data, we expect to \ncontinue to calculate our annual carbon footprint so that we can \ngenerate a rolling 5-year average, which is recommended by the \nGHG Protocol Agriculture Guidance for agriculture companies to \n\u201ceven out\u201d variances in temperature, rainfall, and overall weather \npatterns\u2014which in turn affect irrigation requirements, fertilizer \nand pesticide application, and the appropriateness of regenerative \nagriculture practices. This approach allows us to more effectively \nchart our progress and communicate trends over time.In the coming months, we will also be developing carbon intensity \nmetrics that will allow us to understand our emissions in relation to \nproduction and revenue data. This process will enable us to more \neffectively integrate carbon risk into our business strategy and \nrisk management processes. Ultimately, we expect to set science-\nbased targets aligned with the IPCC recommended 1.5 \u00b0C global \nwarming threshold, including a glide path to net-zero emissions by \n2050.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALCO_2021.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
