We interviewed key subject matter experts from around the \ncompany, examined sustainability disclosures from other agriculture \ncompanies and analyzed questionnaires, audits, and inquiries from \ninvestors and customers.\nUsing the SASB Five Factor Test for materiality, we identified \nnine material topics across three workstreams: Environmental \nStewardship, Product Responsibility and Great Place to Work. \nThese nine topics are the most important environmental, social and \ngovernance issues for our business and to our stakeholders. \nIn addition to guiding our internal sustainability strategy, this \nframework also maps to this sustainability report, with chapters  \nfor each of the major workstreams and separate pages for each \nmaterial topic.Environmental \nStewardship\nEnergy and\nClimate\nWater\nSustainable \nAgricultureProduct \nResponsibility\nFood Safety\nSupply Chain\nSustainability\n Data Privacy \nand SecurityGreat Place to Work\nHealth & Safety\nDiversity\nFair LaborSustainability", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALCO_2021.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
