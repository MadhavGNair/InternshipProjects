In the agriculture industry, these contractors \nare often the most vulnerable to labor abuses. To minimize risk to \nworkers and to Alico\u2019s reputation, we are committed to ensuring \nour compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and other \nemployment standards when dealing with FLC service providers. \nOur Third-Party Labor Policy, created in FY 2021, outlines \nour requirements for labor brokers including, but limited to, \nprovisions on minimum legal working age, proper work permits \nand documentation, prohibition on recruitment fees and bonds, \nprohibitions on discrimination and harassment, restrictions on holding worker documents, prohibitions on corruption and \nbribery, and grievance procedures and corrective action processes. \nMost importantly, these provisions must be enforced throughout \nthe entire recruitment process, from initial solicitation to final \nemployment. During the annual contracting process, Alico uses a \nvariety of methods to confirm that each FLC meets our standards for \nethical conduct, including:\n\u2022 Confirming current license and good standing by the United \nStates Department of Labor.\n\u2022 Reviewing supporting documentation directly from the broker \nproper compensation of its employees and compliance with the \nterms of its written job offers.\n\u2022 Receiving a written acknowledgement of the policy from the \ncontractor to abide by this policy document.\nIndicator Unit FY 2021 Data\nT otal turnover Percent (%) 37\nVoluntary Percent (%) 32\nInvoluntary Percent (%) 5EMPLOYEE TURNOVER PERFORMANCE\nPERCENT OF TOTAL TURNOVER BY JOB FUNCTION\nManagement 7%\nExecutives 0%\nPermanent workforce 93%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALCO_2021.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
