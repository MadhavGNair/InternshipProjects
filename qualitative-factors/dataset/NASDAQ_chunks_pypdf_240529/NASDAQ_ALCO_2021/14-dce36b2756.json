What this means in practice is that we must adapt \nour water management practices to deal with different irrigation, \nerosion and nutrient run-off challenges. Algae growth, excess \norganic matter buildup (biosolids) and sedimentation are threats \nthat we carefully navigate with a team of grove managers with \nunparalleled experience.  \nT otal water withdrawn includes groundwater and rainwater, which both falls directly on the groves and is captured in lagoons and used \nas tailwater for additional irrigation where needed. All water withdrawn is applied to the land and so is considered consumed. Using WRI\u2019s \nAqueduct tool, we have determined that 48% of our groves are in areas of high baseline water stress.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALCO_2021.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
