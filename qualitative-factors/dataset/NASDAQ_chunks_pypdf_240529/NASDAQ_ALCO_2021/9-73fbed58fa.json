Farmers \nand ranchers, as well as hunters and anglers, are the original \nenvironmentalists. Farmers and ranchers have the greatest financial \nincentive to be the best stewards of the land to preserve their livelihoods \nand those of future generations\u2026 Farmers and ranchers who manage \ntheir land with those other benefits in mind often are also the most \nprofitable farmers. \n \n \u2014Adam Putnam\n    Interview with Leading Harvest", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALCO_2021.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
