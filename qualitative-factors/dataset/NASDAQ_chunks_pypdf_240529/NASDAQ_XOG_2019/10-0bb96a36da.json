{"page_content": "The company has leveraged its expansive \n3D seismic, unmatched vertical well control \nand petrophysical modeling to better plan \nwellbores and avoid cost overruns, such  \nas sidetracks. \nIn 2019, Extraction drilled five two-mile \nwells, spud to spud, in less than four days. \nExtraction\u2019s average for two-mile wells is \nfive days.Over the last 18 months of drilling, \nExtraction only experienced two sidetracks.\nABOVE & BEYOND // 11A CULTURE  \nOF INNOVATION\nExtraction Oil & Gas is known for the \ninnovations we have pioneered in Colorado, \nincluding multiple layers of operational \nsafety protection and engineering designs \nthat safeguard people and the environment. \nOur development and use of advanced \ntechnologies in our operational practices  \nare driven by an industry-leading technical \nteam with decades of combined experience  \nin well planning, drilling, completions and  \noperational safety.\nEfficient, safe and environmentally \nfriendly drilling operations \nThrough intelligent designs and in coordination \nwith its removal of older, legacy vertical \nfacilities, Extraction has achieved a balance of \nbusiness growth with responsible stewardship \nof our precious natural resources. Achieving \nthis balance has allowed the company to \nachieve strong growth in our production \ncapacity and generate a profit while safely \nprotecting the environment of Colorado.\nDrilling: Extraction pioneered the use of an \nelectric-powered drilling rig in Colorado, which \ngreatly increases efficiency and reduces noise \nand exhaust associated with traditional rigs \npowered by diesel fueled generators at  \ncertain sites. \nThe commitment to efficient operations, \ncombined with the knowledge and experience \nof our team, has led to a number of \nimpressive results in 2019: \u2022 To date, Extraction has  \ndrilled more than 60 2.5-mile  \nwells and most recently drilled  \nits first three-mile lateral in  \nsummer of 2019.\n\u2022 In 2018, Extraction\u2019s Patterson 901  \nrig drilled more than one million feet of \nwellbore, setting a record for the nation. \n\u2022  Extraction fundamentally changed the  \nway wells are constructed in the DJ by \ntransitioning from a 7-inch by 4.5-inch \ncasing design to 5.5-inch monobore.  \nThe casing design has multiple \nadvantages, including expediting drill \ntimes and allowing for completion \noptimization. \nDrilling innovations like these are important \nin supporting the long-term relationships we \nhave built with communities along the Front \nRange. The faster a well is drilled, the less \nimpact there is on the environment and the \ncommunities where we operate.\nTankless Facility Designs:  Extraction\u2019s \nBroomfield Development Plan is built  \naround Tankless Facilities that are a step-\nchange for the oil and gas industry\u2014 \nmulti-well production pads that have  \nnear-zero emissions:\n\u2022 Because of our air-tight, closed-loop \nsystem that captures 99.9 percent of \nair emissions, Extraction\u2019s facilities ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XOG_2019.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
