The \ninventory follows the GHG Protocol Corporate \nStandard, one of the most widely used GHG \naccounting standards for businesses, and serves \nas a key tool for us to measure, develop, imple-\nment and track energy efficiency and emissions \nreduction activities. In addition, we have expanded \nthe scope of our inventory to account for emis-\nsions associated with segments of our value chain \nactivities (Scope 3). We have outlined the relevant \nsources for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions for our \nglobal direct operations in addition to several \nScope 3 categories. \nWe would like to note that our emissions account-\ning methodology, specifically our approach to esti-\nmating square footage and emissions for facilities \nthat do not have data, has changed this reporting \nyear. Rather than applying 2,500 square feet to \nall facilities that have unknown areas, the average \nsquare footage per facility type was applied.
