Through the distribution program, VSE is contributing to greater sustainability by helping keep engines and accessories in use longer and \nmitigating against unnecessary waste.\n11\nVSE works with Southwest Airlines\u00ae to support its retirement of the Boeing 737NG  platform and to pro -\nvide end-of-life asset management services. VSE works with vendors to remove an average of 1,000 parts \nfrom each aircraft, restore parts to their original state and functionality, and redeploys those parts in \nthe market for reuse. Around 3,600 pounds of metal from each aircraft is recycled. This teardown/parts \nre-sale process re-purposes approximately 90% of the aircraft.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VSEC_2022.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
