The employees decided to take action, donating funds and supplies to two Chinese primary schools over the past two years. \n\u201cIn China, many children are losing their primary education opportuni-\nties due to low family income,\u201d said Kemn Song, RF technical manager. \u201cWe often hear these types of stories on the radio and TV and we feel a responsibility to do as much as we can to help students, especially since education is crucial to one\u2019s entire life. We had an internal discussion about this issue at our office, which was the origin of this charity effort.\u201d\nThe self-funded charity effort began last year when Shenzhen employees, with \nthe help of a charity organization, identified the Maka Primary School in the Sichuan Province. Employees decided to donate RMB6350 to fund two orphans at the Maka Primary School who were in danger of losing their education opportunities without external support. In addition, although the Maka Primary School is more than 1,000 kilometers (approximately 621 miles) away from ADI\u2019s Shenzhen office, a group of employees nevertheless visited the school to meet the teachers and students and bring donations of stationery and dictionaries. This year, employees decided they would like to support a primary school that was closer to the Shenzhen office, which would allow for greater interaction between employees and the students they were aiding. \nAfter consulting with a local charity organization, employees in the \nShenzhen office decided to support the Chengxi Primary School, which is located 350 kilometers (approximately 217 miles) from Shenzhen in the Guangdong Province and has 12 teachers and 150 students in grades one through six. The principal of the Chengxi Primary School told employees in ADI\u2019s Shenzhen office that the local government has little money to invest in the school. The employees visited the Chengxi Primary School over a weekend, meeting students and teachers, talking to them about ADI and the company\u2019s mission, and bringing donations of school supplies and sports equipment to the school. In addition, employees decided to again aid two disadvantaged students by funding their tuition, resident fees, books, and other expenses for one year. Furthermore, employees are building a long-term relationship with students and teachers at the Chengxi Primary School through regular communication.\n\u201cAlmost every employee in the Shenzhen office participated in the charitable effort for the Chengxi Primary School in some way,\u201d said Flora Man, sales director, China RSG. \u201cSome employees wrote the cards, some donated books, and almost half the employees in our office donated money to aid the Chengxi Primary School, which totaled RMB3050. Our main aim is to stimulate kids\u2019 impetus to gain knowledge, expand their horizon, and set higher life goals for themselves. We feel good about our efforts and plan to keep this charitable work going in the future.\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2013.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
