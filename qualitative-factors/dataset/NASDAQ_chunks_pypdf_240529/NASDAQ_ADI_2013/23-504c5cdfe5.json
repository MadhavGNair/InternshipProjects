We maintain a network of \nthousands of sales professionals, comprised of ADI employees, sales representatives, and distributors. Our largest customers are covered directly by our sales engineers and field applications engineers (FAEs). The entire organization receives training several times a year to stay current with the latest new products and market trends. Our sales team is often rated as the most knowledgeable in the industry. \nIn order to strengthen the company\u2019s focus on delivering world-class signal \nprocessing products and support to customers, we are primarily organized by market segment and technology areas. Business teams focus on devel-oping insight into strategic markets including, automotive, communications, industrial, and consumer. Healthcare is included in industrial. Product and technology teams advance ADI\u2019s technical innovation, primarily by focusing in areas of high speed signal processing, precision signal processing, power, sensors, and digital signal processors. A worldwide sales team is the primary interface to customers. \nThis structure aligns with what is most relevant to ADI\u2019s long-term strategic \npriorities\u2014technology to enable the continuous product innovation that defines ADI and applications insight to enable the system-level innovation that helps customers to win.\nADI manages a strategic planning process around both the product \nand market dimensions. As such, ADI is able to gain clear alignment of strategies across the organization in order to leverage the full breadth of ADI\u2019s offerings\u2014both core products and application-specific products\u2014across our customer base. ADI is also able to improve the strategic clarity around investment priorities, ensuring we focus our valuable R&D dollars on the most promising opportunities where we can achieve and sustain growth and profits.\nTransportation\nADI has adopted a strategy of storing most finished product in warehouse \noperations that are either adjacent to, or in regional proximity to the facilities where the parts finish the manufacturing process, allowing us to ship from these operations directly to our customers and distributors. This eliminates extra transportation journeys that would be associated with having regional inventory holding points. Exceptions to this occur only when service level requirements necessitate local stocking. In addition, we actively pursue efficiencies by consolidating all customer shipments to a given region to the extent possible. For the transportation managed by ADI, the company partners with a limited and select number of transportation service providers. We rely on these companies making the investments required to develop sustainability best practices, and we believe that they have active, robust programs in place. \nPackaging\nProperly packaging our products to adequately protect them against \ndamage during transit is critical. While safeguarding our product is key, we strive to achieve this without adding unnecessary extra packaging, or fill content. Packaging procedures are reviewed as appropriate with this in mind. It is our aim wherever possible to use materials that can be fully recycled by the recipient. Packing and shipping operations are also reviewed to reduce paper generation, printing only those forms that are essential to the process. For inbound shipments, ADI utilizes approved partners for recycling of packaging materials.\nReporting\nGlobal Reporting Initiative\nWe considered the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting \nGuidelines (G3.1) when preparing this report.
