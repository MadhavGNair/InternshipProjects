Effective battery monitoring has become a priority as car manufacturers strive to provide efficient engine management features that reduce fuel consumption, such as automatic start/stop, and as car batteries provide power for more and more essential functions in automotive systems. \nADI Is Enabling Innovation in Automobile Safety \nADI\u2019s MEMS accelerometers measure deceleration in automobile safety systems. This measurement helps determine whether to fire the airbags in a crash situation. Last year, through the modules created by our direct customers, ADI estimates our MEMS safety products were involved in saving nearly 3,000 lives. Every day we helped someone return home safely to their families.\n   Accident free driving is the goal we are working toward and our strategy is built on three      \n        pillars\u2014Predict. Prevent. And Protect. MEMS technology, as well as ADI\u2019s RF, microwave,  \n              and converter technology will be critical to realizing this goal. \nEH&S Stewardship\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2013.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
