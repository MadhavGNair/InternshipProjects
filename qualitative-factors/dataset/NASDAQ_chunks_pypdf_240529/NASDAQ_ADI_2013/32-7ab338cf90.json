Based in Manchester, NH, the 501(c)(3)  \nnot-for-profit public charity designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.\nADI Employee Mentors Students in Robotics Competition\nEvery year, hundreds of thousands of students compete in FIRST \ncompetitions. The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) offers high school students the opportunity to work directly with professional engineers to gain hands-on experience by building and programming a task-oriented robot. FIRST Robotics teams can progress from local competitions to the championship round held in St. Louis, Missouri. ADI and its employees support FIRST teams as volunteer mentors, judges, and fundraisers at FIRST events throughout North America. As one of our community partnerships FIRST aligns with our goals of supporting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) programs in the communities where we work and live. In addition, Analog Devices is a proud supporter of FIRST as a gold supplier sponsor. We supply MEMS (micro electromechan-ical systems) and controllers for the kit of parts, which are used by teams throughout the world. \nAnalog Devices has been involved with FIRST for the past 11 years, and we continue to expand our involvement with both financial support and encouraging our talented workforce to participate as volunteers. The teams we support have won several awards and have gone on to compete in the St. Louis championship rounds. ADI is proud to be partnering with FIRST in their mission to encourage young people to pursue educational opportunities in engineering and math.\nADI University Program\nAnalog Devices\u2019 Engineering University Program provides engineering students and professors with an affordable portable analog design kit that will enhance engineering students\u2019 educational experience by allowing them to experiment quickly and easily with advanced technologies and build and test real-world, functional analog design circuits anytime and anywhere. This \u201chands-on learning\u201d design approach gives students and professors the freedom and creativity to expand the scope of course materials and explore real-time design scenarios right in the classroom. Easy access to online and downloadable software and teaching materials, online support, textbook, reference designs, and lab projects to design and implement analog circuits as a supplement to their core engineering curriculum is also provided. \nAnalog Devices supports colleges and universities around the world  \nwith grants for engineering research.\nDuring the 2012\u20132013 school year we committed over $2M to engineering \nstudents, faculty and research programs. In addition we also donate substantial amounts of our products and development tools.
