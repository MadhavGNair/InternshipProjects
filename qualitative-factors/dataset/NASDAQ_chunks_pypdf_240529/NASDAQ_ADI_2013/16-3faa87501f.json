Analog Devices\u2019 signal pro-cessing technology for motor and power control was on display at PCIM to demonstrate how ADI\u2019s technology is addressing these design challenges. \nWith nearly 8,000 attendees, PCIM is Europe\u2019s leading exhibition for power \nelectronics and its applications in intelligent motion, renewable energy, and energy management. At PCIM, a Motor and Power \nControl Segment Marketing Manager met with customers on the show floor.\nIn motor control and power control, better precision and accuracy of \nelectronic controls are required to deliver the highest system performance and efficiency of industrial motor drives and servos. ADI helps system engineers address these design challenges with a complete product portfolio including data converters, amplifiers, embedded processors, i Coupler\n\u00ae digital \nisolators, MEMS sensors, and power management devices that support core signal chains. ADI\u2019s technology makes it possible to precisely control the motion of electric motors and enhance communications capabilities.\nADI\u2019s focus is on core signal chains for application-specific motor control, \ndrives, servos and robotics, power supplies, and UPS (uninterruptible power supply). Through ADI\u2019s partner network and a complete product portfolio, model-based motor control solutions are available to ease development and speed design time. ADI has all the hardware, software, and signal processing experience needed to help improve, simplify, and differentiate new motor control system designs.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2013.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
