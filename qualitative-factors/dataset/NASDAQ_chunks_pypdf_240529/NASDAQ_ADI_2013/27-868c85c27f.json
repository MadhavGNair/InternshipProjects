We use similar systems to manage the social and economic aspects of our sustainability program. In the future, we plan to integrate additional elements into our sustainability management system. \nADI was an early adopter of the ISO 14001 environmental management \nsystem standard; its first facility became certified under that standard in May 1997. Today, all of ADI\u2019s major manufacturing sites are ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 (health and safety management system) certified. ADI is in a position to include sustainability into an integrated management system that is already a key part of the way our business is operated. \nDuring the time frame covered by this report, environmental, health,  \nand safety objectives and targets were reviewed and prioritized using  \na risk management process. Action plans were established within the  \nmanagement system and were reviewed with management at each  \nADI manufacturing site. The status of those action plans is reported  \nto senior management on a quarterly basis. In addition, independent  \nauditors reviewed the management system during semiannual audits.  \nThe results of those action plans are covered in this report.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2013.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
