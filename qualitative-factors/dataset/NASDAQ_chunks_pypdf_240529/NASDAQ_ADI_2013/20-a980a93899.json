{"page_content": "Our Responsibilitiesanalog.com/sustainability\n2012\u20132013 Sustainability Report 21\nAs another part of this emerging trend in wearable personal performance and \nmedical products, we have released a new series of photosensor devices that can be built into the back of a watch or other wearable device. These sensors can measure heart rate, oxygen concentration, and other physio-logical parameters without penetrating the skin surface. We also digitize the information to make it easy to transmit over a wireless connection.  \nEnergy harvesting is a new area of development at ADI, and we have \nprojects in multiple aspects of this technology, including energy capture, nanopower energy management, and energy storage. Energy harvesting is particularly useful for powering remote sensors to eliminate all wiring and allow better placement. The ADP5090 boost regulator can efficiently extract power from very small sources and convert it for use or storage while using very little internal power. Analog IC technology has been the foundation of ADI\u2019s business for nearly \nfive decades. The principal advantages of these products have included lower cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption, and fewer components\u2014resulting in improved reliability. These attributes fit common needs for customers seeking to sell more sustainable products. \nOur data converters remain our largest and most diverse product family, \nrepresenting close to 50% of our revenue. We sell over 2,000 different converters to thousands of customers. One of the newest products in this area is the ADuCM350, which we term the \u201cmeter on a chip.\u201d It allows a medical instrument designer to build a glucose meter with only a few parts and with improved performance. The ADuCM350 is also being designed into several personal care consumer/fitness wearable devices.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2013.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
