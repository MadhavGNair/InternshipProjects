The Foundation advances this vision through \na number of hands-on and virtual experiences for \nstudents and teachers. The Foundation is especially \ncommitted to reaching diverse and underserved \npopulations that might not otherwise have access to scientific education and resources. The following \nare highlights of existing and new science education \nprograms for 2018:\n\u2022  The Amgen Foundation became the founding sponsor \nof the new LabXchange online platform, awarding \n$6.5 million to Harvard University to develop, launch \nand grow this platform that increases student  \naccess to online lab-based learning. Amgen \nscientists will play key advisory roles to enhance the \nimpact of the platform with a virtual lab that integrates \ndynamic experimental simulations with background \ncurriculum and social networking.\n\u2022  The Amgen Scholars Program expanded with \na new four-year, $21 million commitment, bringing \nthe program to a total of 24 elite institutions across \nthe United States, Europe, Asia and, for the first \ntime, Australia and Canada.
