{"page_content": "Amgen 2018 Responsibility Highlights Report    22BUSINESS ETHICS ENVIRONMENT REPORTING WORKPLACE ACCESS TO MEDICINE COMMUNITY COMMITMENT\nReducing Carbon Through Energy Conservation\nAmgen implements a comprehensive carbon reduction \nstrategy that encompasses strategic elimination of \nenergy use, increasing energy efficiency and increasing \nthe proportion of energy used from renewable and \nalternative sources. We complete projects and \nincorporate innovations that provide substantial returns \nfor both energy savings and carbon reduction across \nour network of facilities around the world. We have \nrealized savings of $30 million in operating costs \nannually and reduced carbon emissions by 126,000 \nmetric tons (MT), or 30 percent, from 2007 through \n2018, by implementing energy conservation and \ncarbon reduction projects. In addition to operations-based projects, we also take steps to reduce carbon \noutput from our business by encouraging alternative \nmethods of commuting to work, such as carpooling \nand providing electric vehicle charging stations at \nsome facilities. At the end of 2018, we had exceeded \nour 2020 carbon targets for fleet vehicles and facility \noperations. We are continuing to work through our \nportfolio of identified carbon reduction opportunities \nfor 2019 as we finalize our next generation of \nenvironmental targets.\nHighlights of our energy and carbon program in  \n2018 include:\u2022  Expansion of our smart and integrated facility \nmonitoring system to six Amgen sites. This award-\nwinning system has helped our engineers identify \nconservation opportunities that reduced 83,000 \ngigajoules (GJ) of energy, reduced 5,400 MT of  \ncarbon and saved $1.3 million.   \n\u2022  Installation of latest-generation, high-efficiency chillers \nat our site in Ireland are conserving 2,700 GJ of \nenergy per year and reducing 315 MT of carbon. \n\u2022  Optimization of the heating, ventilation and air \nconditioning system at our laboratories in San Francisco \nresulted in annualized savings of 28,600 GJ of energy \nand 1,300 MT of carbon and saved $418,000.\nCarbon Emissions and Carbon Emissions Reduced Through Conservation Efforts (1,000 MT)  2018 Energy Use by Source (1,000 GJ)Natural Gas\nFossil FuelScope 1 Sources\nScope 2 SourcesDiesel\nRenewablesPropane\nNuclear\nNonspecified* Value represents year-over-year,  \ncumulative and continuing avoidance.Carbon Emissions\nCarbon Emissions Avoided* \nFrom 2007 Through 2012\nCarbon Emissions \nAvoided* 2013+ENVIRONMENT\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n014\n201536984430\n937\n17481,01713219\n8\n201336384\n201238584 20\n201684\n29134\n201784\n27842\n201884\n263\n200741610\n201484\n354ENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2018.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
