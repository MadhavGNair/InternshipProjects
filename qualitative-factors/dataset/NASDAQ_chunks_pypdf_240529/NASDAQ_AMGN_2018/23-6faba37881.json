Our staff \nhave identified and implemented innovative, creative \nways to reduce and eliminate waste, including practices \nto increase recycling of plastics used in manufacturing, \nchanging packaging and shipping systems and \nincreasing composting. Total waste generation \ncompany-wide decreased slightly in 2018 compared \nwith 2017. Waste reduction projects implemented in \n2018 resulted in an additional 259 metric tons (MT) of annual waste reduction to achieve a total of 1,297 MT \nsince establishing our 2020 targets. We have reduced \nannual waste generation through projects eliminating \n2,400 MT, or 24 percent, since 2007.\nHighlights of our waste reduction and recycling \nprogram for 2018 include:  \n\u2022  Expansion of our program to recycle plastics  \nused in labs and manufacturing at our Cambridge, \nMassachusetts, research facility. Overall, this \nprogram, in place at three of our sites, diverted 468 \nMT of these plastics from the landfill and repurposed them for industrial uses, including benches in use at \nthese sites. \n\u2022  In 2018, our use of reusable packaging systems \nreduced solid waste by 98 percent compared to \nusing disposable packaging systems associated with \nour clinical shipments. While this does not directly \nimpact Amgen\u2019s waste generation, it does help to \nreduce waste generated at locations where these \nmedicines are shipped.\nRoutine Waste by Waste Hierarchy (MT)Recycled, Composted \nand Reused\nDisposedWaste Reduced* from \n2007 Through 2012Waste Reduced* \nfrom 2013+ENVIRONMENT\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0\n20124,2564,7621,094320\n20134,2874,4931,094688\n20154,8195,2351,094850\n20161,094\n5,517\n4,8141038\n20171,094\n4,790\n5,0671297\n20181,094\n4,625\n5,016\n20076,6043,542441\n20144,5011,094\n4,429\n* Value represents year-over-year,  \ncumulative and continuing avoidance.\nENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2018.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
