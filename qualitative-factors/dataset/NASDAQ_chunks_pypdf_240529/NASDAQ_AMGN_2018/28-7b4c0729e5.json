We provide \ninformation on our website, participate in industry conferences  \nand workshops, provide information to external organizations  \nand produce annual reports. \nIn determining what and how we report externally, Amgen \nconsiders a wide range of international standards and guidelines, \nincluding those developed by the Global Reporting Initiative, \nCDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), Sustainability \nAccounting Standards Board (SASB), the United Nations Global \nCompact and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since \nthere is no single, universally accepted standard for reporting, \nAmgen has aligned the communication in this report with the most global of guidelines: the United Nations Global Compact \nand Sustainable Development Goals. Throughout this report, \nthere are references to the relevant SDGs, and within this section \nthere is a table showing alignment with the Global Compact. \nIn addition to this report, we communicate additional information \nthrough our corporate website:\n\u2022  Donations and grants made by the company and the  \nAmgen Foundation\n\u2022 Political contributions in the U.S.\n\u2022  Disclosures in alignment with the European Federation of \nPharmaceutical Industries and Associations codes of practice\n\u2022  Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014required  \nfinancial reporting\n\u2022 Responses to CDP climate change and water surveys\n\u2022 Environmental dataOur environmental data include annual reporting on our overall \nenergy and carbon, water, waste and sales fleet fuel efficiency \nperformance.
