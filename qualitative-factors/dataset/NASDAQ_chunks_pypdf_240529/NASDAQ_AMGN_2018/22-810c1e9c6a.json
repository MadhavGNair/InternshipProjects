We have developed \nwater-saving practices and strategic projects based \non assessments of our water use and available \nopportunities for conservation. Our total water use \ncompany-wide in 2018 decreased from 2017. Water \nconservation projects implemented in 2018 resulted in \nan additional 12,300 cubic meters (CM) of annual water \nreduction to achieve a total reduction in water use of \n278,000 CM since establishing our 2020 targets.  We have reduced annual water usage through projects \neliminating 964,000 CM, or 29 percent, since 2007. \nAs of the end of 2018, we have exceeded our 2020 \ntarget for water conservation. We are continuing to \nwork through our portfolio of identified water reduction \nopportunities for 2019 as we finalize our next \ngeneration of environmental targets.\n \n Highlights of our water conservation program  \nin 2018 include:\n\u2022  Ongoing use of next-generation biomanufacturing \ntechnologies that reduce the volume of water required \nto maintain manufacturing equipment and spaces\n\u2022  Conservation of approximately 6,000 CM of water per \nyear, resulting from a systems cooling tower upgrade\nWater Intake and Intake Avoided Through Conservation Efforts (1,000 CM)  * Value represents year-over-year,  \ncumulative and continuing avoidance.Water Intake\nWater Intake Avoided* \nFrom 2007 Through 2012\nWater Intake \nAvoided* 2013+3,5004,000\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n0142\n20152,520686\n20122,720686203\n2016686\n2,351266\n2017686\n2,320278\n2018686\n2,093\n20073,28636\n2014686\n2,487ENVIRONMENT\n19\n20132,725686\nENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2018.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
