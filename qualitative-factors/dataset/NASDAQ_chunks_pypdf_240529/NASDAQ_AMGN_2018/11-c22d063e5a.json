Amgen \nmedicines and drug candidates in research address \nnoncommunicable disease, such as cancer, \ncardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, migraines \nand kidney disease with high prevalence in LMICs.\nInvestment in Biosimilars: Amgen is a leader in \ndeveloping and manufacturing biosimilars that will \nenable us to provide more affordable treatment \noptions for patients around the world suffering \nfrom certain types of cancers, inflammatory \nconditions or rare genetic disorders. Three of our \nbiosimilar medicines are listed on the World Health \nOrganization\u2019s Model List of Essential Medicines, demonstrating alignment with well-established \nglobal health needs. Recognizing the importance \nof regulatory systems to review biosimilar products, \nAmgen is working closely with a wide range of \nstakeholders to help middle-income countries \nestablish regulatory frameworks to evaluate \nbiosimilars and enable safe use of these potentially \ncost-saving therapies. \nAccess to Investigational Medicines: We have a \nprocess in place to provide access to therapeutics \nthat are still in clinical trials to patients with serious \ndiseases for which no alternate therapy exists.  \nMore information can be found on www.amgen.com. \nIn 2018, through a corporate donation, Amgen \ncontributed $2 million to the Lazarex Cancer \nFoundation\u2019s IMPACT (IMproving Patient Access  \nto Cancer Clinical Trials) program, which is focused \non improving patient enrollment, retention, minority \nparticipation and equitable access in oncology trials.ACCESS TO MEDICINEACCESS TO MEDICINE \nIn 2018, Amgen donated US $93 million of NEUPOGEN\u00ae \n(filgrastim), Neulasta\u00ae (pegfilgrastim) and Vectibix\u00ae \n(panitumumab) to Direct Relief to serve approximately 7,400 \nlow-income patients.
