{"page_content": "All of Melco\u2019s integrated resorts are positioned within island economies  \nthat are largely dependent on tourism. Not only do we have  \na responsibility to manage the waste we and our guests generate,  \nbut often isolated from waste processing infrastructure, it is our  \nduty to eliminate the fundamental reasons for plastic pollution. \nAs an early signatory to the Global Tourism Plastics Initiative \u2013 led by  \nthe UN Environment Programme and the World Tourism Organization  \nin collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation \u2013  \nwe have committed to a set of actionable goals and targets by 2025  \nto combat the root causes of plastic pollution17 and report on  \nprogress annually. In 2020, Melco became the first to  \nglobally roll out the NORDAQ water purification  \nand bottling solution, starting with Morpheus at City of Dreams.\n\u201cThe NORDAQ onsite plant can refill 2,000 bottles of  \npurified water per hour, and once we expand to all our properties  \nin Macau in 2021, we will eliminate the production, transportation and \ndisposal of approximately 14.8 million plastic bottles annually.  \nBeyond reducing plastic waste it significantly reduces our  \ncarbon footprint. By 2021, the system will also be  \nfully implemented across our properties globally.\u201d\nDENISE cHENDENISE cHEN\nSENIOR vICE PRESIdENT ANd ChIE f SUSTAINABILITY OffICER ,  \nMELCO RESORTS ANd ENTERTAINMENTReducing Plastic \nWaste and our \nCarbon FootprintcASE STUDYcASE STUDY\nACROSS ALL OPERATIONSOUR cOmmITmENTOUR cOmmITmENT\nWaste can take on many forms; Melco commits to a systems-\nbased approach to understand and manage the full lifecycle \nof waste that we, our partners and our guests use and reuse. \nFrom building construction, water, packaging or food from our \nkitchens, we focus on uncovering opportunities for circularity. \nSustainable material and design choices, along with effective \nwaste management, also help us along our journey to zero-\nwaste resorts and contributing to circular economy \nleadership in Asia.
