Officers handle potential issues of misconduct in \nconfidence, provide guidance and answer any queries our \ncolleagues may have, through direct email or the mail.\nWhistleblowingWhistleblowing\nFor our governance structure to work, trust in the system and \nconfidentiality are critical. Melco has a range of channels for \nour colleagues to voice their concerns and report potential \nviolations of the Code anonymously, including a whistleblowing \nhotline operated by an external party. The hotline can be \naccessed through a dedicated toll-free phone number. \nInternally, the duty falls on the management team, Internal \nAudit, our Ethical Business Advisor and the Human \nResources department to handle concerns and queries. \nDetails of the various channels for raising concerns are \navailable on our intranet and posted within key colleague \nareas of our properties. Approximately ten reports are \nreceived each quarter via the whistleblowing hotline on topics \ntypically related to colleague non-compliance with policies and \nprocedures. All matters raised are investigated and additional \ncontrols implemented, or policies and procedures revised, \nwhere applicable. In 2020, there weren\u2019t any topics raised  \nthat required investigation or related to non-compliances  \nwith Melco\u2019s policies or codes.ETHIcS & INTEgRITYETHIcS & INTEgRITY\nHOw wE ARE mANA gINg IT HOw wE ARE mANA gINg IT108 109 \u2014\u2014\u2014  MELCO RESORTS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MLCO_2020.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
