Other certifications related to environmental and health and safety management \nare referenced in relevant report sections.While pandemic management always features \nas part of our risk register and we have had both \nbusiness continuity plans and best practice \nmanagement plans at the operational and \ncommunity levels in place, the situation in 2020 \nposed unexpected challenges. \nThe gravity of the pandemic, resulting in long-term \noperational shutdowns by government regulators, created \nuncertainty for all businesses. The global gaming and \nhospitality sector, where the flow of revenue relies heavily on \npeople being able to travel within their own geographies and \nacross borders, was severely affected as a result. \nIn response to this, we updated our risk register to distinguish \nbetween black swan risks, unpredictable and rare events that \nhave potentially severe consequences, and other everyday \nrisks. This is significant for Melco, as black swan risks are \noften uninsured, meaning less risk can be transferred to a \nthird party. To address this effectively, we continue to work on \nmore specific risk and crisis management planning focused \non handing events that could trigger prolonged shut downs in \nthe future.\nOur proactive response to the COVID-19 crisis has \nestablished Melco as a leader in our industry. A key focus  \nwith regards to the pandemic has been how we can help \ncolleagues and suppliers continue to work and earn a living \nduring long periods of closure. To address this, we have taken \nquick action on the financing side to make sure we are still \nable to pay colleagues and support suppliers. On the \ncommunity front, our efforts were focused on meeting the \nimmediate and urgent need for protective masks, which we \nwere able to source by tapping into our global network.\nAnother key initiative has of course been the strengthening  \nof health and security measures across our value chain.  \nWe have worked hard to ensure all our health and safety procedures are in compliance with expert-validated best \npractices to minimize the risk and impact of COVID-19 and \nother potential public health events that may occur in the \nfuture. Melco is among the first hotels and resorts in the world \nto achieve the Sharecare Health Security VERIFIED\u00ae \ncertification issued by the Forbes Travel Guide. More details \non our enhanced health and safety measures can be found in \nthe Safety, Health  & Wellbeing  section of this Report.\nOpportunities through Sustainable BusinessOpportunities through Sustainable Business\nThe COVID-19 crisis reinforced our commitment to maintain \nsustainable business success and financial stability in the \nmarkets where we operate. Despite the challenges, we took \nthis opportunity to deepen our engagement with local \nstakeholders, gaining a better understanding of their needs \nand ensuring that we do everything within our power to \nsupport those who are hardest hit. We continued investing in \nour newest projects, including Studio City Phase 2. Looking \nbeyond Macau, we have commenced operations in Cyprus \nand are scheduled to open City of Dreams Mediterranean in \nthe summer of 2022, while in Japan we have our corporate \noffices established. \nLooking ahead we see promising opportunities for Melco to \nforge ahead using technological innovations to capitalize on \ninternal efficiencies and create superior guest experiences in \nareas beyond gaming. \nAs we plan for the future, we continually strive to align the \nsuccessful evolution of our business with our environmental \nand social responsibilities. This entails consistently assessing \nthe impact of our practices, and going beyond in-house \noperations to actively build capacity and collaborate with our \npartners to create value. We are confident that the impact of \nour business success will continue to be felt across our value \nchain, from our shareholders, colleagues and suppliers to \nlocal governments and communities.
