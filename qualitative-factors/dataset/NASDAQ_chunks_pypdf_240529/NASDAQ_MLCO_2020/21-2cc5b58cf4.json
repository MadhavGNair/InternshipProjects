The property site was \nchosen ensuring that the protected 15-hectare wetland, \ndesignated as the Macau Cotai Ecological Zone, was not \ndisturbed. Our planning also included minimizing the impact \nof basement excavation on both the wetland and \nunderground water sources to protect this land that serves  \nas a resting place for many species of migratory birds.  \nOur two hotel tower blocks were carefully engineered to \ncreate a \u2018sky-stream\u2019 that takes into account migratory \npathways for the birds. In addition, an ecologist was consulted \nto preserve existing flora and implement habitat-compatible compensatory planting for the site. For Studio City Phase 2, \nall timber sourced for the building is from Forest Stewardship \nCouncil\u2122 (FSC\u2122) (or equivalent) certified suppliers.\nCity of Dreams Mediterranean\nAt City of Dreams Mediterranean, we have also been working \nextensively with our landscape consultants and agronomists \nto implement recommendations from our BREEAM Ecology \nReport. Some recommendations for enhancement of the \nsite\u2019s ecology and biodiversity include:\n  Revision of the landscape plan to remove invasive foreign \nspecies and include species with low water demand that \nare resilient to climatic conditions in Cyprus \n  Maintenance of the existing mature Eucalyptus  trees \nincluding pruning, application of nutrients, backfilling of \nexposed roots and replacement of dead trees\n  Installation of bird nest, bat roost and insect boxes in \nappropriate locations throughout the site to provide a \nhabitat for those species and maintain the site\u2019s  \necological food chain\n  Monitoring of the wider area to explore the \nimplementation of off-site conservation measures for  \nthe endangered Lotus cytisoides  species \u2013 through  \nthe collection of seeds and planting within the  \nmicro-habitats of the development\nReducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) EmissionsReducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions\nWith operations significantly affected by reductions in room \nnights and guest visitation due to the COVID-19 restrictions, \nGHG emissions reduced by 45% in both absolute and \nintensity terms. We note that energy-efficiency measures as \nwell as increases in both renewable energy generation onsite \nand in our EV fleet and charging points continue to result in \nsubstantial reductions year-on-year. However, 2020 is \nobviously an anomaly and the primary reason for the \nreduction in GHG emissions during the year. We remain \nsteadfast in our efforts to continuously look for new \ntechnologies and innovative solutions to move us toward \nmeeting our 2030 carbon neutrality target. \nIn 2020, our Group-wide Scope 1 and 2 (location-based)  \nGHG emissions decreased by 24% compared with 2019, and \nfor market-based emissions, a 45% reduction was recorded. \nFor our Scope 1 and 2 market-based emission intensity,  \nwe saw a reduction of 92% between the years 2016 and 2019, ENER gY & cLImATE RESILIENcE ENER gY & cLImATE RESILIENcE\nHOw wE ARE mANA gINg IT HOw wE ARE mANA gINg IT040 041 \u2014\u2014\u2014  MELCO RESORTS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MLCO_2020.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
