These very \nvisual approaches raise colleague awareness and also help \nour Food & Beverage (F&B) teams adjust their menus. \nCollectively with all the initiatives we have implemented for \nplate waste in Macau, we saw a reduction of 13% in plate \nwaste in grams per cover in 2020 compared to the previous \nyear. As our resorts recover to full capacity, the impact of the \nawareness campaigns could see a saving of roughly 107 \ntonnes a year. With our learnings from overproduced waste in \nthe kitchens and plate waste in colleague dining areas, we will \ncontinue to share best practices across our properties to \nfurther reduce food waste arising from our colleague, guest \nand tenant dining areas.\nEliminating Single-use PlasticEliminating Single-use Plastic\nMelco has already achieved an important milestone in our \nlong-term commitment toward reducing the use of single-use \nplastic (SUP) and promoting circular economy practices across \nour global operations. The introduction of the NORDAQ 2000 \nwater filtration system  offers automatic water bottle refilling in \na closed-loop onsite. The statistics are staggering \u2013  \nonce operational across our entire Macau portfolio, we will \neliminate 14.8 million plastic bottles annually. This reduction \nof our plastic waste is equivalent to the amount of CO\u00b2 \nabsorbed by 20,263 tree seedlings over a 10-year period12.\ncHALLENgEScHALLENgES\nWe are racing against time to meet our ambitious 2030 \ntargets for carbon neutrality and zero waste. COVID-19 posed \na severe challenge to our waste treatment processes and \naccess to recycling facilities due to border closures. \nFurthermore, in some markets, water in SUP bottles has been \nperceived as more hygienic and preferred by some guests, \nparticularly during the pandemic. Balancing health and safety \nconcerns with environmental impact continues to be a critical \nyet challenging task. \nPartnering with certified and trusted suppliers, raising \nawareness about our high standards along the value chain \nand aligning our sustainability performance across the board \nremain areas of critical focus to achieve our ambitious goals.\n2021 & BEYOND2021 & BEYOND\nWith the successful installation of the revolutionary \nNORDAQ 2000 water filtration system at City of \nDreams Macau, we have initiated plans for a full \nrollout of refillable glass bottles in our guest rooms \nacross all of our properties in Macau by the end of \n2021. In addition to the NORDAQ plastic reduction \ninitiative, we will be installing refillable shower \namenity dispensers as existing disposable \nbathroom amenities are depleted in our guest \nrooms and spas. We will also be expanding our \nsustainable sourcing categories and increasing our \nspend on reduced-impact chemicals.\nT o move forward with our more ambitious efforts in \nenergy and waste management, we are also exploring \nways to further concrete progress. These include:\n\u2022 Collaborating with local networks to find \ncreative solutions for achieving the deep \ndecarbonization of the grid and showing demand \nfor renewable energy through power purchasing \nagreements (PPAs), green tariffs and other \nmechanisms \n\u2022 Improving our diversion of waste from disposal \nthrough awareness raising, engaging our tenants \nand suppliers, reviewing and enhancing our \nonsite practices and adopting new technologies \nand other innovations \n\u2022 Exploring options for enhancing and accessing \nrecycling facilities within the Greater Bay Area \n(GBA), in partnership with local contractors6.

To achieve our goal of carbon neutrality, we are focused on first increasing energy \nconsumed from renewable sources, which are generated onsite or through power \npurchasing agreements, for example, and then purchasing Energy Attributable \nCertificates or other market instruments, in quantities equivalent to the amount of \nenergy that is consumed through non-renewable sources.\n8. Achieving zero waste means avoiding the disposal of all waste materials to landfill or \nother treatment or disposal methods that do not involve the recovery, reuse, \nrecycling or repurposing of the material or the generation of energy.\n9.  https://www.epa.gov/warm\n10.
