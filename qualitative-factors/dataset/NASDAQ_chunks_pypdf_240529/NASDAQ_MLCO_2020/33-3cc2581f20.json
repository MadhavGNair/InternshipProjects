This broadens their range of perspectives and \nbuilds new skills and experience beyond their known \nexpertise. Experiences can vary from one day to several \nmonths or a long-term transfer, and might comprise a single \ntask, a series of projects or provide a glimpse into new skills \ndesigned to stretch and inspire them.
