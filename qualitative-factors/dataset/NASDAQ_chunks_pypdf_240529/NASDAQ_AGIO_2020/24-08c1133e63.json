{"page_content": "ESG R eport 2021As part of our mission to improve the lives of patients with cancer and genetically defined diseases, Agios partners with advocacy groups on \nimportant initiatives designed to offer broad and holistic support for these communities. For example, we supported the coalition building efforts \nof the Thalassemia International Federation (TIF), which resulted in the first patient advocacy group for all hemolytic anemias. For patients with \ncertain rare or under-served hemolytic anemias, this group represents the first organized advocacy organization for their condition. Through both \nhands-on collaboration and financial donations, Agios is proud to advance TIF\u2019s mission to ensure equal access to quality health care for every \npatient with thalassemia and other hemoglobin disorders across the world.\nSharing the same healthcare infrastructure and services, \nin many cases the same doctors and centers, as well as \nhaving similar treatment requirements, it only makes \nsense for patients with rare anemias to come together \nand join forces in order to amplify individual advocacy \nefforts. Patient organizations such as TIF, through \nsuch initiatives, have the opportunity to share their \nknowledge and expertise \u2013 acquired over a period of \nthirty years \u2013 with more recently founded organizations. \nWe feel truly blessed that this realization is echoed by \nAgios and that together we will walk hand-in-hand to \nunify the patient voice so no rare anemia patient ever \nfeels alone! Through this partnership, our community of \nrare anemias can achieve more! \nDr. Androulla Eleftheriou  \nExecutive Director, Thalassaemia International FederationCASE STUDY: THALASSEMIA INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA PATIENT COALITION\n25", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGIO_2020.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
