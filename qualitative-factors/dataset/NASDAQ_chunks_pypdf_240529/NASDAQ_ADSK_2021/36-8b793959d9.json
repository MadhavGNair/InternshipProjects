{"page_content": "Habitat for Humanity International\u2019s Terwilliger \nCenter for Innovation in Shelter \nAccelerating access  \nto adequate shelter\nTo bring innovation into the affordable housing sector, \nHabitat for Humanity\u2019s Terwilliger Center launched \nShelterTech, a global innovation platform advancing \nentrepreneurial housing solutions with the potential \nto radically improve the lives of low\u2011income families. \nIn 2020, with financial and technical support from \nthe Autodesk Foundation, ShelterTech launched new \naccelerator programs in Southeast Asia and in the \nAndean region of South America, supporting housing \nproduct and service innovations advancing shelter \ngoals in the context of the COVID\u201119 pandemic. \nParticipants in ShelterTech receive the business \nsupport and mentorship they need to successfully \nlaunch and scale housing innovations for vulnerable \ncommunities. Program participants are eligible to \naccess Autodesk software from Autodesk\u2019s Technology \nImpact Program. Habitat for Humanity has benefited \nfrom Autodesk Technology Impact Program to build \naffordable housing with the Autodesk AEC Collection \nsince 2015. \n\u201cWe are pleased to invest in ShelterTech to identify \nand support creative new solutions to the affordable \nhousing crisis around the globe. With an increasingly \ncrowded planet, the need to design and build safer, \nmore resilient housing infrastructure is paramount. \nWe\u2019re eager to see what talented entrepreneurs in \nSoutheast Asia can do with the right mix of expertise, \ntechnology, and financing,\u201d says Joe Speicher, \nAutodesk Foundation Executive Director. \u00a0BuildX\u00a0Studio \nDesigning affordable \ncircular housing\n\u201cUltimately, we want all new buildings to be net\u2011zero \ncarbon buildings,\u201d says James Mitchell, co\u2011founder \nand CEO of\u00a0 BuildX\u00a0Studio , a design\u2011and\u2011build \nfirm\u00a0based in Nairobi, Kenya. Autodesk Foundation \nhas funded\u00a0BuildX\u00a0Studio\u2019s innovations in circular \naffordable urban housing innovation in East Africa \nsince 2019.\u00a0\nA primary aim for all\u00a0BuildX\u00a0projects is to replace \nhigh\u2011carbon methods and materials with locally \nsourced, low\u2011carbon alternatives. Another\u00a0objective  \nis to create opportunities for women in construction. \nHalf of\u00a0BuildX\u2019s\u00a0construction workers, and more than \nhalf of its office employees and leadership, are women.\u00a0\nBuildX\u2019s focus on sustainability\u00a0doesn\u2019t end with \nfeatures such as energy\u2011efficient appliances \nand\u00a0water\u2011saving fixtures. BuildX also works to \nreduce embodied carbon, the carbon associated \nwith materials and the\u00a0building process itself, \nwhich accounts for 11% of a building\u2019s total carbon \nemissions.\u00a0BuildX\u00a0Studio uses BIM 360 and Autodesk\u00ae \nAutoCAD\u00ae software to analyze building information \nand generate sustainable design solutions\u00a0that \nconsider lighting, ventilation, material use, climate \nresponsiveness, and the building lifecycle.\nThe\u00a0Sachibondu\u00a0Rural Health Centre ,\u00a0completed in \n2019, illustrates the firm\u2019s sustainability strategy. \nMore than 80% of the building materials were sourced \nor produced\u00a0locally,\u00a0and the project employed 120 \nlocal workers, half of them women. The hospital is \nnow accessible to tens of thousands of people across \nZambia, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nWith support from the \nAutodesk Foundation, \nHabitat for Humanity\u2019s \nShelterTech platform is \naccelerating global housing \ninnovations in Southeast \nAsia\u00a0and Latin\u00a0America.\nLearn more\nLearn moreImage courtesy of Chevy Thom Image courtesy of Habitat \nfor Humanity ShelterTech\nLearn more\n37\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Health & Resilience", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
