{"page_content": "Autodesk  \nTechnology  \nCenters\nThe Autodesk Technology Centers catalyze new \npossibilities for making through the power of \nconnection. They bring together a global network \nof innovation leaders, data\u2011enabled fabrication \nworkshops, and curated experiences to empower \ninnovators in achieving the new possible. With \nphysical sites in San Francisco, Boston, Toronto, \nand Birmingham, UK, the Technology Centers are a \nconnection engine where resident teams can combine \ncross\u2011industry or cross\u2011continent collaboration \nwith hands\u2011on construction and fabrication. From \nexploring ideas on the future of design to testing \nnew methods of production, industry teams within \nand outside of Autodesk can conduct speculative \nand thought\u2011leading work pertaining to design and \nmake\u00a0technology. \nPrior to the COVID\u201119 pandemic, the programming \nfor each center was strongly tied to its physical \nsite. The closure of these sites inspired the team to \npivot to cloud\u2011native programs. This enabled the \nTechnology Centers to shift their focus from local \nto global innovation and reimagine what the future \nof making could look like. With the development of \nthe Outsight Network, a redesigned version of the \nTechnology Centers\u2019 residency program, the centers \nwere able to onboard resident teams from over 20 \ncountries in 2020, increasing their global footprint \nand impact. The enhancement of digital programming \nand experiences (targeted at bringing a cross\u2011section \nof innovators together) resulted in more resident \nteam collaborations that pushed the boundaries \nof workflow coordination and production. With the \naddition of the Connected Workshops initiative, \nwhich will integrate equipment and facilities around \ndata, the Technology Centers are well positioned to \naccelerate fostering global open innovation through  \na hybrid model approach. \nMarion Surgical , a maker of surgical \nsimulators, is hoping to change the field \nof surgical education by building the \nworld\u2019s first virtual reality and haptic \nfeedback training platform for surgeons. \nHaptic feedback on the fully customizable \nsimulators helps surgeons improve \nmuscle memory, which can potentially \nincrease the overall quality of surgical and \nmedical care for patients.\nLearn moreCosm Medical  is combining a new \nultrasound technology with data \nscience and 3D printing to create \nGynethotics, the world\u2019s first \ncustom gynecological prosthetic, \nso more people can live and age \nwith dignity and grace. \nLearn more\nForceN Inc.  provides a digital sense of \ntouch for high\u2011reliability robotics in \nsurgery, manufacturing, and aerospace/\ndefense. This provides immediate use \nin human teleoperation and simple \nautomation as well as recording a library \nof tactile data for training future semi/\nfully autonomous systems. \nLearn more\nThe Okoa Project  is a nonprofit dedicated \nto increasing access to health care in \nrural communities through the creation \nof innovative technologies. Their primary \nproduct is a motorcycle ambulance  \ntrailer that can transport a patient,  \nmedical supplies, and one other person.  \nThe Okoa production workshop is in in \nMbeya, Tanzania. \nLearn more\nFlux Marine  is bringing the electric \nvehicle revolution to the marine \nindustry. The team has designed a clean, \npowerful, and reliable electric outboard \nmotor system to be manufactured and \nmarketed to commercial, military, and \nrecreational boating sectors.

Coral Maker  is \nfounded on the idea of repurposing existing \nmanufacturing technology to quickly mass \nproduce live corals for reef restoration. \nIntegrating concepts from the manufacturing \nindustry (automation, mass production, \n3D printing) with those from coral science \n(propagation, fusing and recoating surfaces), \nCoral Maker\u2019s process bypasses much of the \ncalcification required for coral colonies to \nachieve adult size.\nLearn more\n58\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Work & Prosperity", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
