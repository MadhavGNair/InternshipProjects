{"page_content": "Foster a culture of belonging\nWe are committed to building a culture of belonging \nat Autodesk by listening deeply to our colleagues \nabout their experiences, providing education on the \nprinciples of belonging, implementing programs \nto embed those principles in our culture, and most \nimportantly, fostering collective accountability for \nbuilding belonging at Autodesk.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nOur Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are on the \nfront lines of transforming our culture, and this year \nwe went further to make sure they are positioned to \nmake an impact. Each ERG is sponsored by a member \nof our Executive Leadership Team, and our ERG \nleaders are supported as a critical extension of our \nD&B team. We have seven voluntary, employee\u2011led \ngroups: The Asian Network, Black Network, Latinx \nNetwork, Pride Network, Veterans Network, Women\u2019s \nNetwork, and Young Professionals Network. All \nplay key roles in driving professional development, \nbuilding partnerships with local communities, \nadvancing recruitment efforts, and supporting a \nculture of mentorship and coaching. During April 2021, \nwe held ERG Week, featuring guest speakers along \nwith a robust suite of global activities intended to \nincrease participation. We held more than 25 ERG\u2011led \nevents during 2020. We also offer several professional and leadership \ndevelopment opportunities for all employees, \nincluding our Emerging Leaders Program and \nEmployee Leadership Program/Autodesk Leadership \nProgram. All of our training programs are offered \nglobally. The introduction of MyLearning puts the \nlearner in the driver seat to consume and utilize \nlearning in new and innovative ways. Learning and \ndevelopment is a key part of Autodesk\u2019s employee \nstrategy, so we will continue to introduce more \nprograms and evolve our existing offerings for  \nall employees. \nIn addition, all employees can participate in the \nAutodesk Mentorship Program, either as a mentor, \nmentee, or both. The program is designed to \nbreak down the barriers of meeting and learning \nfrom colleagues around the world. We provide all \nparticipants with a toolkit of resources and guidance. \nAs of May 2021, we had 2,500 active members in \nthe program. The latest offerings include two new \ntracks launched in April 2021, Autodesk Mentorship \nCircles and Flash Mentorship. These take individual \nmentorship to the next level by providing mentorship \nopportunities in both group and short\u2011term formats. \nGlobalizing Autodesk leadership\nAs a global company, it is critical that our leadership \nreflects the perspectives of our customers around \nthe world.
