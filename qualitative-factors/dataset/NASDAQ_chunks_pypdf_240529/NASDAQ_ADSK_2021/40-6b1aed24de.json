{"page_content": "Living our Culture\nTo help build our Culture Code into all aspects of our \nwork life, we have launched a series of all\u2011employee \nlearning experiences and activities we call Culture \nSprints. Sprints provide skills and reflective exercises \nthat help employees bring aspects of our Culture Code \nto life. We put our Culture Code into action with team \nconversations, and with manager\u2011led workshops to \nhelp teams identify actions they can take to overcome \nbarriers of living our culture as a company. More than \ntraining, our Sprints help us develop new behaviors, \nmindsets, and shared language to operationalize our \nculture in sustained and meaningful ways. Each Sprint \ngives us the opportunity to examine our current \nactions, identify roadblocks, and apply practical \nsolutions. By the end of each Sprint, participants \nform new habits and processes, both individually and \norganizationally, to make our culture real at Autodesk. \nAll employees at Autodesk participate in our Sprints \nthrough learning paths designed for both individual \nexploration and team sessions. So far, we have \nconducted three Sprints. \nThrough these and other efforts, we will continue  \nto strengthen and embed our Culture Code  \nthroughout the company, as shown in the report \nsections that follow.Courage (2019)\nOur first Sprint focused on courage, the foundation \nof our culture transformation toward becoming a \nCustomer Company. Courage fosters an environment \nwhere it\u2019s safe to speak up and say the hard things, \nbut in ways that allow others to listen and hear us \n\u2014and where we remain open to hearing what others \nhave to say. Through the Sprint, we learned about \nthree components of courage as a company: how to \nfoster psychological safety, how to listen openly, and \nhow to respond and challenge constructively. \nEmpower Decision Makers (2020)\nEmpowering decision makers leads to faster, more \nrobust, and more effective decisions. The Empower \nDecision Makers Sprint directly builds on our efforts \nto strengthen courage across Autodesk. When we \nhave the courage to debate ideas and engage in \nmore inclusive decision\u2011making practices, we make \nbetter\u00a0decisions. \nBelonging (2021)\nBelonging is not just a business imperative, it\u2019s a \nmoral imperative, and integral to truly living our \nCulture Code. As a global company that works in more \nthan 40 countries and speaks dozens of languages, \nwe believe that embracing differences and building \nbelonging helps us all do our best work and thrive. \nThe Sprint brings us together to learn, to listen, and to \nexplore what belonging means to us individually, as \nteams, and as a company.
