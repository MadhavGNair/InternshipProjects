{"page_content": "At Autodesk, we work to maintain a strong health and \nsafety culture. We help our employees work safely and \nproductively through participation in programs that \nmitigate occupational safety risks in our workplaces. \nAll company sites have emergency response plans, \nand many also have safety committees and emergency \nresponse teams to help keep our employees safe. \nThe health, safety, and productivity of our people \nhave remained high priorities during the pandemic. \nAutodesk has worked to minimize the impact of \nCOVID\u201119 on our employees by providing flexible \nhours, offering new employee holidays to avoid \nburnout, offering reimbursements to employees \nto improve their home workspaces, and providing \nresources and support for inner well\u2011being, social  \nconnection, and physical health . Another key \nelement of Autodesk\u2019s internal response was regular \ncommunications from CEO Andrew Anagnost and \nother leaders, as well as ongoing updates on our \ninternal website regarding items such as infection \nrates, local government regulations, and vaccine \ntracking. Already high employee engagement \nscores increased over the course of the pandemic, \nas measured by the company\u2019s regular survey of \nemployee sentiment.Ergonomic injuries can be a leading source of risk, \nin the office setting or at home. To prevent this, we \noffer an online ergonomic self\u2011assessment safety \nand training program that tracks personal ergonomic \nrisks identified by employees and suggests alternative \nwork habits to potentially resolve those issues. During \n2020, in response to the pandemic, we provided \nincreased guidance for employees in home\u2011based \nsettings. If issues persist despite the employee\u2019s \nbest efforts, professional ergonomists are available \nto provide further assessments and recommend \ncorrective measures, including work habit changes \nand, in some cases, workstation modifications. \nDuring 2020, the recordable incident rate at Autodesk \n(including home\u2011based work) equaled 0.02, compared \nto the NAICS software industry rate of 0.2 for 2019 \n(the most recent year available). Our days away, \nrestrictions, and transfers (DART) rate equaled 0.00.\nEmployee \nhealth and \nsafety\nSee details in the Data summary .Improve our operations\n27\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Health & Resilience", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
