The more \nrecent occurrences of violence against the Asian \ncommunity in the United States and globally are \nalso appalling and unacceptable. At Autodesk, we \nchampion the effort to end violence and injustice, \nand we are committed to doing our part to create \nopportunities for mutual connection and empathy \namong all people.

This included providing learning and restoration \nsessions for Black employees\u00a0to connect and support one another and delivering a company\u2011wide listening \nsession to give voice to employees\u2019 experiences and \npain of racism.

The Foundation\u2019s response and rebuilding \ngrants and support have benefited from collaboration \nwith the company\u2019s D&B team and ERGs representing \nthe people and communities impacted. Beyond this \nfunding, the Foundation has committed to integrating \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion goals throughout its \nwork, from how it sources new organizations for its \nportfolio to the impact it seeks to realize through its \ngrantmaking and impact investing.Belonging Sprint\nIn March 2021, we kicked off our four\u2011month\u2011long \nall\u2011employee Belonging Sprint to bring employees \ntogether to learn, listen, and explore what belonging \nmeans to us individually, as teams, and as a company. \nHerminia Ibarra, Professor of Organisational \nBehaviour at London Business School and an expert \nin\u00a0authentic leadership, keynoted the kickoff event.\nThe Foundations of Belonging virtual workshop \nenables managers to lead their teams through \nreflective prompts and commitments.
