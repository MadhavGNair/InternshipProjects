{"page_content": "Salvage: Katrina Urbanik \nImagining a  \nWILD new world\nKatrina Urbanik AS has a bold vision for WILD\u2014a \nfloating human\u2011made island conceived as both a \nresidential development and a travel destination. \nLocated in Norway, WILD is designed to produce \nits own power, fresh water, food, and heat. The \ndevelopment includes housing, greenhouses, solar \npanels, a car park, and a tidal energy plant. \nSpecial attention was paid to the island fa\u00e7ade, made \nof self\u2011curing bio\u2011active concrete that absorbs CO2. \nLocal species of mussels will grow on the fa\u00e7ade. \nUsing Dynamo and Revit, the design team compared \nfa\u00e7ade options in relation to daylight penetration \nand solar insulation and quickly created and tested \nmultiple project scenarios. \nThe designers use BIM 360 cloud\u2011based services \nto connect project teams for full project visibility, \nreal\u2011time status, multi\u2011discipline coordination, and \ndesign collaboration. As the review phase of the \nWILD\u00a0project nears completion during the pandemic, \nthe collaboration afforded by BIM 360 technology \nhas\u00a0been even more important. With the Autodesk \nAEC\u00a0Collection, the team has saved 30% of design \ntime, successfully meeting deadlines and enabling \nmore sustainable outcomes.\nLearn moreSee a summary of Autodesk Architecture, \nEngineering & Construction solutions that \nenable sustainable design.WILD is designed to produce \nits own power, fresh water, \nfood, and heat. Lean construction \nLean construction , enabled by Autodesk Construction \nCloud, supports higher\u2011quality, more\u2011efficient \nconstruction projects by allowing general contractors, \nsubcontractors, and owners to optimize workflows \nto increase overall productivity and reduce risk \nthroughout the project lifecycle. When tradespeople \nare empowered to make decisions that affect the \nproject schedule, bottlenecks are avoided, waste \nis reduced, and projects proceed more smoothly. \nExpanding these capabilities, we acquired Pype in \n2020, which uses artificial intelligence and machine \nlearning to extract and process data from project \nplans and specifications, improving project quality, \nefficiency, and risk management. \nInfrastructure\nMore efficient road network systems have the \npotential to reduce energy consumption, local \npollutant emissions, delays, and traffic congestion, \nwhile improving safety.\nAutodesk also helps customers understand and \nreduce environmental impacts associated with \nroadways and transportation infrastructure. Using \nthe integrated multi\u2011modal Mobility Simulation \nengine for Autodesk\u00ae InfraWorks\u00ae, designers can \ncreate animated simulations of transit, parking, \npersonal, and/or taxi\u2011mode modeling. Metrics \nsuch as person\u2011hours traveled, person\u2011kilometers \ntraveled, multi\u2011modal level of service calculations, \nand economic and environmental assessments \nhelp planners understand the relative impacts of \ndifferent scenarios. This supports the development \nof more efficient road network systems, which has \nthe potential to reduce energy consumption, local \npollutant emissions, delays, and traffic congestion, \nand improve safety.Image courtesy of Katrina Urbanik AS\n17\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
