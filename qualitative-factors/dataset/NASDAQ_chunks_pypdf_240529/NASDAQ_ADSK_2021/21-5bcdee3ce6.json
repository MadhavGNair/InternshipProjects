One example is Untold Studios, \nan independent creative studio based in London that \nmakes content across music, TV, and advertising. \nArtists use simple monitors to connect to virtual \nmachines, enabling seamless remote collaboration \nand making it easier for the company to scale and \naccommodate project workload. The studio currently \nuses Autodesk\u00ae Shotgun\u00ae production management \nsoftware, Maya 3D digital content creation tools, and \nFlame\u00ae VFX and finishing tools for final compositing.\nLarge productions such as films, episodic content, \nand games often involve the collaboration of many \nstudios. This can involve multiple versions of \nanimated characters, visual effects, and other digital \nassets, which increases the use of IT equipment \nand energy. Autodesk is working with the Academy \nSoftware Foundation on open source standards to \ndecrease the need for multiple versions of digital \nassets, as well as simplifying customer workflows \nin\u2011studio and between studios.\nTo advance progress toward a more sustainable cloud, \nwe are a signatory to The Corporate Colocation and  \nCloud Buyers\u2019 Principles , a project of the Future of \nInternet Power Collaborative Initiative.The media and entertainment industry is challenged \nto meet the demands of a tremendous increase in \ncontent consumption globally, and many companies \nare accelerating their digitization plans. While this \ncreates opportunities for individuals and studios \nworldwide, our customers are also increasingly \nworking to manage and reduce their environmental \nfootprints. Autodesk helps by enabling cloud\u2011based \nrendering, supporting virtualized workflows, and \nadvancing relevant third\u2011party standards and \nprinciples.\nMedia and entertainment companies often have \nthousands or tens of thousands of servers for \nsimulation, rendering, and other tasks. Shifting to \ncloud\u2011based solutions can reduce GHG emissions, \nsince those services are typically more efficient \nthan company\u2011owned and managed servers. \nThrough partnerships with cloud service providers, \nAutodesk customers can use tools like Arnold global \nillumination renderer on\u2011premises or in the cloud. \nWith our virtualization policy and cloud rights that \ncome with the software, customers can also bring \nsolutions such as Autodesk\u00ae 3ds Max\u00ae, Maya\u00ae, and \nArnold software, and Arnold to the cloud and purchase \ncompute time (including through our carbon neutral \ncloud services).\nShifting to cloud\u2011based \nsolutions can reduce GHG \nemissions, since those \nservices are typically \nmore efficient than \ncompany\u2011owned and \nmanaged servers.\n22\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials\nPartner with customers", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
