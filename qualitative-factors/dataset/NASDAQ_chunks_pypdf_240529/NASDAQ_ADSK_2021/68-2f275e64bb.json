Fiscal year 2020 fleet \nemissions were restated to align with the fiscal year 2021 methodology.\n37 Data for fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 are calculated using the \nmarket\u2011based accounting method, which takes into account purchased \nrenewable energy offsets.\n38 These data are calculated based on the economic input\u2011output lifecycle \nassessment model, using industry\u2011specific emissions factors in \nconjunction with Autodesk\u2019s spend. In fiscal year 2021, the US. EPA\u2019s \nenvironmentally extended input\u2011output emissions factors are used, and \nfiscal year 2020 emissions were recalculated and restated to align with this \nfactor set.\n39 Emissions for \u201ccapital goods\u201d were calculated based on annual spend.\n40 In fiscal year 2021, the FERA emissions calculation methodogy was refined \nto use market\u2011based factors for the electricity\u2011related emissions. The fiscal \nyear 2020 FERA emissions were recalculated and restated to align with the \nfiscal year 2021 methodology. \n41 Business travel emissions have been calculated using actual data and the \neconomic input\u2011output lifecycle assessment model. In fiscal year 2021, air \ntravel data are based on flights flown (rather than transactions), and fiscal \nyear 2020 air travel emissions were restated using flights flown to align \nwith the fiscal year 2021 methodology.\n42 In fiscal year 2021, remote worker GHG emissions are included, and fiscal \nyear 2020 remote worker GHG emissions were calculated and added to \nalign with the fiscal year 2021 methodology.\n43 In fiscal year 2021, the end\u2011of\u2011life treatment of sold products emissions \nwere less than 0.5 metric tons CO2e and are rounded to zero in this table.\n44 Scope 3 indirect energy reported includes energy from remote work, \nevents, cloud, and data centers. \n45 Fiscal year 2020 RE100 achieved using previously reported methodologies \nand boundaries.\n46 LEED certifications as of January 31, 2021, include facilities in Beijing, \nChina; Mumbai, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; Milan, Italy; Singapore; and the \nfollowing in the United States: San Francisco, California; San Rafael, \nCalifornia; Boston, Massachusetts.\n47 Includes waste from major conferences and facilities.
