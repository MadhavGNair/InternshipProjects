{"page_content": "Catalyze  \ninnovation\nThrough the Autodesk Foundation, we invest \nin entrepreneurs and innovators scaling \ntechnology\u2011based solutions that improve resilience \nin low resource communities most vulnerable to \nclimate change. We focus our investments on the built \nenvironment, agriculture, energy access, and water \nand sanitation, where technology and design and \nmake can have the greatest positive impact.\nFrom retrofitting homes in Colombia to better \nwithstand earthquakes to mass manufacturing \ndesign\u2011forward handwashing and drinking stations  \nfor children in Kolkata, India, the Autodesk Foundation \nportfolio fosters health and enhances community \nresilience through technological innovation.

By running their existing Revit files\u00a0through \nInsight 360, BHI identified unnecessary lighting, \nwhich reduced the one\u2011time cost of constructing the \nbuilding as well as the long\u2011term energy\u00a0costs.\nBIM gives us the power to \nunderstand how design choices \naffect energy use. We use \nthe model to find ways to keep \nbuildings cool and well\u2011lit while \nminimizing reliance on electricity.\u201d\nJim Ansara, Founder BHI\nRead the Autodesk Foundation\u2019s \nResilient Communities impact brief .\nLearn more22\nnonprofits and startups fostering \nhealth and community resilience \nthrough technological innovation\n51%\nof Autodesk Foundation portfolio \nfunding in fiscal year 2021 \nHealth and resilience during COVID\u201119 \nCOVID\u201119 has underscored the need for improved health care capacity, infrastructure, and \nsupporting systems, and demonstrates the critical importance of personal, economic, and \nsocietal resilience. In 2020, Autodesk Foundation joined a consortium of 25 companies that \ncommitted $22 million in funding to global, national, and San Francisco Bay Area solutions to \naddress COVID\u201119 .\nTo support Autodesk Foundation customers most impacted by COVID\u201119, we deployed \naccelerated funding renewals and stability funding and used new forms of financing, including \ndebt obligations and convertible notes. These efforts supported the solvency of our portfolio \norganizations, which tend to be earlier\u2011stage and more vulnerable to cash flow\u00a0shocks.We focus on regions most \nvulnerable to climate change, \nincluding sub\u2011Saharan Africa, the \nIndian subcontinent, Southeast \nAsia, and South America.
