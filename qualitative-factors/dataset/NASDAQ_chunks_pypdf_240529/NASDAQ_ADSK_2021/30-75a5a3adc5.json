{"page_content": "The Afsluitdijk \nReinforcing the largest  \ndam in the Netherlands  \nwith digital construction  \nand BIM\nFor more than 85 years, the 32\u2011kilometer Afsluitdijk dam has been \na hallmark of Dutch hydraulic engineering, but sea level rise and \nclimate change have made revitalization necessary. The complex, \nmultidisciplinary project includes raising and strengthening the dam \nwith 75,000 innovative prefabricated concrete blocks; reconstructing \nthe lock complex with two pumping stations; creating access ways \nfor migrating fish; and designing a bicycle path while widening the \nemergency lanes. With more than 500 people from architecture, civil \nengineering, and construction working together during the design \nand preconstruction process, effective cross\u2011discipline collaboration \nwas key to the project\u2019s success. Teams are using Revit with Autodesk \nConstruction Cloud solutions and Assemble to integrate 3D modeling \nand streamline review cycles, reducing design coordination time by as \nmuch as 80%. And digital construction and prefabrication helped achieve \nan estimated 56% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to alternative \nsolutions. When completed, the dam is expected to withstand\u00a0a \nonce\u2011in\u2011every\u2011ten\u2011thousand\u2011year storm.\n56%\nestimated reduction \nin\u00a0CO2 emissions Read the case study Watch the videoImage courtesy of Royal BAM Group\n80%\nin design \ncoordination time\n31\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Health & Resilience", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
