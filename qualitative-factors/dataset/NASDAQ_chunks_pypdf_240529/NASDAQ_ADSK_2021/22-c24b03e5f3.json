In addition to \nstartups, we fund accelerators, incubators, and \nimpact funds to bolster the growth of the climate \nstartup ecosystem, increasing the number of \nclimate technologies that reach commercialization. \nWe prioritize sectors where our design and make \nexpertise is particularly beneficial, such as renewable \nenergy, electrification of transportation and \nrefrigeration, building and industrial energy efficiency, \nand materials innovation and efficiency. \nFrom electric aircraft to high\u2011efficiency and \nlow\u2011emission home heating and cooling systems, the \nAutodesk Foundation portfolio is accelerating the \ntransition to a low\u2011carbon future.

Autodesk Foundation has invested in Factor[e] since 2017, \nsupporting their industrial design team to scale impact\u2011forward innovations. \nFactor[e] provides its portfolio companies with in\u2011house industrial \ndesign support to facilitate product and system design, development, and \nmanufacturing while reducing costs, helping them scale faster with less risk \nand greater impact. Each organization in Factor[e]\u2019s portfolio requires rapid \ncycles of product development, which they are able to achieve with donated \nsoftware and technical training and resources from Autodesk\u2019s Technology \nImpact Program. Factor[e]\u2019s portfolio uses Fusion 360 and Inventor to design \nand improve innovations such as solar conduction dryers, motor sensors, \nelectric motorcycles, and biogas generation technologies. BamCore, a building technology startup, that manufactures prefabricated wall \nsystems from timber bamboo was added to Autodesk Foundation\u2019s portfolio \nin 2020. The company\u2019s hollow wall framing solution shrinks a building\u2019s \ncarbon footprint and speeds up construction. Builders using BamCore\u2019s Prime \nWall system can eliminate 80% of wood studs, headers, and posts, saving \nmaterials and time. Because the panels are hollow, they transfer less heat and \ncold between inner and outer surfaces and can hold more insulation, lowering \nenergy costs for the final occupant. \nUsing the Autodesk Forge platform, BamCore builds a 3D model of the \npanels that is then shared with the trades so they can design in mechanical, \nengineering, and plumbing features before panel fabrication. This interactive \ndesign fosters collaboration and streamlines the design, bid, and build process. \nOnce the plans have been finalized, the BamCore panels are precut at the \nfactory to millimeter accuracy for every door, window, outlet, and access panel. \nMEPI maps and nail patterns are drawn onto the panels to eliminate rework and \nto speed installation. The walls are numbered, palletized, and delivered to the \njobsite. No heavy equipment is required. Three laborers with a pneumatic nail \ngun can do the installation in half the time of conventional construction.\nImage courtesy of BamCore\nImage courtesy of Factor[e] Ventures\n23\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials\nAdvance industries", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
