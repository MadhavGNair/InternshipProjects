{"page_content": "Accelerate  \ncollaborationShape  \npolicies\nOvercoming global challenges like climate change \nrequires new ways of working together and sharing \ninformation to develop and scale novel solutions. \nWe are proud to work with experts, trendsetters, and \nleaders to shape best practices, share our expertise \nand learn from others, and join our voices to create \nsystems change. This year we worked with industry \norganizations like ENCORD and the Lean Construction \nInstitute to shape best practices on efficiency in the \nconstruction process. We also partnered with Ceres \nBICEP, the Bay Area Business Council on Climate \nChange, and the Digital Climate Alliance to shape \npublic policy on green building at multiple scales.\nWe are proud to be members of collaborative \norganizations including:\nEnabling more sustainable  \nconstruction and manufacturing \nThe building industry is increasingly focused on \nmaking net\u2011zero buildings, reducing embodied \ncarbon, minimizing construction waste, and building \nsmarter, more resilient, and more sustainable cities. \nManufacturers are developing more sustainable \nproducts\u2014like lighter\u2011weight car parts that lead \nto better fuel efficiency\u2014and reducing waste in \nmanufacturing through rapid prototyping, additive \nmanufacturing, and other processes driven by \ndigital tools. But action by private industry alone \nisn\u2019t enough. We cannot\u00a0meaningfully address \nclimate change without significant government \naction. We collaborate with policymakers and other \ncompanies to spur more sustainable construction \nand\u00a0manufacturing. \nAutodesk supports policies and international efforts \nto promote measurement and reduction of carbon \nemissions, energy efficiency, and waste reduction \nin our industries, as well as broader market\u2011based \nefforts to tackle climate change. \nLearn moreWe cannot\u00a0meaningfully \naddress climate change \nwithout significant \ngovernment action.These include: \nFostering use of technology to design and construct sustainable \ninfrastructure and buildings that produce less waste, limit the use \nof carbon\u2011intensive materials, and improve energy efficiency. \nDeveloping embodied carbon reporting and reduction policies. \nSupporting training and other programs that promote the use \nof advanced manufacturing technologies that help design more \nsustainable products and reduce waste in the manufacturing\u00a0process. \nAdopting market\u2011based carbon reduction\u00a0programs.\nSee our  recent CDP Climate \nchange disclosure for a \ndetailed list of climate\u2011related \npolicy engagements .Advance industries\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we engaged with government \nofficials, nonprofit organizations, and other entities \nto advance policies focused on clean buildings and \nsustainable infrastructure. \nAdvancing digital transformation in \nthe manufacturing and architecture, \nengineering, and construction industries\nAutodesk believes better use of technology can \nhelp transform the design and construction process \nso that it is more innovative, efficient, safer, more \nsustainable, and better managed throughout its \nlifecycle. We support public policies that foster \ngreater adoption of digital design and construction \ntools for public infrastructure and building projects, \nincluding those that support the use of BIM and \nconstruction management technologies.\n24\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
