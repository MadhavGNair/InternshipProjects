{"page_content": "PlasticRoad \nA prefabricated  \nroad made of  \nrecycled plastic\n\u201cOur goal is to develop the most sustainable \ninfrastructure in the world,\u201d says Anne Koudstaal, \nDirector of Product at the Netherlands startup, \nPlasticRoad. Their signature product\u2014a prefabricated \nroad made of recycled plastic\u2014is a solid step \ntoward\u00a0sustainability. \nOne important objective for PlasticRoad was to \nmanage water runoff to help control flooding. The \nroad they designed houses an ingenious water \nmanagement system\u2014prefab hollow road sections \ncollect rainwater, which then dissipates slowly into \nthe ground without causing dangerous runoff. \nPlasticRoad has numerous additional advantages \ncompared to conventional asphalt roads. A \nLearn moreGreendzine \nLow\u2011speed EVs,  \nfaster to market\nGreendzine, a startup based in Bangalore, India, is using \ndesign modularity to fight poor urban air quality. The \ncompany creates low\u2011speed electric vehicles (EVs) for \npersonal and industrial use\u2014more quickly than anyone \nelse in the industry. Using Autodesk\u00ae Fusion 360 and \nInventor\u00ae software to create 3D models, designers \nproduce new prototypes using 3D printing\u2014part of an \naccelerated product development strategy they call \n\u201cconcept to product in 90 days.\u201d So far, the product line \nconsists of a two\u2011wheeled personal commuter EV; a \nsporty, three\u2011wheel EV; and an order\u2011picking vehicle \ntailored for commercial warehousing operations. The \ncompany is part of Autodesk\u2019s Technology Impact \nProgram, which donates software to organizations \nthat promote environmental or social good. Ultimately, \nGreendzine\u2019s aim is to develop EVs that are not only \naffordable but also sustainable, making electric mobility \nthe preferred choice in India.\nLearn more\nPlasticRoad lasts three times longer, can be \nconstructed in less than a third of the time, and \nresults in up to 72% less CO2 emissions. In addition, \nPlasticRoad does not require complex excavation \nwork, heavy foundations, or concrete slabs or asphalt.\nFinite element analysis (FEA) software from Autodesk \nplayed an important role in the development of this \nproduct. PlasticRoad engineers used FEA to simulate \nphysical forces such as pressure on the road and \nmaterial fatigue to inform engineering decisions.\nAfter building two pilot cycling paths, the company is \nready for larger projects and is in talks with cities and \nmunicipalities to build not only cycle lanes, but also \nroads, parking lots, and schoolyards.
