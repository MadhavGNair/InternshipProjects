{"page_content": " Norconsult and AF Gruppen \nCoastal highway project  \nuses BIM to reduce  \ncarbon\u00a0emissions\nA new Norwegian road authority with an eye on \nemerging technologies and sophisticated BIM \ntechniques tapped Norconsult and AF Gruppen for \nthe design and construction of Route E39, a 15\u2011mile \nstretch of the 680\u2011mile Coastal Highway project. \nThe project aims to eliminate the need for ferries \nand cut travel time in half with fixed connections \nand improved roads between fjords along the route, \nwhich links business regions to housing, labor, and \nservice markets. This $490 million project includes \nfive tunnels, several large interchanges, and bridges, \nincluding Trysfjord Bridge, the world\u2019s largest \nbalanced concrete cantilever bridge of its kind.  Using generative design tools, Revit and Dynamo \nscripts, and the cloud\u2011based Autodesk Forge\u00ae viewer, \nNorconsult was able to federate and visualize data \nacross multiple platforms, reducing materials and \nwaste and improving constructability. The road \nauthority attached an ambitious goal to the project: to \nreduce carbon emissions associated with construction \nby 20%. Detailed parametric design reduced the \namount of concrete needed, enabling a 15% reduction \nof CO2 emissions for the Trysfjord bridge alone. \nLearn more\nReducing \nwaste and GHG \nemissions through \nindustrialized \nconstruction with \nFactory_OS\nLearn moreInspired design and \nconstruction give \nfelled trees a whole \nnew life\nLearn more\nImage courtesy of Norconsult and Baezeni\n18\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
