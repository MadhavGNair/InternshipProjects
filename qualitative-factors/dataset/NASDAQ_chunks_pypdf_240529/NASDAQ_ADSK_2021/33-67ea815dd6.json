{"page_content": "Media &  \nEntertainment\nThe medical illustration team at the Centers for \nDisease Control (CDC) routinely collaborates with \nresearchers and scientists to develop compelling \n3D imagery, animated videos, and motion graphics \nthat convey health risks such as parasites, bacteria, \nviruses, and more. From creating the ubiquitous 3D \nimage of the COVID\u201119 coronavirus to developing an \nanimated hearing loss video  or designing a 3D printed \nmodel of a birth defect, the team leans on a range of \n3D content creation applications, including Autodesk \n3ds Max tools for modeling, animation, and VFX and \nArnold technology for rendering. In designing the \niconic COVID\u201119 coronavirus image, they used 3ds \nMax to make a precise, high\u2011contrast image with \nstrong details and textures to best help the public \nvisualize and understand the invisible threat. Since \nthen, they have animated the virus image, creating a \nversion that rotates. \nImage Courtesy of Alissa Eckert, MSMI; Dan Higgins, MAMSLearn\u00a0how Autodesk is helping \ncustomers respond to COVID\u201119 .\n34\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Health & Resilience\nPartner with customers", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
