{"page_content": "Architecture,  \nEngineering & \nConstruction\nThe buildings sector represents 19% of GHG emissions \nglobally 5 and 38% of energy\u2011 and process\u2011related \nemissions: 28% from operational energy consumption \nand 10% from the production of building materials \nsuch as cement, metal, and glass. 6 \nReducing operational energy consumption in new \nand existing buildings remains a high priority for \nAutodesk and many of our customers. Tackling \nthe embodied carbon of building materials also \noffers great potential for near\u2011term improvement, \nsince those materials will account for about half \nof the climate impacts of projected new building \nconstruction between 2020 and 2050. 7 Reducing \nthe impacts of construction is essential, since that \nindustry consumes more than half of all extracted \nraw materials 8 and generates upwards of 36% \nof the waste stream in the developed West. 9 Up \nto 30% of construction activity on\u2011site is related \nto rework, 10 and as much as 30% of construction \nmaterial is wasted on\u2011site, 11 costing time, money, \nand\u00a0natural\u00a0resources. \nGlobal demographic trends compound the urgency \nof reducing these impacts. As the global population continues to urbanize over the next 30 years, the \nconstruction industry will need to build an average \nof 13,000 buildings every day 12 and 700,000 miles \nof road per year. 13 Industry demand will continue \nto rise for solutions that enable architects, \nengineers, and contractors to support this rapid \ngrowth more sustainably by improving energy and \nmaterials productivity while managing embodied \ncarbon\u00a0thoughtfully. \nOur customers are increasingly working to make \nnet\u2011zero energy buildings, reduce embodied carbon, \nreduce construction waste, and develop smart and \nsustainable cities. Research conducted by Autodesk in \n2020 14 determined that about half of the companies \nsurveyed have dedicated budgets for carbon \nmanagement and/or green building certification \nsolutions, and about 90% of survey respondents \nstated they are likely to invest in carbon management \nin the future. Providing automation tools to support \nthese objectives affordably and at scale is central to \nour sustainability efforts. The Autodesk\u00ae Architecture, \nEngineering & Construction (AEC) Collection and \nAutodesk\u00ae Construction Cloud help enable customers \nto achieve these outcomes. \nOur customers are increasingly \nworking to make net\u2011zero energy \nbuildings, reduce embodied \ncarbon, reduce construction \nwaste, and develop smart and \nsustainable cities. \n5 ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter9.pdf , \nChapter 9: Buildings.\n6 globalabc.org/sites/default/files/inline\u2011files/2020%20Buildings%20\nGSR_FULL%20REPORT.pdf\n7 worldgbc.org/sites/default/files/WorldGBC_Bringing_Embodied_\nCarbon_Upfront.pdf\n8 mdpi.com/2075\u20115309/4/3/266/pdf\n9 ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics\u2011explained/index.php/Waste_\nstatistics#Waste_generation_excluding_major_mineral_wastes\n10 researchgate.net/publication/291000555_Cost_Management_in_\nConstruction_Projects_Rework_and_Its_Effects\n11 sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814753/waste , Chapter 15: \nConstruction Waste.\n12 According to internal research  with market research firm Statista.\n13 Internal research  with Statista.\n14 The six industry sectors targeted in the online carbon management \nsurvey in May 2020 included architecture, MEP, structural \nengineering, civil engineering, construction, and facilities. The survey \ntargeted 450 respondents in the United States, from medium\u2011sized \ncompanies (250 to 4,999 employees), the majority of whom were \ncarbon management decision makers.Total carbon \nWe support customers with tools that tackle the total \ncarbon impacts of the building lifecycle. The Embodied \nCarbon in Construction Calculator (EC3), incubated \nat the Carbon Leadership Forum with input from \nnearly 50 industry partners, helps customers choose \ncarbon\u2011smart materials that have lower embodied \ncarbon. It uses information from publicly available \ndatasheets, enabling building professionals to quickly \ncompare different materials.\u00a0These comparisons can \nnow be done in minutes by general practitioners, \nrather than taking days and whole teams\u00a0as\u00a0in years \npast.\u00a0Project materials data can be transferred directly \nfrom Autodesk\u00ae BIM 360\u00ae with the free, easy\u2011to\u2011use \nEC3 app.\u00a0The materials data available through EC3 \nhas more than doubled since the tool was launched \nin\u00a02019. \u00a0\nTo address carbon associated with building \noperations, Autodesk\u00ae Insight\u00ae (formerly Insight 360) \ntechnology empowers architects and engineers to \ndesign more energy\u2011efficient buildings with advanced \nsimulation engines and building performance \nanalysis data integrated in Revit. By combining Partner with customers\ndesign data in a cloud\u2011based environment, design \nteams can visualize trade\u2011offs with high accuracy. \nThis scalable tool works from early conceptual design \nthrough to build, and is a central place of record for \nbuilding\u00a0energy.\n15\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
