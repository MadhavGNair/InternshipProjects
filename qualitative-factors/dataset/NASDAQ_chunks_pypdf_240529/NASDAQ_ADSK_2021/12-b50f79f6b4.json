Starting in \nfiscal year 2021, we\u00a0partnered\u00a0with \nCDP\u00a0to\u00a0engage\u00a0our suppliers \nand enhance collaboration \nand disclosure on improving \nenvironmental\u00a0measurement \nand\u00a0performance.\u00a0This supports \nour company\u2011wide commitment \nto\u00a0net\u2011zero carbon. Business travel:  We seek to \nreduce the GHG emissions of \nbusiness travel through virtual \nmeetings, partner education, a \ngreen rating system for hotels, \nand\u00a0by incorporating sustainability \nexpectations into our standard \nmeeting contracts. To support \nmore informed decisions, in fiscal \nyear 2021 we started to provide \nemployees with information \nabout GHG emissions when they \npurchase flights through our \nonline booking system. We are also \nworking to decarbonize our fleet \nthrough the use of hybrid leased \nvehicles. Emissions in business \ntravel dropped 80% year over year, \nlargely due to COVID\u201119 travel \nrestrictions. 3 We\u2019re exploring \nopportunities to maintain this \nthrough expanded use of virtual \ncollaboration moving forward.Employee commuting and \nremote work: To account for \nthe impact of remote workers, \nin fiscal year 2021 we included \nGHG emissions associated with \nhome office energy consumption \nin our footprint (as a part of the \nemployee commuting category \nbased on the GHG Protocol) and \npurchased corresponding amounts \nof additional renewable energy  \nand carbon offsets. 3 We plan  \nto continue this practice  \nmoving forward. Major conferences:  Autodesk \nUniversity and One Team \nConference (our annual channel \npartner and sales summit) are \nboth carbon neutral, including \nthe events, attendee travel, and \nGHG emissions related to virtual \nparticipation. 4 We achieve this by \nenhancing efficiency, providing \nvirtual attendance options, \nreducing waste, and purchasing \ncarbon offsets. 3Cloud and data centers: In \naddition to using 100% renewable \nenergy for our cloud services \nand data centers, we strive to \nminimize data center energy use \nthrough server virtualization and \nselection of efficient equipment \nthat meets respected industry \nstandards, and by streamlining \nour code. To further decrease \nenvironmental impact, we plan \nto shift more of our data centers \nfrom Autodesk facilities to cloud \ninfrastructure providers, which \nincreases efficiency due to higher \ninfrastructure capacity utilization. \nThese efforts help us provide \ncustomers with a faster, more \nreliable experience, with reduced \nenvironmental impacts. 3 Our cloud \nservices have been carbon neutral \nsince fiscal year 2016.Facilities: We assess our facilities\u2019 \nenvironmental operating practices \nrelated to energy use and other \nimpact areas, and we work to \ncontinuously review and make \nsustainability improvements. We \nuse our operations as test cases \nto help refine the functionality \nof our solutions, improve our \nenvironmental performance, \nand showcase how customers \ncan use our solutions to meet \ntheir sustainability objectives. \nDue to the pandemic and facility \nshutdowns, emissions in this \ncategory decreased by 25% in \nfiscal year 2021 compared to the \nprior year. Our offices have been \npowered by 100% renewable \nenergy since fiscal year 2016.Procurement \u2011 78%\nBusiness travel \u2011 13%\nEmployee commuting and remote work \u2011 4%\nMajor conferences \u2011 2%\nCloud and data centers \u2011 2%\nFacilities \u2011 1% Total in FY2021  \n126,000 metric \ntons CO2e\nSee detailed performance metrics \nin the Data summary.3 Greenhouse gas emissions from \nbusiness travel are included in Scope \n3: \u201cBusiness travel\u201d and Scope 1 \n(related to fleet business travel).\nEmissions from facilities are included \nin Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3: \n\u201cWaste generated in operations\u201d and \n\u201cLeased assets.\u201d Emissions from data \ncenters are included in Scope 2 (related \nto purchased electricity) and Scope \n3: \u201cPurchased goods and services.\u201d \nEmissions from major conferences are \nincluded in Scope 3: \u201cPurchased goods \nand services.\u201d \n4 Autodesk University has been carbon \nneutral since fiscal year 2016; One Team \nConference since fiscal year 2017.\n13\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials\nImprove our operations", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
