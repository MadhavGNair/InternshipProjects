Sean O\u2019Reilly, Global VP HP Sales & \nInnovation, says, \u201cA project could be developed from concept \ndesign right through to scheduling for manufacturing in \nminutes. The possibilities from the Forge platform, we \nbelieve, are\u00a0endless.\u201d3\u2011Dimensional Services Group \nAutomotive part \ncompany pivots to \nround\u2011the\u2011clock  \nPPE production\nWhen Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia asked \n3\u2011Dimensional Services Group, based in Rochester \nHills, Michigan, to help produce face\u2011shield \nheadbands for health care, workers on the front lines \nof the COVID\u201119 pandemic, the company quickly \npivoted from prototyping chassis and seat\u2011frame \nassemblies to manufacturing personal protective \nequipment (PPE). To expedite the process, the team \nused Autodesk\u00ae PowerMill\u00ae and Moldflow\u00ae software, \nwhich helped them gain flexibility and improve \nautomation, decreasing the time from design to shop \nfloor by as much as 40%. In the first four weeks, \n3\u2011Dimensional manufactured more than 135,000 \nheadbands, with plans underway for 465,000 more \nwith the possibility of doubling those volumes if \nneeded. Employees are working round\u2011the\u2011clock \nshifts, with modifications to keep them safe.\nLearn more Learn moreImage courtesy of 3\u2011Dimensional Services Group\n33\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Health & Resilience", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
