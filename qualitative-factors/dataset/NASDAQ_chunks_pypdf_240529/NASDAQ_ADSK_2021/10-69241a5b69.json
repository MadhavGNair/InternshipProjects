This \nachievement comes on the heels of attaining our \ndecade\u2011long science\u2011based GHG emissions reduction \ntarget the prior year. \nThis year, building on these successes, we\u2019re \ncommitting to two new science\u2011based GHG emissions \nreduction targets: to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG \nemissions by 50% by fiscal year 2031, compared to \nfiscal year 2020, and to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions \nper dollar of gross profit by at least 25%, during \nthe same timeframe. These new targets have been \nmodeled to align with the latest climate science 1.5\u00b0C \npathway. When we launched our first target in fiscal \nyear 2010 and released our methodology, C\u2011FACT, \nunder an open source license, it helped launch the \nscience\u2011based target movement. We are proud to \ncontinue supporting science\u2011based target setting \nwith Science Based Targets initiative to make this a \ncommon practice across\u00a0industries.Driving net\u2011zero \ncarbon emissions\n50 %\n25%Commitments Targets\nNet\u2011zero  \ncarbonemissions for Scopes 1, 2, \nand 3 annually, beginning \nfiscal year 2021\nACHIEVED IN FY2021 (AND ONGOING)\nrenewable energy100 %powering our facilities, cloud \nservices, and employee work \nfrom home by fiscal year 2021\nreduction in Scope 1 and \nScope 2 GHG emissions by \nfiscal year 2031, compared \nto fiscal year 2020\nminimum reduction in  \nScope\u00a03 GHG emissions per \ndollar of gross profit by fiscal \nyear 2031, compared to fiscal \nyear\u00a02020ACHIEVED IN FY2021 (AND ONGOING)\nIN PROGRESS\nIN PROGRESSThe following commitments and targets demonstrate our broad and bold approach in this area.  \nOur Environmental Policy  underpins the company\u2019s efforts in our own operations and with our  \nproducts and services.\nSee Autodesk FY2021 Annual Report. \nLearn more\nLearn more\n11\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials\nImprove our operations", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
