In addition to \nreducing GHG emissions, these projects deliver \npositive outcomes in alignment with our broader \nimpact opportunity areas.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we offset 126,000 metric \ntons of CO2e through the below projects, ensuring \nnet\u2011zero GHG emissions across our business and \nvalue chain, while delivering positive co\u2011benefits.14Trees\nSustainable building in Malawi\nThe DURABRIC\u2122 Programme by 14Trees \npromotes the manufacture, distribution, \nand use of stabilized soil bricks that do not \nrequire firing and reduce the use of wood for \nfuel. This alleviates deforestation, protects \nbiodiversity, and reduces GHG emissions. \nThe bricks are made using just earth, sand, \ncement, and water. By providing on\u2011site \ntraining, the project helps ensure local \nmanufacturers and builders learn new skills \nto adopt the new technology.\nAqua Clara brings affordable water filters to \ncommunities in Kenya, eliminating the need to \nboil water before drinking. The filters provide \nsafe water, improving health and saving \nlives, as well as cutting carbon emissions and \nprotecting local forests.\nThis program identifies and rehabilitates \nwater boreholes in sub\u2011Saharan Africa that \nhave fallen into disrepair through lack of \nparts or expertise, and provides ongoing \nmaintenance to ensure a consistent and \nhigh\u2011quality water supply. This removes the \nneed to boil water to make it safe, reducing \nwood and charcoal use and improving health, \nlivelihoods, and the environment.An Autodesk Foundation customer, Burn \nJikokoa\u2122 stoves dramatically reduce \ntoxic smoke exposure in the home, \nsaving lives, cutting CO2 emissions, and \nreducing household expenses. The stoves \nare manufactured in a state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art \nsolar\u2011powered factory in Nairobi that \ndirectly employs more than 100 people and \noffers equal opportunities to women in a \ntraditionally male industry.\nThis project conserves the forested areas of \nthe Gola Rainforest National Park, a global \nbiodiversity hotspot in Sierra Leone. The \nconservation of 68,500 hectares of tropical \nforest protects threatened and endangered \nspecies and works to improve livelihoods \nof impoverished communities living in and \naround the forest.The International Small Group and Tree \nPlanting Program creates long\u2011term income \nand sustainable growth for local communities, \nproviding education and skills training to \nsubsistence farmers to plant trees on their \nland. The farmers retain ownership of the \ntrees and their products and receive a share of \ncarbon\u2011related revenues from the developer. \nThe project distributes GPS\u2011enabled handheld \ndevices to each small group, enabling the \ncreation of a real\u2011time database of trees \nplanted and their monitoring.Please see our most recent CDP Climate Change  \ndisclosure  for more detail about governance, strategy, \nrisk management, and performance in this area. \n14\nAUTODESK FY21 IMPACT REPORTOverview Energy & Materials Health & Resilience Work & Prosperity Governance Appendix \n Energy & Materials", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2021.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
