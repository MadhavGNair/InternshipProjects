Our regional offices \nare empowered to provide additional opportunities for groups of employees \nto give back at a local level. In this section, we have highlighted a few of our \nglobal efforts.\nHABITAT FOR HUMANITY\nSince 2013, ACI\u2019s Habitat for Humanity program has grown from nine U.S.-based \nlocations to nearly 20 ACI locations in eight countries, with more than 400 \nACI volunteers participating in home-build events in 2018 alone.  \nCODING FOR GIRLS  \nACI employees in Naples, Florida; Omaha, Nebraska; and Watford, U.K., have \nhosted several Coding for Girls day-camps and introduced hundreds of middle \nschool-aged girls to the world of technology and payments. Our teams have \ndeveloped content and facilitate workshops and lead lectures and discussions \nthroughout the events. Similarly, ACI employees in Cape Town, South Africa, \nhost a more in-depth four-day IT workshop for approximately 20 local high \nschool students to provide students with a glimpse of what it\u2019s like to work for \na leading global payments company.\nWOMEN IN PAYMENTS\nACI is a global sponsor of Women in Payments (WIP) and supports the organization\u2019s \ndrive to connect and empower women striving for gender parity across  \nthe payments ecosystem.
