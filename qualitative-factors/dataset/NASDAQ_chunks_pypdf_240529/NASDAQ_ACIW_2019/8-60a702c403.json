{"page_content": "9\nENERGY IMPROVEMENTS ARE  \nMAKING AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT\nEfficient energy use is important to ACI and our customers as it impacts our business costs \nas well as our carbon footprint. We recently began tracking electricity usage in our data \ncenters and will analyze this data to see how we can be more efficient. As conservation is \na management priority, we have already made important steps to improve efficiency and \nexpect to provide more details on our progress in future disclosures.\n1/2  LIGHTING ELECTRICAL LOAD\nACI recently converted its U.S. and Indian offices from fluorescent  \nand T-8/T-12 to LED lighting. The switch to LED lighting has already  \nproduced positive energy savings and will continue to do so in the future. \nBy converting to LED lighting, ACI cut its lighting electrical load roughly  \nin half, producing $30,0002 in estimated annual energy savings.\nLOWER  HVAC ENERGY COSTS\nACI utilizes building management systems to control HVAC where possible. \nWe have limited the usage of air conditioning, depending on the occupancy \nof a particular office area. These efforts resulted in both decreased energy \nconsumption and lower energy costs. HVAC efficiency initiatives in our  \nPune, India office alone resulted in annual energy savings of approximately \n$27,000 USD.\nABOUT ACI CEO LETTER SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTCLIMATE RESILIENCY STRATEGY\nACI Worldwide has data centers dispersed globally that help mitigate risks \nsuch as those associated with natural disasters. Our infrastructure is positioned \noperationally to minimize concentration risk.\n2 Based on approximately $0.03 of energy savings per square feet", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACIW_2019.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
