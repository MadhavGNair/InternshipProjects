{"page_content": "67\n\u00a9 2021 Maxeon Solar TechnologiesSpotlight: Power to Spare \u2013 How Our Solar Panels Contribute  \nto Energy-Positive BuildingsGOVERNANCE\nIn Trondheim, Norway, a sleek office building currently generates twice as much solar energy \nas it will ever use. This is not an error but an intentional engineering solution to aid in the \ndevelopment of an energy-positive building. As the term \"energy-positive\" suggests, the \nPowerhouse Bratt\u00f8rkaia will produce enough energy to offset all its own energy use as well \nas energy consumed through the production of building materials used in the construction, \noperation and disposal of the building.\nThe SunPower Maxeon solar panels installed on the roof of the iconic building offset hidden \nenergy costs embedded in the building's construction and eventual demolition over a lifetime \nof 60 years. The solar system is also considered unique in its design. Instead of a flat, wide \nroof, the building's roof slopes steeply to take full advantage of the sun's position in the \nNorthern Hemisphere. \nA total of 1,157 SunPower Maxeon solar panels cover the roof, producing, on average, \n358\u00a0MWh of energy annually. Even in the northernmost reaches of Europe where winter days \nare only four hours long, the Powerhouse generates valuable solar energy through Maxeon\u2019s \nhigh efficiency solar panels. In the summer, when daylight hours stretch to 20 hours per day, \nexcess energy is exported to the power grid.\nPowerhouse Bratt\u00f8rkaia is a striking example of what climate-friendly office spaces \ncould look like in the not-too-distant future: inspiring, resilient, and 100%  \nenergy-positive.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2020.pdf", "page": 66, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
