We leverage our in-depth knowledge \nof solar cell and solar panel construction to push the boundaries of \nmodule efficiency without compromising reliability or performance. \nHigh-efficiency modules use less raw materials like metal, plastic, and \nglass for every watt-hour of energy produced as well as secondary \nimpacts such as savings in transportation emissions. \nOther areas of module improvements involve working with industry \nleading suppliers on minimising the size of our junction boxes and \nplacing them optimally on the module which reduces the volume of \nplastics used in the housing, cables, connectors and potting material. \nMaxeon is uniquely positioned to innovate relentlessly in sustainability \nand efficiency programmes that minimise our impact up and down the \nsolar supply chain.Our Initiatives: Enabling and Supporting \nour Customers\u2019 Clean Energy Journey\nAs Maxeon builds on a legacy of 35 years of pushing \nthe boundaries of innovation, we continue to provide \nproducts that are more powerful, reliable and durable \nthan any other panel on the global market.
