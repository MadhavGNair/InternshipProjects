We invite our customers to share their feedback on both our products and our \npartners in three ways:\n \u2022Installation Experience Survey  \u2013 One month after the installation is completed, we conduct \na customer survey to ask how likely a customer is to recommend their Maxeon installation \npartner to friends and family. Additionally, we ask for feedback on the customer experience \nprovided by the partner throughout the entire installation process (e.g., meeting \ncommitments, responsiveness, system design, installation phase).\n \u2022One-Year System Experience Survey  \u2013 On the first anniversary of a customer\u2019s system \ninstallation, we send a second survey to ask how likely the customer is to recommend our \nproducts and to what extent the installation met the customer\u2019s expectations.\n \u2022Issue-To-Resolution  \u2013 Our customers are always able to contact us with questions or \nconcerns. After a customer's query has been resolved, a survey is sent to the customer to \nevaluate their\u00a0experience.\nOur NPS for Customer Health is a combination of all the responses from the three \nsurveys\u00a0above.\n20\n0\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020406080\n76\n54\nPartner Health\nCustomer Health", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2020.pdf", "page": 82, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
