Conflict minerals include: columbite-\ntantalite (coltan) (i.e., tantalum), cassiterite (i.e., tin), gold, wolframite (i.e., \ntungsten) or their derivatives (3TG), and could expand to include other \nminerals or their derivatives. \nTo support this policy, Maxeon has committed to seven key principles  \n(see graphic). \nSuppliers identified as having a reasonable risk that they are sourcing \nfrom or linked to any party providing direct or indirect support to, non-\nstate armed groups, will immediately undergo detailed investigations \nby Maxeon. Should any breaches to the Conflict Minerals Policy \narise, remediation measures will be undertaken which can include \nsuspension or discontinuation of the engagement.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2020.pdf", "page": 51, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
