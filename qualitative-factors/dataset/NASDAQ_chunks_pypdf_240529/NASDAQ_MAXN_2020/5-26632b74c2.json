At Maxeon Solar Technologies, we also believe that in fighting climate change, we have a responsibility to our \nfuture generations to do so in a sustainable way. \nSustainability is a journey. And to begin our journey at Maxeon, we have bolstered our internal and external resources to champion \nESG alongside our passionate employees and have leveraged the best corporate sustainability practices to formulate our strategy \nand identify the issues we can contribute to most. \nIn establishing our programme and to support progress towards achieving the principles that comprise our commitment as a United \nNations Global Compact Signatory, we conducted a prioritisation exercise to identify the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \nwhere we can scale the most impact in our business. We challenged ourselves to adopt goals that expand beyond our primary \nbusiness of providing access to renewable energy around the globe. As a result, we have committed to four SDGs (see right).\nAs the Executive Leader of our newly established Global ESG team, I know that our company will be much more effective in achieving \nour goals with the collective engagement across our organisation.
