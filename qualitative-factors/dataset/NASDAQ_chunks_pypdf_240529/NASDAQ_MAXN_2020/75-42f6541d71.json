Our panels undergo \nextensive testing to ensure confidence in \nmanufacturing quality, product performance \nand reliability over time. All our products are \ncertified using internationally recognised third-\nparty certification bodies, before shipping to \nour\u00a0customers. \nInternally we perform regular outgoing reliability assessments to \nvalidate the performance of our panels prior to shipment. These \nreliability assessments are based on methodologies defined in our \nReliability Monitoring programme. \nBeyond the production of high-quality panels, we further control any \nchanges through a rigorous change management process in which \ncriteria are set forth to assess the impact of any change impacting form, \nfit or function. Maxeon\u2019s iQuality system is customised to facilitate and \nretain various quality and reliability information to actively \ndemonstrate our emphasis on data integrity and\u00a0transparency.\nWe also ensure that we undertake stakeholder engagement in \nthe quality, reliability and safety of our panels, which assists us \nin enhancing our processes for greater efficiencies. Engagement \nof employees on the shopfloor allows for the insight of differing \nperspectives.
