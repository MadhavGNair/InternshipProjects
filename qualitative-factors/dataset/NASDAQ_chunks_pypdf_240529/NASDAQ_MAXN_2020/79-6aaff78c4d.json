We want our \nrecord-setting projects to demonstrate how solar is actually a technology \nthat everyone can utilise in their daily lives.\u201d \nRapha\u00ebl Domjan, SolarStratos Founder and Pilot\nClick  here  to find out more.SUCCESS STORY\nLightyear One\nElectric cars are considered the most \nenergy efficient of all vehicles today. All \nwith a design aesthetic as clean as the \nenergy it\u00a0produces. \nLightyear One, a fully functioning \nprototype uses SunPower Maxeon \nsolar cells. Our innovative copper \nfoundation gives each cell far \nmore strength and flexibility than \nconventional ones, wrapping beautifully \naround Lightyear One\u2019s sweeping \ncontours without cracking.\nRecent testing showed that it can travel up to 725 km without a recharge \u2014 a \ndistance no other commercially available EV can touch.\n\u201cThe car actually is based on the fact that we had to fit five square metres of \nsolar panels onto it, and all the rest is designed around it.\u201d \nRocco Carrieri, Senior Designer for Lightyear partner Granstudio.\nClick here  to find out more.\nGOVERNANCE\nSustainable Innovation ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2020.pdf", "page": 79, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
