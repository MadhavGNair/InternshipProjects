From a design perspective, our solar panels have an estimated \nproduct lifetime of approximately 40 years and beyond, with a combined product and performance warranty \nof 25 years. In our operations, Maxeon aims to play a key role in the circular economy, by establishing \nsustainable facilities for solar cell and panel production.\nWe also support our customers in their recycling efforts by working \nwith local recycling experts in the countries where we operate. These \norganisations include PV Cycle in Europe, Reclaim PV Recycling and \nHamada Corporation in Asia Pacific, and Recycle PV Solar and SEIA in  \nthe United States.\nIn order to support end-of-life recycling, we work to maintain our \nachievement as Cradle to Cradle Certified, our commitment to Zero \nWaste-to-Landfill and to fulfil the responsibilities of our Declare Label. Circular Economy ENVIRONMENTAL\n\u201cBuilding on our past \nsustainability initiatives and \nenvironmental certifications, \napplying circularity is a natural \nevolution which goes hand-\nin-hand with reducing our \nemissions and material usage.\u201d\nPeter Aschenbrenner\nChief Strategy Officer", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2020.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
