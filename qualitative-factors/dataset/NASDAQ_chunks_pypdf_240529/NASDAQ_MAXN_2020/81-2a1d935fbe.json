Customers \nwho give a rating of 9 or 10 are called Promoters \n\u2013 they are most likely to promote or recommend a \ncompany\u2019s products or services. Ratings of 8 and 7, \nreferred to as Passives, represent customers who are \nsatisfied, but not particularly inclined to promote your company.  \nA rating of 6 and below is considered a Detractor, since the \nrespondents are not fully satisfied with the service offered and may \nshare their negative experience with others. The NPS is calculated \nby subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage \nof Promoters. Scores above 0 are considered good and those \nabove\u00a050\u00a0are excellent. \u201cListening to our customers \nand understanding their \nexpectations and needs are \ncritical to enable them to fulfil \ntheir clean energy objectives.\u201d \nMark Babcock\nChief Revenue Officer", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2020.pdf", "page": 81, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
