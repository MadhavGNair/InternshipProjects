This certification \nstipulates that less than 1% of \nwaste materials can be sent to \na landfill and less than 10% of \nwaste materials can be sent to \na waste-to-energy facility, as \nverified through an external \naudit process managed by NSF International, an independent \norganisation that oversees the Landfill-Free standard for companies \naround the world. (Learn more at\u00a0 nsf.org .)\nTo achieve this certification, we adopted a lifecycle focused \napproach across our supply chain. At the primary stages of our \nsupply chain, we focused on acquiring downstream waste vendors \nthrough a stringent selection process to reduce our waste in the \ninitial stages of sourcing. We also implemented a range of waste \nreduction procedures during the manufacturing process, including \nthe segregation of waste.To continuously achieve our waste \ntargets, we recycle on-site food waste \ninto an organic composting garden \npowered by solar. \n \u2022Step 1: Site generates 950 pounds/\nday of organic waste   \n \u2022Step 2: Collect organic waste for \ngarden irrigation through a recycling \nmachine that converts food scraps \ninto soil conditioners for the plant\u2019s \non-site\u00a0farm\n \u2022Step 3: Garden grows produce which \nis then consumed in the staff\u00a0canteen\n \u2022Step 4: Garden is used as a learning \narea for employees to apply the \nknowledge to their homes\nOverall, we were able to generate 2,580 kg of compost in 2020 used \nas organic fertiliser for the gardens in our Mexicali facility.CASE STUDY\nZero Waste-to-Landfill Certification \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2020.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
