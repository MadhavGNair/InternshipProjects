{"page_content": "9V3 Energy Recovery\nLZ Series\nProvide energy efficient 100% outside air ventilation, while being easy to install because of a compact footprint, and \neasy to maintain because of large service access. Available from 450 to 10,000 cfm with overlapping cabinet sizes for \napplication flexibility, the high performance V3 Series with energy recovery wheel includes high efficiency variable \nspeed ECM driven direct drive backward curve plenum supply and exhaust fans, and double wall rigid polyurethane \nfoam injected panel construction with lockable-hinged service access doors. These features make AAON HVAC units \nmore energy efficient; thereby consuming less energy.\nEngineered to maximize the efficiency of the complete hydronic system. A walk-in  \nservice access vestibule allows the complete hydronic system with pumping package to be  \nserviced in the outdoor mechanical room.  Available from 45-540 tons, the high  \nperformance chiller is available with VFD controlled variable speed scroll compressors \nor Turbocor variable capacity oil-free magnetic bearing centrifugal compressors. Factory  \ninstalled 98% efficiency boilers with pumping packages are available for applications that \nrequire a hot water system. Energy saving waterside economizers are available for chilled \nwater systems that require cooling at low ambient conditions.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAON_2019.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
