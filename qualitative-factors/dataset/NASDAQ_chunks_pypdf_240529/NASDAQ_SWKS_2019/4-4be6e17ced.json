In 2018, Skyworks made a three-year purchase \nof U.S.-based Energy Credit totaling more than 93 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of clean \nelectricity. This annual offset of 31 million kWh means Skyworks sourced approximately \n51% of the energy for its U.S. manufacturing facilities from clean-energy sources. \nSustainability Policy\nSince becoming ISO 14001 certified in 2002, Skyworks has operated according to \nestablished policies. In 2012 our Environmental Policy expanded to become what is \nnow our global Sustainability Policy. We believe in fostering awareness of the policy \nto promote sustainable business practices in all that we do. In 2019, we continued our \npractice of distributing the Sustainability Policy to all employees globally, in their local \nlanguage, in an ID-badge format. Worn daily, these badges serve as a constant reminder \nthat operating sustainably is everyone's responsibility.\nAnnual Reports\nIn March 2019, Skyworks for the first time distributed its 2019 Proxy Statement and 2018 \nAnnual Report to its stockholders utilizing the \u201cnotice and access\u201d format, by which the \nmajority of stockholders are notified that such materials are available electronically. \nThis implementation significantly reduced the environmental impact of our annual \ndistribution of proxy materials, eliminating the printing of almost 70,000 printed \nreports\u2014equivalent to more than 31,000 pounds of paper\u2014an 87% overall reduction.\n2018 Annual Report\nNotice of 2019 Annual Meeting\nand Proxy Statement\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SWKS_2019.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
