We want to empower our employees to \ntake charge of their development while having their \nmanagers guide them on growth opportunities for \ntheir current role and what\u2019s next. As we move to a \nwork from anywhere workplace, it expands the career \nopportunities for our employees since roles are no \nlonger defined by location. This enables more career \ngrowth through internal mobility and movement \nthrough teams and different areas of the business.\nA key piece in development is cultivating a learning \nculture where learning is a habit, and learning agility \nis at the forefront. This means creating the right \nlearning resources for our employees for their current \nand future roles. As we look to empower and develop \nour distributed workforce, we have transitioned all of \nour training to be virtual and improved the \nfunctionality of Zillow University, our online training \nportal. Zillow employees have completed nearly \n90,000 hours of content in the past year on Zillow \nUniversity and LinkedIn Learning.\u00a0 We will continue to \nfind new ways of enhancing the learning experience \nfor our employees through new modalities, tools, and \ntechnology. In addition, all Zillow employees continue \nto participate in our annual review process, where \nthey discuss their performance over the last year and \nfocus on their individual growth plans. Zillow Internships\nSince 2016, Zillow has offered summer internships \nto college students just starting their careers in tech. \nZillow interns are paired with a manager and a \nmentor to support their learnings throughout the \nsummer and work with small teams on real-life \nbusiness-critical projects that are expected to have \nan impact on the company's bottom line. In 2020, \nZillow hosted a cohort of 105 interns as our first \ncompletely virtual intern class.\nLeadership at Zillow\nOur 1,500 plus people-managers play a critical role  \nin moving our business forward by coaching their \nteam, developing their talent and providing strong \ncommunication to create team engagement.
