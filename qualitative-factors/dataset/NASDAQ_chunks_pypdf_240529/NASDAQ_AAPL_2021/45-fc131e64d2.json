{"page_content": "In January 2021, we announced two financial \ncommitments to support Black and Brown \nentrepreneurs. We are investing $10 million in \nHarlem Capital, an early-stage venture capital firm \nbased in New York with a mission to support 1000 \ndiverse founders over the next 20 years. And Apple \nis investing $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank\u2019s \nClear Vision Impact Fund, increasing loan capital \nfor small- and medium-sized minority-owned \nbusinesses and\u00a0underserved communities. \nIn May 2021, building on these two commitments, \nwe supported VamosVentures, a Latinx-owned \nfund investing in technology-enabled companies \nled by Latinx and diverse founders, and Collab \nCapital, which aims to decrease the racial wealth \ngap by helping Black-founded businesses \novercome the funding and network challenges  \nthat often stifle their growth.\nTo ensure that our work to protect the planet \nalso enhances equity, we launched an Impact \nAccelerator for Black- and Brown-owned \nbusinesses.

We \nwork hard to ensure our resources are used to \nuplift communities around the world, creating \nopportunities for educators and students to \ngain\u00a0coding skills and unlock creativity. \nCommunity Education Initiative \nInspired by the impact of our ConnectED initiative  \nand programs like Everyone Can Create and \nEveryone Can Code, we launched CEI in 2019 with \na focus on expanding learning opportunities in \ncommunities that are traditionally underrepresented \nand under-resourced in technology. Through \neducational partnerships across the U.S., we\u2019ve \nbeen able to reach tens of thousands of students \nand educators who might not have had access to \nour technology and education tools.CEI partners with K\u201312 and higher education \ninstitutions, community-based organizations, and \nnonprofits to bring coding, creativity, and workforce \ndevelopment opportunities to educators and \nlearners of all ages. CEI aims to build knowledge \nand skills for high-demand, high-growth technical \ncareers alongside communities of color to advance \neducational equity. Our support includes hardware \ngrants, monetary grants to support scholarships \nand programming, resources for educator \ntraining, curriculum development, and employee \nengagement opportunities. \nAfter starting with 10 communities in 2019, we are \nnow working in dozens of locations around the \nU.S.\u2014including with 36 HBCUs\u2014to create more \ncoding, creativity, and other learning opportunities. \nGrounded in the positive relationships that we have \ncreated, we are working to deepen our impact in \nthree areas:\n\u2022 Educator development:  We\u2019re providing \neducator development and training opportunities \nto build the knowledge and skills educators \nneed to teach coding in underrepresented \ncommunities through Teacher Coding \nAcademies and the CEI Learning Series, in \nwhich hundreds of teachers from around the \nU.S. can meet virtually to share best practices \non remote learning. Through our Academies \nand CEI Learning Series, we are connecting CEI \neducators with Apple Distinguished Educators \nfrom all around the world. Apple Distinguished \nEducators lead and participate in learning \nworkshops, along with our Apple Professional \nLearning Specialists.\n\u2022 Partnerships:  We\u2019re partnering with \nnonprofits, NGOs, and community-based \norganizations that provide out-of-school-time \nlearning\u00a0experiences.\n\u2022 Supporting minority-serving institutions:   \nWe\u2019re especially focused on expanding our \nengagement with minority-serving institutions, \nincluding HBCUs, HSIs, and tribal colleges and \nuniversities, as well as community colleges and \npublic schools in underserved communities. \nRead more about how we \ndesign our products to \nsupport education  (p29).Introduction Our Business Appendix Our People Suppliers Customers Environment Apple\u2019s 2021 ESG Report   46 Communities", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2021.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
