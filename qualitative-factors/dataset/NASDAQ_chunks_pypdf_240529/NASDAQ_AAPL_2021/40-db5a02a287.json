We\u2019re also working \nto increase the impact of these programs by \nhelping expand the capabilities of\u00a0teachers at \nlocal vocational schools.\u2022 The Automation Technician program  teaches \nstudents to install, maintain, and repair \nautomation machines in the production line, \nwhile the Line Leader program  helps students \ncultivate skills needed to advance into production \nline supervisor roles.

We\u2019ve expanded this program \nso students can also learn from Creatives at \nour Apple Store locations to become more \nfamiliar with the functionality of Apple products \nand\u00a0services, and gain insight into Apple\u2019s \ndeveloper systems as they continue to advance \nin their coding coursework.\n\u2022 Health and wellness: We provide programs that \nempower supplier employees to take charge of \ntheir own personal health and well-being. Our \nhealth education program started in 2017 in China \nas a peer-to-peer program providing training \non reproductive health, disease prevention, and \nnutrition.
