{"page_content": "At Apple, we are optimistic about technology\u2019s awesome potential for good. \nBut we know that it won\u2019t happen on its own. Every day, we work to infuse \nthe products and services we make with decency and humanity. And we \nstrive to build the best products on earth while leaving the world better \nthan\u00a0we found it.\nLiving up to that commitment means staying true to the values that have defined Apple from the \nbeginning. It means innovating to protect people\u2019s privacy, which we believe is a fundamental human \nright. It means creating technology that is accessible for all people. It means building a company culture \nthat is inclusive and a team that represents the diversity of our world. It means treating our colleagues, \ncustomers, and supply chain partners with dignity and respect, and protecting the planet we all share.\nIn all this, we\u2019re mindful that global challenges like climate change must be tackled not just by \ngovernments but by innovative companies. We are proud to be carbon neutral today, and we\u2019ve \nset\u00a0an\u00a0ambitious goal to make our entire worldwide supply chain and the use of our products carbon \nneutral by 2030. We\u2019re also partnering with nonprofit and community leaders to help students access \na\u00a0quality education and learn vital skills like coding, to break down systemic barriers to opportunity \nin\u00a0our economy, and to invest in the next generation of diverse entrepreneurs and problem-solvers.\nThis report comes in the wake of a year defined by the COVID-19 pandemic, and from its earliest \ndays,\u00a0the first question we asked ourselves was, \u201chow can we help?\u201d We met an urgent call to action \nby working with our partners to source millions of masks, designing and manufacturing millions of face \nshields, and supporting medical workers and first responders however we could. No period has taught \nus more about protecting each other\u2019s health, and we plan to carry the lessons we\u2019re learning with us \nlong into the future.\nAt Apple, we are pushing this work forward every day, and we\u2019re deeply committed to measuring our \nefforts and improving upon them\u2014day by day and year by year. We do so in the belief that at its best, \ntechnology can empower people, enrich their lives, and help everyone participate in the always-urgent \nwork of building a better world.\nTim Cook  \nCEO\nOur Business Appendix Our People Suppliers Customers Communities Environment Apple\u2019s 2021 ESG Report   3 Introduction ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2021.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
