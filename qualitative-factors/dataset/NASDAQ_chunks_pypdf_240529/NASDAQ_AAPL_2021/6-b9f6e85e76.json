The Office \nof Environment, Policy \nand Social Initiatives \nworks with teams across \nApple to set strategy, \nengage stakeholders, \nand\u00a0communicate progress. \nOur integrated approach \nmeans that decisions \nabout Apple\u2019s values, \nincluding environment, \nare\u00a0reviewed and supported \nat the highest levels of \nthe\u00a0company.We are committed to creating products that enrich the lives of our customers \nin a way that protects the earth\u2019s resources that we all share. In 2018, we \nreached our goal of sourcing all electricity for our stores, data centers, and \noffices from renewable sources. Then in 2020, Apple became carbon neutral \nfor our worldwide operations, including business travel and employee commute. \nWe\u00a0are\u00a0now tackling the remainder of our footprint with an ambitious goal to \nmake our products carbon neutral by 2030\u2014from our supply chain to the \nenergy\u00a0customers use to power our devices.  \nOur strategy focuses on three interconnected areas: climate change, resources, \nand smarter chemistry. Our comprehensive carbon footprint informs the work \nwe\u00a0do to reduce our emissions, including our roadmap to carbon neutrality. \nWithin\u00a0our resources pillar, we\u2019re working to make our products using only \nrecycled and renewable materials and eliminate plastic from our packaging.  \nAnd we are committed to using safer materials to create better products \nfor\u00a0those who design, make, use, and recycle them. All the work we do aims \nto improve environmental health, not just for our customers, suppliers, and \nemployees, but also\u00a0for broader global communities. \nClimate change\nAs climate change increasingly threatens \nbiodiversity and puts people\u2019s access to clean \nair,\u00a0adequate food, safe drinking water, and homes \nat risk, we believe we have a responsibility to take \nurgent and decisive action. \nSince April 2020, Apple has been carbon neutral \nacross all of our corporate emissions, including our \nstores, data centers, and corporate facilities, as \nwell as business travel and employee commuting. \nWe started by investing in clean energy around the \nworld. Since 2018, Apple has sourced 100 percent \nof its corporate and retail electricity from \n100 percent renewable sources.\nIn 2020, we unveiled an ambitious plan to achieve \ncarbon neutrality for our entire carbon footprint, \nincluding our products, by 2030. We plan to reach \nthis goal by reducing our emissions by 75 percent \ncompared to 2015,1 and by investing in carbon \nremoval solutions for the remaining emissions.Our 10-year climate roadmap will address Apple\u2019s \ncarbon footprint through the following five pillars:\n\u2022 Low-carbon design:  We\u2019re making products \nwith more recycled materials and working to \nreduce the amount of energy our devices use.\n\u2022 Energy efficiency:  We\u2019re using energy more \nefficiently across retail stores, offices, data \ncenters, and manufacturing sites.\n\u2022 Renewable electricity: We\u2019re committed to \ntransitioning our entire manufacturing supply \nchain to 100 percent renewable electricity \ngenerated from solar, wind, and other \nrenewable\u00a0projects.\n\u2022 Direct emissions abatement:  We\u2019re innovating \nand improving the processes in our facilities \nand\u00a0supply chain to\u00a0reduce greenhouse  \ngas emissions.\n\u2022 Carbon removal:  We\u2019re investing in working \nforests and ecosystem restoration in ways that \nrespect communities and remove carbon from \nthe atmosphere.We\u2019re leveraging the funds \nfrom Apple\u2019s \u20ac2 billion \n(about $2.2 billion) bond \nissuance in 2019 to help \nmeet our climate neutrality \ngoal.

To date, Apple \nhas issued about $4.7 billion \nin green bonds.\nRead more about our \nenvironmental efforts in \nour 2021 Environmental \nProgress Report , including \ninformation about Apple\u2019s \nrenewable energy  projects .Introduction Our Business Appendix Our People Suppliers Customers Communities Apple\u2019s 2021 ESG Report   7 Environment", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2021.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
