We focus on three main areas: \n\u2022 Materials:  Transition to only recycled or \nrenewable materials in our products and \npackaging, and maximize material efficiency, \nproduct longevity, and recovery. \n\u2022 Water stewardship:  Reduce freshwater use, \ntransition to alternative sources, improve the \nquality of the water we discharge, and protect \nshared water resources. \n\u2022 Zero waste to landfill:  Minimize overall waste \ngenerated and eliminate waste sent to landfill \nfrom key manufacturing facilities, corporate \noffices, data centers, and retail stores.\nMaterials\nWe\u2019re using three different levers to reduce \nour footprint and achieve circularity: sourcing \nand efficiency; product longevity; and product \nend-of-life.Sourcing and efficiency\nOur goal is to use only recycled and renewable \nmaterials in our products and packaging, and \nto use these materials more efficiently. And we \nsource materials responsibly, whether from virgin, \nrecycled, or renewable sources. In fiscal year \n2020, we released seven products with more than \n20\u00a0percent recycled content. The MacBook Air \nwith Retina display (2020) contains 40 percent \nof material from recycled sources, including \n100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure. \nAnd in October 2020, we introduced iPhone 12 \nand iPhone 12 Pro, the first Apple products made \nwith 99 percent recycled tungsten and 98 percent \nrecycled rare earth elements.\nProduct longevity\nWe want to make the most of the materials we \nuse through designing long-lasting products. \nWe design durable hardware, leverage software \nupdates to extend functionality, provide convenient \naccess to repair services, refurbish devices for \ntheir next user, and reuse parts that still have \nmore\u00a0to give.Carbon removal\nTo address the emissions we can\u2019t avoid, we need \nto take active steps to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) \nfrom the atmosphere. We invest in nature-based \nsolutions that protect and restore forests, wetlands, \nand grasslands, which store carbon drawn from \nthe atmosphere. Partnering with Conservation \nInternational and Goldman Sachs, Apple will invest \nup to $200 million through the Restore Fund, which \naims to remove more than 1 million metric tons of \nCO 2 per year in its pilot phase. The Restore Fund \nwill align with international standards to ensure that \nthe carbon stored in forests is being conservatively \nand accurately quantified and is permanently \nlocked out of the atmosphere. We are also closely \nengaging with local and indigenous communities to \nrespect and protect their rights and livelihoods. Climate scenario analysis\nLooking to the future, we conducted a climate \nscenario analysis to better understand the potential \neffects of climate change on Apple\u2019s business. \nTo align with the Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, \nwe considered a range of scenarios, including one \nwell below 2\u00b0 Celsius. The analysis highlighted how \nour renewable energy program, carbon neutrality \ngoals, and emissions reduction target aligned \nwith the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) \ncould improve our resiliency to the impacts of \nclimate change.10.4M\ndevices refurbished for new \nusers in fiscal year 2020.6 Introduction Our Business Appendix Our People Suppliers Customers Communities Apple\u2019s 2021 ESG Report   10 Environment", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2021.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
