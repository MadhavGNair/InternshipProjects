Apple supports these initiatives \nthrough strategic investments as well as donations \nto nonprofit partners.\nRacial Equity and Justice Initiative \nWe have an urgent responsibility to help dismantle \nsystemic racism and support opportunities for \ncommunities of color. Our Racial Equity and \nJustice Initiative  (REJI), launched in June 2020 \nand beginning in the United States, focuses on \ncreating lasting change in three areas: expanding \naccess to education, supporting criminal justice \nreform, and removing economic barriers for \nBlack and Brown communities. Starting with a \n$100 million commitment, this initiative has spurred \nnew partnerships and projects while inspiring us \nto\u00a0weave a focus on equity and justice into  \neverything we do. \nAccess to education\nREJI builds on our long-standing commitment \nto education. We\u2019re partnering with schools in \nunder-resourced communities to enrich their \nscience, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) \nprograms, and to support educators and learners \nwith Apple technology, curriculum, and hands-on \nprofessional learning. To deepen our engagement \nwith historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the U.S., Apple helped launch the Propel \nCenter, a global innovation and learning hub in \nAtlanta, Georgia, that offers innovation curricula, \ntechnology support, career opportunities, and \nfellowship programs. In addition, we are deepening \nand expanding our work with new innovation grants \nfor HBCU engineering programs, a Fellows program \nfor educators, and academic scholarships.\nCriminal justice reform\nWe support organizations that continue to \nchallenge a justice system that disproportionately \nfails Black and Brown people. These include the \nEqual Justice Initiative, Leadership Conference \nEducation Fund, the King Center, and the \nBirmingham Civil Rights Institute.\nEconomic equality\nBlack founders and developers in the technology \nsector face systemic barriers, especially when \nstarting and leading companies. Programs like \nour Entrepreneur Camp for Black Founders and \nDevelopers  give app founders and developers \nguidance and support from Apple experts so \nthey can take their app experience to the next \nlevel. We\u2019re also partnering with Michigan \nState University to open an Apple Developer \nAcademy in Detroit, a city with a vibrant Black \nentrepreneur and developer community and over \n50,000 minority-owned businesses.22 Our work \nto promote Black and Brown businesses extends \nto our own business activities, where we are \nincreasing Apple\u2019s spend with diverse suppliers.\nRead more in Using our purchasing power \nfor\u00a0good  (p43).Introduction Our Business Appendix Our People Suppliers Customers Environment Apple\u2019s 2021 ESG Report   45 Communities", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2021.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
