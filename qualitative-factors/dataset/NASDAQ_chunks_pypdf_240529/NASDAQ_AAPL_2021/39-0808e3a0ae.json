{"page_content": "Supplier employees\nEveryone deserves to be treated with dignity \nand to have their rights respected. As part of \nour Supplier Code of Conduct, we require our \nsuppliers to provide their employees with training \non their rights. Apple also directly engages with \ntens of thousands of supplier employees on their \nworkplace experiences each year\u2014because the \nmore we\u00a0listen and learn, the better we\u00a0all are.\nWorker rights \nSince 2008, 21.5 million supplier employees \nhave been trained on their rights. Building on this \nprogress, we\u2019re working with partners to deliver \ndigital worker rights training to supplier employees, \nenabling better learning and more accurate \nknowledge gap identification. \nSuppliers are required to respect the rights of their \nemployees to form or join, or refrain from joining, \norganizations of their choice, and to bargain \ncollectively. Even where the right to freedom of \nassociation or collective bargaining is restricted \nunder local law, suppliers are prohibited from \nobstructing alternative legal means for workers \nto associate or to individually and collectively \nengage with their employer without interference, \ndiscrimination, retaliation, or harassment. In \n2020, 562 supplier facilities in 25 countries \nemployed unionized workers, and 422 sites had \nnegotiated collective bargaining agreements \nwith\u00a0their employees. Worker voice \nListening directly to rights holders is critical to \ncreating safe and equitable workplaces. Our Code \nand Standards require worker feedback channels, \nincluding grievance mechanisms at supplier sites. \nThese grievance mechanisms include third-party \nanonymous hotlines and the ability to contact the \nApple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation \nteam at any time, and in any language.\nWorker interviews are an important part of every \nsupplier assessment we conduct. In 2020, we \ninterviewed 57 ,618 supply chain workers, in their \nlocal language and without their managers present, \nto confirm that their experience on the job aligns \nwith our observations during assessments.\nIn 2019 we began anonymously measuring \nsupplier employees\u2019 general satisfaction at work \nand in 2020 we surveyed 196,647 workers from \n135\u00a0facilities across Greater China, India, Ireland, \nthe UK, U.S., and Vietnam. The surveys sought \nfeedback on different aspects of the workplace, \nincluding working and living conditions, food, \nand management. And as a result of these \nsurveys, suppliers took 3173 actions to address \nworker feedback, including adding shuttle buses, \nreducing turnaround time for addressing worker \ngrievances, increasing bonuses, and improving \ndorm maintenance.\nWe are also exploring additional digital tools to \nfurther scale worker voice across our supply chain, \nincluding a digital platform that combines digital \nand in-person training to help suppliers gather \nand address worker grievances, measure worker \nsatisfaction, and provide health and well-being \ntraining and services to their employees.For detailed information on \nour assessment process \nand how we remediate Core \nViolations, read How We \nWork With  Suppliers .Introduction Our Business Appendix Our People Customers Communities Environment Apple\u2019s 2021 ESG Report   40 Suppliers", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2021.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
