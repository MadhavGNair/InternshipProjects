This SBTi-approved target is derived \nfrom our current target\u2014to reduce emissions by \n75 percent by 2030\u2014only with a 2019 base year, \ninstead of 2015.\n2 Based on sales-weighted averages of Mac, \niPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod, \nAirPods, and Beats.\n3 Eligible products are those in a product category \nfor which ENERGY STAR certification exists. \nFor more information, visit www.energystar.gov . \nENERGY STAR and the ENERGY STAR mark \nare registered trademarks owned by the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n4 Annualized metric tons of supply chain carbon \ncompared to fiscal year 2019 metrics.

We define \nfreshwater as drinking-water quality, the majority of \nwhich comes from municipal sources and less than \n5 percent comes from onsite groundwater sources. \nRecycled water represents a key alternative water \nsource. Our recycled water is sourced primarily \nfrom municipal treatment plants, with less than \n5 percent from onsite treatment. Recycled water \nis primarily used for irrigation, make-up water in \ncooling, or toilet flushing. Other alternative sources \nof freshwater include rainwater and recovered \ncondensate that is captured onsite. Water used \nfor construction for activities like dust control is \nnot included in this total, and represents 8 million \ngallons of water used in fiscal year 2020. Our \nactual water discharge may vary by 10 percent \nrelative to our estimates. In these estimates, \nwe\u2019ve taken into account consumptive activities, \nincluding irrigation and cooling towers.8 These savings do not include reduction in water \nuse from facility closures and reduced occupancy \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider those \nsavings temporary and also acknowledge that the \nwater use was transferred to employees\u2019 homes.\n9 All established final assembly supplier sites\u2014or \nthose that have been Apple suppliers for more \nthan one year\u2014for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple \nWatch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats \nare third-party certified as Zero Waste by UL \nLLC (UL 2799 Standard). UL requires at least \n90 percent diversion through methods other than \nwaste to energy to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill \n(Silver 90\u201394 percent, Gold 95\u201399 percent, and \nPlatinum\u00a0100 percent) designations.\n10 Though we do not use the Federal Employer \nInformation Report EEO-1 to measure progress, \nour most recent filing is publicly available on our \nInclusion & Diversity website.
