In 2016, \nwe launched the Full Material Disclosure program \nto catalog and map every chemical our products \ncontain. Each supplier is required to report the \nmaterials used to manufacture Apple products, \nusing our library of over 40,000 materials to \naccurately identify each material.\nWe prioritize the health and safety of the people \nwho make our products. Our Supplier Code of \nConduct  and Supplier Responsibility Standards  \nset clear workplace safety requirements, and our \nChemical Safety Disclosure program advances \ndisclosure around the chemistries used in \nmanufacturing processes. We have identified \n14,000 unique chemicals and applications, \nenabling us to remove those that don\u2019t meet \nour standards. Assessment\nWith our products, we aim to make the best \nchemical and material choices to protect both \npersonal and environmental health. Our Regulated \nSubstances Specification sets standards for the \nchemicals in our products and manufacturing \nprocesses, which exceed many regional \nregulatory requirements.\nApple\u2019s Environmental Testing Lab performs  \nchemical analyses to evaluate the safety of our \nproducts and materials and to monitor compliance \nwith the specifications. Our assessment system  \nhelps ensure that only materials that meet our \nstringent requirements can be used in Apple \nproducts. Each year, we conduct more than 100 \nassessments on chemicals before they are used  \nin our manufacturing processes.\nInnovation\nOur efforts to map and assess the chemicals within \nour supply chain ultimately fuel innovations at Apple \nand with our suppliers. We use toxicology data at \neach point in the product life cycle to seek out and \ndevelop safer chemistries, continually improving \nthe overall safety of our products and processes. \nSince the late 1990s, we have diligently identified \nand removed potentially harmful chemicals from \nour products. This has required developing \nalternatives by creating safer compounds \nto replace potentially harmful chemistries or \nreplacing\u00a0components with alternatives that \nmeet\u00a0our safety standards.\nWe\u2019re also partnering with nongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs) to cascade our materials \ndata throughout the electronics industry. Through \nChem FORWARD , we are able to share our list of \nsafer cleaners and degreasers with companies \nbeyond our supply chain and outside our industry. \nWe\u2019ve also worked with the Clean Electronics \nProduction Network to develop the Process \nChemicals Data Collection Tool, which supports \ndata collection on process chemicals used in the \nelectronics industry.Introduction Our Business Appendix Our People Suppliers Customers Communities Apple\u2019s 2021 ESG Report   12 Environment", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2021.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
