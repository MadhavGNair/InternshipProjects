At every stage of the pandemic, \nwe make decisions based on the latest local data \nand public health guidance, and we share lessons \nacross our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) \nteams globally so we can continuously improve \nour\u00a0safety programs.\nProtecting our people\nWe\u2019re always working hard to ensure our \nemployees and contractors are safe no matter \nwhere they are when they\u2019re conducting business \nfor Apple. We abide by EHS requirements in every \ncountry where we operate, to ensure the safety  \nand well-being of our global teams.\nManaging work-related hazards and risks\nTo ensure the safety of our employees and \ncustomers, we put procedures in place to identify \nthe potential risks associated with workplace \nactivities and to mitigate possible hazards. We \nsupport and protect employees in lower hazard \nspaces, and put special programs in place \nfor smaller groups working in higher hazard \nenvironments, including chemical management, \nlaser safety, equipment and machinery safety, \nhazardous materials management, and \nelectrical safety. Employees can request to \nhave their workspaces individually inspected \nto identify hazards and controls, including \nergonomics evaluations. Our EHS teams identify and provide appropriate \npersonal protective equipment (PPE) for specific \nhazards, which is provided to employees at no cost \nand with training on correct use. Additionally, EHS \nconducts mandatory health checks for employees \nwhere they are required.\nWe invest in new technologies and talent to \ncontinually manage risks across our operations, \nincluding manufacturing in Cork, Ireland. These \nstandards, programs, trainings, procedures, \nand other safeguards are managed by trained \nEHS professionals, and where required, we also \ntranslate EHS procedures into local languages \nfor\u00a0our employees.\nRisks identified from incidents, injuries, and \nnon-routine events are addressed immediately \nfor corrective action, and integrated into future \nprogram development and training. Lessons \nlearned are routinely communicated across Apple\u2019s \nEHS team and potentially affected operations, and \nare used to inform updates to existing policies and \nprocedures if necessary.\nEmployees and managers can report incidents, \nnear-misses, and observations\u2014including newly \nidentified hazards and risks\u2014through an internal \niOS app. Incident responses are addressed by \nApple\u2019s EHS team through a consistent process \nthat connects employees with care and support \nwhile identifying corrective actions where \nappropriate to prevent future occurrences.Read more about our \nhazardous waste and \nchemical safety procedures \nin our 2021 Environmental \nProgress  Report .Introduction Our Business Appendix Suppliers Customers Communities Environment Apple\u2019s 2021 ESG Report   23 Our People", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2021.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
