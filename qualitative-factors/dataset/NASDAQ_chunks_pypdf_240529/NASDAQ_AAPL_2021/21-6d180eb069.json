With our Apple Card \nCustomer Assistance Program, we also offered \ncustomers the option to skip their monthly \npayments without incurring interest. Across \nmany of our stores, we were able to serve \nour customers\u2019 needs through contactless \npickup, express storefronts, and new online \nsupport. In store, mandatory face masks, \nphysical distancing, temperature checks, and \ndeep-cleaning procedures were put in place \nto keep our teams and customers safe. Our \nresponse to COVID-19 is still ongoing, and \nwe are committed to implementing health \nprotocols and adjusting store operations as \nrequired based on available data and guidance \nfrom health officials.\nHelping our suppliers adapt\nFrom the early days of the pandemic, we \nworked hand in hand with our suppliers to \ndeploy a range of protections suited to their \nlocal circumstances, which included measures \nsuch as health screenings, limiting density, and \nensuring strict adherence to social distancing in their facilities. We strengthened our incident \nreporting mechanisms to more clearly include \nthe reporting of any infectious disease \nincidents to Apple. This has allowed us to track \nCOVID-19 cases at supplier facilities around \nthe world, from initial reporting to recovery, \nand to engage with each of these sites \nindividually to confirm they have the correct \nprotocols in place to keep their employees safe \nand healthy. \nWe have worked closely with suppliers to help \nsupport their ability to pay their hourly workers. \nAnd we have further supported our business \npartners by accelerating our payments to \nsuppliers and extending payment and credit \nterms for our resellers. We also partnered with \nNGOs to help further support people deeper \nin our supply chain through an unprecedented \ntime, particularly those from vulnerable groups \nlike migrant workers and mining communities.\nGiving back to our communities\nWe also made significant contributions \ntoward relief efforts supporting healthcare \nprofessionals, first responders, and impacted \ncommunities worldwide.
