He drove his pickup truck over countless miles \nof narrow roads to visit farmers and help them with a range of \nsustainability issues and ensure a long-term supply of quality coffee. \nCarlos helped farmers set up their own test plots, showed them how to \nspace trees correctly and offered suggestions to manage erosion and \nreduce the use of pesticides.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important for customers to know how \ndifficult it is to produce high-quality coffee,\u201d  \nhe said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we support the farmers.\u201d\nFor Carlos, Starbucks progress in supporting farming communities is \nbest measured one farm, one farmer at a time.\n\u201cTo me, as a professional, as a partner, it\u2019s the best part really when you \nstart working with a particular farmer and see that they are improving \ntheir living conditions and being able to keep producing coffee as a \ngood business,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best. It\u2019s really something that \nmotivates us.\u201d\nGlobal Environmental & Social Impact Report     13\n\u00a9 2022 Starbucks Corporation.
