{"page_content": "Before joining Starbucks as a store manager in Southern California, \nJoe spent 15 years in the restaurant business, eight of them as a \nchef. When COVID-19 became a pandemic and everyone started \nwearing masks, Joe realized he was suddenly deprived of his primary \ncommunication tool: reading lips.\nJoe, 28, was born in Guam, unable to fully hear sounds \u2014 especially \nwhispers or anything said behind him. Doctors eventually diagnosed \nhim with otosclerosis, a condition caused by the abnormal growth of the \ntiny bones inside the ears that commonly contributes to hearing loss.\n\u201cGrowing up, I was classified as Deaf,\u201d Joe says. \u201cI was very ashamed \nof my hearing. I was embarrassed. I thought if people found out, they \nwouldn\u2019t want to be my friend, wouldn\u2019t want to talk to me, wouldn\u2019t \nwant to hire me. So I taught myself how to read lips, read the room. I \ntaught myself things to be and feel normal. I wore hearing aids as a \nlittle kid, but after a while I would take them off when I got to school...  \nI saw how other kids would act toward kids with disabilities.\u201d\nRecently, his twin girls \u2014 with the help of his wife and father-in-law \u2014 \ngifted him with a new pair of hearing aids. They were an unexpected \nblessing. They also gave him the confidence to seek out community \nand a career outside his comfort zone, which led him to Starbucks.\n\u201cI started to embrace my Deafness and decided I want \nto learn more about it and inspire other people with \nDeafness,\u201d Joe says. \u201cWho knows, maybe there\u2019s \na handful of partners out there who are afraid or \nembarrassed to share. I want to let them know it\u2019s all \nright. We\u2019re all just people at the end of the day.\u201dGlobal Environmental & Social Impact Report     17\n\u00a9 2022 Starbucks Corporation.
