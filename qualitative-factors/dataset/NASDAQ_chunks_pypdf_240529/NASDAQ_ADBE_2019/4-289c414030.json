We started working toward our \n100% renewable energy goal years ago. We became \nan early member of RE100  and joined the Science  \nBased Targets initiative  with verified goals, and in  \n2020 we committed to increasing the ambition of  \nour targets. \nWe advocate for local, regional, and federal policies to \ndecarbonize and modernize our grids and open them \nup to renewable energy for everyone, not just our own \nbusiness. Most importantly, we plan to reach our goal \nwithout purchasing any unbundled renewable energy \ncredits or carbon offsets. Saving money, saving resources\nWe also help our customers practice sustainability \nthrough their use of Adobe products. Developed in \npartnership with the Environmental Paper \nNetwork, our Resource Saver Calculator enables \ncustomers to see exactly how many natural \nresources they can save\u2014and the emissions and \ncosts they can avoid\u2014by using Adobe Document \nCloud and Adobe Sign. In the summer of 2019, we broke \nground on the North Tower\u2014an 18-  \nstory, all-electric building.
