In 2019, a record 70% of Adobe employees \nparticipated in giving and volunteer programs, lending both  \ntheir time and unique talents to nonprofits.  Empowering every voice\nWe partner with organizations that share our commitment  \nto elevating diverse voices and creating greater opportunities  \nfor all, especially the underrepresented. In 2019, we awarded  \n$3.5 million in creativity and STEAM (Science, Technology, \nEngineering, Arts, and Math) scholarships and we reached  \nover 150,000 youth in 25 countries through the Adobe  \nCreativity Network. As founding members of the Sundance  \nIgnite Program, we\u2019ve helped young, aspiring filmmakers  \ntap into their creativity to shape the future of filmmaking.\nLifting our communities\nWe strongly believe in giving back to the communities in  \nwhich we live and work. In 2019, we supported 60,000 non-  \nprofit organizations and invested approximately $50 million  \nin our communities. We partnered with nonprofits around the \nworld to help them achieve their goals. The National Center  \nfor Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) leverages Adobe \nPhotoshop and Adobe Experience Cloud to help keep children \nsafe. We were honored to receive  NCMEC\u2019s 2019 Hope Award  \nfor our ongoing partnership and support of their mission.\nOur technology has broad societal impact as it\u2019s democratizing \ncreativity and storytelling for all . By providing tools that allow \npeople to tell their stories, we empower all voices. We support \nthis mission by starting early\u2014in the classroom and through educators. And, with 23 million students having access  \nto Adobe Spark, we\u2019re helping the next generation build  \nthe skills they need to compete in the digital age.\nBuilding a sustainable future\nIn our pursuit to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2035,  \nwe quadrupled our renewable electricity deployment in  \n2019 without the use of offsets or unbundled renewable  \nenergy credits. We also announced  our commitment to set  \nnew, more ambitious Science Based Targets to align with  \nupdated climate guidance. As a result of these actions, we  \nwere named to both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index  \nand the CDP A List in 2019 for the fourth consecutive year.  \nWhile we\u2019re facing difficult times now, I\u2019m encouraged  \nby the tremendous dedication and innovation I see from  \nour employees, customers, and communities. I\u2019m optimistic  \nthat if we continue to work together, we can lift each other  \nup and emerge stronger than ever before.   \nSincerely,  \nShantanu Narayen  \nChairman, President & CEO, Adobe, Inc.  A Message from Our CEO: Focus on 2019\nAdobe\u2019s core belief that digital experiences \nhave the power to change the world guides \nour efforts to champion our employees, \nempower every voice, lift our communities, \nand work to build a sustainable future. \nWhile much has changed since 2019, as  \nwe reflect on the year, we\u2019re proud of our \nprogress and the impact of our team.  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADBE_2019.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
