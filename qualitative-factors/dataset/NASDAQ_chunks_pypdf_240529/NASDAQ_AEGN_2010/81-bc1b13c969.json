{"page_content": " \n \n \n \n Boiled\t eggs\t in\tEdinburgh\nImproved classroom concentration, better social skills and the remarkable discovery of the boiled egg: these have \nbeen some of the unexpected benefits for children attending AEGON\u2019s Breakfast Clubs in the United Kingdom. The Breakfast Clubs were developed by AEGON\u2019s office in Edinburgh with a simple goal in mind: providing children in disadvantaged areas of the city a healthy breakfast before school begins. But the results have extended beyond the limits of nutritional guidelines. \n\u201cChildren who were always late are now punctual, and their social skills have advanced,\u201d said Neil Smith, \nCommunity Sponsorship and Development Coordinator at AEGON UK. \u201cThese are kids from families with real challenges \u2013 unemployment, alcoholism, drugs \u2013 and they\u2019re setting their napkins in their laps and asking, \u2018Can you pass me the milk, please? We\u2019re also seeing a positive impact on their schoolwork. With a decent breakfast inside them, they find it easier to concentrate in the classroom.\u201d\nFor the children at Clovenstone Primary School in Edinburgh, one of the program\u2019s surprise educational \ndiscoveries was \u2026 boiled eggs. \u201cThey\u2019d never seen an egg before,\u201d said Helen Syme, AEGON\u2019s Corporate Responsibility Manager in Edinburgh. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to do with them, how to cut them or peel them or eat them.\u201d \nThe Breakfast Club program operates on a shoestring: the annual budget for each school that signs up is just \nGBP 5,000. AEGON works to find local businesses and organizations that will sponsor the program and cover these basic operating expenses, acting, said Mr. Smith, as \u201ca kind of dating agency\u201d. It\u2019s proof that often time and energy count for as much as financial support. \nAEGON\t backs\t United\t Way\t to\tbetter\t health\t and\teducation\nFor a number of years, AEGON has supported United Way in both the United States and Canada. In 2010, AEGON and its employees raised a total of USD 1.22 million for the organization \u2013 nearly 20% of the company\u2019s overall donations program. United Way was founded more than a hundred years ago \u2013 by a group of local and religious leaders. Since then, the non-profit, volunteer-based organization has blossomed. Today, it numbers more than 1,800 local, community-based groups in 45 countries around the world. \nSome 1,300 of those groups are in the United States. United Way focuses on three main areas: improving \neducation for schoolchildren, helping deprived families increase their income and their financial stability and promoting healthy lives. AEGON raises money for United Way at its offices across the United States \u2013 in Florida, Texas, Maryland, Georgia, California and Iowa, as well as in Toronto in Canada. \nAmong other projects, United Way has been helping victims of the devastating 2005 hurricane on the US Gulf \ncoast as well as working with schools and colleges across the country. United Way has annual revenues of more than USD 4 billion. \nCONTENTS82\n SUSTAINABILITY 2010  THE WIDER COMMUNITY\nSHARPENING OUR FOCUS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2010.pdf", "page": 81, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
