Brand is about customer service \u2013 making sure you always exceed your customers\u2019 expectations. Too many companies lose the trust of their customers because they overpromise. Better to under-promise and over-deliver. But brand is also about employees. Energized and engaged employees make a difference to customers and strengthen the brand. Employees have the power to change things for the better.\u201d\n\u2013 Robert Collignon, Head of Brand and Customer Strategy\nCONTENTS37\n SUSTAINABILITY 2010  CUSTOMERS\nSHARPENING OUR FOCUS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2010.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
