In addition, this restatement has led to \nan adjustment in figures for AEGON\u2019s total emissions of carbon dioxide. \n \n\u0003\u0002Figures for AEGON\u2019s consumption of gas and water in the United Kingdom for 2009 have been restated following \na data error. \n\u0003\u0002Figures for water use in China have been included on a pro rata basis. \n\u0003\u0002AEGON saw a significant increase in waste production in 2010. This was due mainly to the introduction of a new \nmeasurement system at AEGON\u2019s operations in the United Kingdom. \n\u0003\u0002Some figures have been rounded. \n \nCONTENTS75\n SUSTAINABILITY 2010  THE WIDER COMMUNITY\nSHARPENING OUR FOCUS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2010.pdf", "page": 74, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
