{"page_content": "WHO ARE OUR STAKEHOLDERS?\nIt is important for a company like AEGON to define clearly who its stakeholders are. AEGON\u2019s view is that any \nindividual or group of individuals who are affected by the company\u2019s operations, or who, in turn, affect the social, \neconomic or environmental climate in which AEGON operates, should be considered a stakeholder of the company. \nAEGON\u2019s approach is to engage with all stakeholder groups as actively as possible and to take their interests into \naccount when making decisions. For ease of reporting, AEGON divides its stakeholders into five main groups:\nStakeholder\t group \u2018Direct\t relationship\u2019 \u2018Indirect\t relationship\u2019\nCustomers \u0003\u0002Policyholders, savers and other individual \ninvestors\n\u0003\u0002Pensioners\n\u0003\u0002Companies and multinational corporations\n\u0003\u0002Other institutional clients\n\u0003\u0002Potential customers\u0003\u0002Consumer associations\n\u0003\u0002Single issue groups\nEmployees \u0003\u0002Full-time employees\n\u0003\u0002Part-time employees\n\u0003\u0002Tied agents\n\u0003\u0002Former employees and potential new \nemployees\u0003\u0002Trade unions and other employee \nrepresentative bodies\nBusiness\t partners \u0003\u0002 Joint venture partners\n\u0003\u0002 Banks\n\u0003\u0002Financial advisors, brokers, agents and \nother intermediaries and distributors\n\u0003\u0002 Suppliers\u0003\u0002Industry associations and forums\nWider\t community \u0003\u0002 Charitable organizations\n\u0003\u0002 Non-governmental and humanitarian \norganizations\n\u0003\u0002 Individuals and organizations sponsored \nby AEGON\n\u0003\u0002 Governments, and insurance and financial \nindustry regulators\u0003\u0002 International and governmental bodies and \nassociations\n\u0003\u0002 Organizations issuing rules and guidelines \nimplemented by AEGON\n\u0003\u0002 Sustainability rating agencies \nInvestors \u0003\u0002 Retail shareholders and bondholders\n\u0003\u0002 Institutional investors\n\u0003\u0002 Financial analysts\u0003\u0002 Shareholder and other investor \nrepresentative groups\n\u0003\u0002 Financial rating agencies\nAEGON realizes that the interests of various stakeholder groups may not always coincide, and that this may give rise \nto dilemmas for the company.
