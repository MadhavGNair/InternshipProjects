{"page_content": "AEGON\tUniversity  has been in existence now for the past sixteen years. The program takes in talented AEGON \nemployees from around the world and gives them the opportunity to share knowledge and experience, as well as to \nlearn more about the company, its businesses and its strategy. In 2010, AEGON updated the University program to take \ninto account changes in business practice and the business environment, particularly since the global financial crisis. \nThe work of the University is supported by other programs, including the AEGON\tAmericas\tLeadership\tAcademy . \nAEGON also has an organization called Young\tAEGON , a network of employees designed to share information and \nbest practice, and a two-year leadership development program in the United States. AEGON Asset Management also \noffers additional coaching, mentoring and development programs in the United States, the Netherlands and the \nUnited Kingdom. \n \nIn 2010, AEGON introduced a Global\tAssignment\tPolicy , covering employees temporarily working outside their home \ncountries. This policy is part of wider efforts to manage AEGON as a single, international company, and is aimed at \nencouraging greater mobility within the AEGON workforce. The policy also aims to ensure employees are able to \nmaintain rights and benefits in their home countries while on expatriate assignments overseas. \n \nMEASURING EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT \nAEGON has a number of measures in place to improve levels of employee satisfaction and engagement. These include \nemployee recognition programs and initiatives to strengthen internal communications. Most AEGON country units \ncarry out a survey of employees at least once a year. Participation rates vary, but average between 75% and 80%. \nOnly three country units currently do not carry out regular surveys: China, Romania and Spain.
