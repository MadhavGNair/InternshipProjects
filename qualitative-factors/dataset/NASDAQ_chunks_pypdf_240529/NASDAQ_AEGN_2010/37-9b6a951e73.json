In Mexico \nand Brazil, AEGON is using worksite marketing to reach middle-income customers who were previously uninsured. With worksite marketing, it\u2019s a win-win situation. Employees are able to pay premiums through payroll deduction, making life insurance quick and easy. Employers, meanwhile, can offer their staff insurance as an additional benefit, an advantage when it comes to recruitment. Worksite marketing is already AEGON\u2019s main distribution channel in both Mexico and Brazil \u2013 and there is every prospect worksite marketing will continue to grow in the years ahead. \nCONTENTS38\n SUSTAINABILITY 2010  CUSTOMERS\nSHARPENING OUR FOCUS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2010.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
