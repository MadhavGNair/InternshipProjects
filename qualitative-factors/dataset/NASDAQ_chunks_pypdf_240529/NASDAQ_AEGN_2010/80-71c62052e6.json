{"page_content": " \n \n \n AEGON\u2019s\t early-stage\t support\t helps\t in\tthe\tfight\t against\t cancer\nFor the past ten years, AEGON has funded an international cancer research program, bringing together \nuniversities in both the United States and the Netherlands. AEGON\u2019s support fills a gap often left by regular funding organizations and gives scientists an opportunity to pursue innovative ideas and research that otherwise might go unexplored. Two recent examples include a new method for screening for breast cancer and applying drugs originally developed to combat other illnesses. \nAccording to the World Health Organization, cancer kills between 7 million and 8 million people each year. In the \nUnited States and many parts of Western Europe, cancer is already the second biggest killer behind heart disease. \nTraditionally, the research program funded by AEGON has focused on three types of cancer: breast, prostate and \ncolon. But increasingly researchers are taking a broader approach, classifying cancers by their \u2018biological mechanisms\u2019 rather than simply by the organs they typically attack. It\u2019s an approach that has significant implications for the way cancers are treated, allowing scientists to tailor treatment to individual patients and thereby increase their chances of success. \nThe research program has made significant progress, but there is work still to be done. \u201cWe have to bear in mind \nthat cancer is one of the leading causes of death, that cancer is generally a disease of elderly people and that we are all getting older,\u201d says Elsken van der Wall from the University Medical Center in Utrecht, one of the universities involved in the program. \u201cCancer is the big threat. It\u2019s not about what we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s about what we\u2019re going to do next.\u201d\nBringing\t hope\t to\tHaiti\nSince January 2010\u2019s devastating earthquake, AEGON and its employees around the world have donated more than EUR 270,000 to help rebuild Haiti\u2019s shattered infrastructure. AEGON has been working closely with aid organization CARE International to bring better sanitation and safe drinking water to thousands of people in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, a coastal town about 30 kilometers from the capital, Port-au-Prince. Even before the earthquake, it was estimated that nearly half the population had no access to clean water. Now, in the months following the disaster, the need has become even more acute with the outbreak of cholera in many areas of the island. CARE\u2019s project involves working with local communities to dig new wells and boreholes, lay pipes and set up new schools and health centers. The project will also improve water supply to a local hospital and help people in the small community of \u00c7a ira, who often have to travel by boat to another part of the island to fetch water. Over the next 18 months, working with AEGON and other donors, CARE expects to help at least 14,000 people in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne and elsewhere. \nIt\u2019s estimated that the January 2010 earthquake killed around 200,000 people in Haiti and left another 1.5 million \nhomeless. The disaster struck an island already weakened by poverty and political instability. But that doesn\u2019t mean Haitians have lost belief in their future. \u201cEvery day, our colleagues see just how unbelievably resilient people are,\u201d says Guus Eskens, Managing Director of CARE Netherlands. \u201cThousands of Haitians have literally lost everything, but not the will to rebuild their country.\u201d CARE International is one of the world\u2019s best known aid organizations, with projects in over 70 countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa. CARE has been working in Haiti since 1957.\nCONTENTS81\n SUSTAINABILITY 2010  THE WIDER COMMUNITY\nSHARPENING OUR FOCUS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2010.pdf", "page": 80, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
