This principle of non-discrimination is also contained in AEGON\u2019s Business \nPrinciples. AEGON also takes steps to comply with local legislation with regard to equal pay and treatment. \n \nIn addition, AEGON has mechanisms in place to deal with cases of discrimination, including the Global Ethics Line, \nwhich enables employees to report in confidence possible violations of the company\u2019s Code of Conduct or other areas \nof concern. In the United States, AEGON has a similar toll-free helpline called SHARE. Any alleged violations not dealt \nwith internally are referred usually to external employment tribunals. AEGON offers computer-based training to staff \nin the United States and the United Kingdom on issues relating to non-discrimination and equal employment. In 2010, \nAEGON employees reported two separate incidents of alleged discrimination. In both cases action was taken. \n \nAEGON also takes measures to encourage those with family commitments to remain in the workforce, and to take up \npositions in management.
