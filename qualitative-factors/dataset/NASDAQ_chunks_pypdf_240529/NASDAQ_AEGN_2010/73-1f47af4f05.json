These objectives are also contained in the company\u2019s business principles \nand its Code of Conduct, which apply to all AEGON employees worldwide. In the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, \nAEGON works with environmental management systems which: \n\u0003\u0002Identify the potential impact of the company\u2019s operations on the environment. \n\u0003\u0002Ensure compliance with local legislation. \n\u0003\u0002Encourage local policies and initiatives in this area. \n \nAEGON and its employees around the world support good\tcauses\tand\tcharitable\torganizations .

In 2010, AEGON\u2019s per employee use of electricity \nand gas remained stable. A reduction in overall electricity and gas consumption was offset during the year by a \ndecrease in the company\u2019s workforce in its main markets \u2013 the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. \nPaper consumption also declined as a result of an increase in online activities. Water consumption, on a per employee \nbasis, rose by 9%, while use of recycled paper increased, as did waste recycling. Air travel rose by 8% in 2010, \nreflecting an improvement in business conditions, but air travel remains significantly below 2008 levels. \n \nEnergy\t\n\t\nUnit 2010 2009 % change\nElectricity GwH 150.9 154.6 (2.4%)\n\u2013 Per capita KwH 5,493 5,452 0.7%\nGas Million cubic meters 3.6 3.7 (3.4%)\n\u2013 Per capita Cubic meters 129.8 130.1 (0.2%)\n \nOther\t raw\tmaterials\t\n\t\nUnit 2010 2009 % change\nPaper Metric tons 4,331 5,077 (14.5%)\n\u2013 Per capita Kilograms 158 179 (11.7%)\n\u2013  Recycled paper as % \nof total use Percent 38% 20% 95%\nWater Cubic meters 455,770 434,915 4.8%\n\u2013 Per capita Liters/day 72.4 66.6 8.7%\n\t\u0003\u0003THE WIDER COMMUNITY \nCONTENTS\n SHARPENING OUR FOCUS74 SUSTAINABILITY 2010  THE WIDER COMMUNITY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2010.pdf", "page": 73, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
