Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT): \nFacilitates the transfer of information through  \nthe supply chain regarding mineral country  \nof origin, and smelters and refiners used; we \nrequire all in-scope suppliers to complete and \nsubmit the CMRT.  \n2.  Cobalt Report Template (CRT): Facilitates the \ntransfer of information through the supply chain \nregarding cobalt country origin and smelters \nand refiners used; we require all in-scope \nsuppliers to complete and submit the CRT.  \n3.  Country Risk Map Tool: Provides a framework \nand guidance to monitor high-risk suppliers and \nsmelters and allows our program manager to \ndevelop a country risk indicator to monitor risk \nlevels by country with an 80% and above \nconfidence level.The CMRT, CRT and Country Risk Map Tool together \nallow us to map our smelters and suppliers, and \ndetermine which sourcing practices will be \nevaluated with RCOI data. Our approach includes \nseveral key components:  \n \u25aa Developing a risk management plan that \nincludes due diligence reviews of relevant \nsuppliers and smelters or refiners  \n \u25aa Using tools available for RMI members to review \nthe smelters or refiners reported by our \nsuppliers and assess the quality of the responses \nin their CMRTs  \n \u25aa Incorporating the information and the result of \nthis assessment into supplier risk profiles in our \nsupply chain base  Strong Company  \nManagement SystemIdentify & Assess  \nSupply Chain RisksDesign & Implement  \nStrategy to Respond  \nto Identified RisksSupport Independent  \nThird-Party Audits  \nof Smelter/Refiner  \nDue DiligenceReport Annually  \non Supply Chain  \nDue Diligence\n \u25aa Reviewing risk profiles to mitigate any risks to \nsuppliers or smelters  \n \u25aa Informing Procurement of the high-risk suppliers \nand developing an action plan to mitigate the risk  \n \u25aa Working with suppliers to mitigate the risk for \nidentified high-risk smelters, via direct outreach \nwith the smelter or indirectly via collaborating \nwith customers or engaging with industry-level \nworking groups  \nConduct Supplier Risk Assessment\nWe conduct risk assessments based on multiple \nfactors, including smelter or refiner certification \nstatus, \u201cred flags\u201d identified and the supplier \nrelationship. Western Digital escalates suppliers in \nhigher-risk categories in accordance with our risk \nmitigation procedures. We use a formal tracking \nmechanism to track the supplier risk assessment \nand the risk mitigation activities performed.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WDC_2019.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
