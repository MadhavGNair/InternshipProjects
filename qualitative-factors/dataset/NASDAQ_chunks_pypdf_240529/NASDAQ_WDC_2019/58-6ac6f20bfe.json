Our risk \nassessments evaluate where we do business, \nthe type of business we conduct, the risks \nof corruption in those countries and current \ncircumstances at the time of the assessment (e.g., \ntrade tensions). The assessments also include \ntesting multiple variables, controls and triggering \nevents, allowing us to understand where to \nproperly deploy resources most effectively. If risk \nassessments identify improvement opportunities, \nwe perform risk mitigation planning and execution \nto ensure our business addresses key risks. No major \ndeficiencies were identified in any reviews in 2019.Anti-Corruption\nWe follow several practices to manage corruption \nrisks in Western Digital\u2019s operations: \n \u25aa Implementing an Ethics and Compliance  \npre-approval process for conflicts of interest, \ncharitable contributions, gifts, entertainment, \nmarket development funds, travel and other \nexpense items \n \u25aa Performing risk-based due diligence on our \nintermediaries, including suppliers and customers, \nand ongoing due diligence where appropriate \n \u25aa Providing annual training for employees during \nour Compliance Awareness Month, and strategic \ntraining throughout the year for targeted  \nhigher-risk groups\n \u25aa Providing training during supplier events hosted \nat our sites to communicate our expectation \nthat suppliers understand and follow our policies \nand know how to report concerns \n \u25aa Monitoring our operations continually through \ninternal reviews of our processes and audits of \nour third parties \nOur policies strictly prohibit all forms of bribery  \nand corruption.
