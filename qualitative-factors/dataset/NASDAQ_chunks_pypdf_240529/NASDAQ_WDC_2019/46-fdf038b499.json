In 2019, all final-build \nmanufacturing sites were included on a new \nmulti-site ISO 45001 certificate. Western Digital \nalso conducts both internal and external audits  \nto evaluate compliance with applicable health  \nand safety laws, regulations and standards.\nAs part of our transition to ISO 45001, Western \nDigital formalized the processes related to \nconsultation and participation of workers. Through \nour global IMS, we establish the general \nrequirements and expectations, and sites further \ndefine and implement location-appropriate \nmethods for effective engagement with workers \non health and safety matters. A common approach \nis to form safety committees at each worksite, \ncomprised of cross-functional teams that meet \nregularly to discuss hazards observed in their work \nareas and implement preventative actions. Safety \ncommittee members work with health and  \nsafety personnel to keep track of injuries and \nillnesses, assess their root causes and recommend \ncorrective actions to avoid future recurrences. \nCommittee members also conduct periodic  \nfacility inspections and organize safety activities.\nHazard Identification and Risk Control\n403-2\nOur IMS involves a two-tiered approach for \nidentifying hazards and assessing risks and \nopportunities. At the corporate level, we analyze \nperformance trends to identify the top three to five focus areas globally, based on risk levels, \nseverity and likelihood. We set overarching \nprocedures we expect sites to follow using the \ntraditional hierarchy of controls. \nAt the facility level, sites assess each hazard \nidentified at the corporate level and customize \ntheir approach based on high-hazard risk areas  \nin the specific location. Certain sites go beyond \nthis initial level of assessment, further assessing \nequipment, tools, chemicals and processes.  \nEach hazard is scored on its level of severity and \nlikelihood to develop a composite risk rating.  \nWe prioritize risks rated high and immediately \nseek to mitigate them to a medium-risk level.\nAll employees have a right to stop work that  \nthey believe could cause injury or ill health,  \nand all Western Digital manufacturing processes  \nhave a standard Emergency Power-Off (EPO)  \nor Emergency Machine Off (EMO) switch if  \nan employee identifies an on-site hazard. \nAdditionally, employees have three avenues \nthrough which to report work-related hazards: \n1. Human Resources business partner \n2. Manager \n3. Western Digital\u2019s Ethics Helpline\nOur management team also conducts worksite \nanalysis on a regular basis: \n \u25aa Conduct periodic \u201cwalk-through\u201d of assigned \nareas, observing worker behaviors and \nidentifying potential unsafe conditions \n \u25aa Conduct periodic, systematic EHS&S \nassessments, and ensure we correct \ndiscrepancies in a timely fashion  \u25aa Ensure new processes, facilities rearrangements \nand equipment receive EHS&S reviews and \napproval prior to use \n \u25aa Investigate accidents and \u201cnear misses,\u201d \nidentifying and correcting root causes\n \u25aa Include results and trends of hazard identification \nand risk control in the Management Review \nprocess in addition to the worksite analysis  \nIn 2019, we focused on improving machine safety \ninterlocks to ensure the required engineering \ncontrol measures are in place and functional. \nAnother focus area was to implement and/or \nenhance our Safety Good Catch Program, which  \nis essential to enhancing employee awareness  \nof their surroundings and keeping them safe. A \nsafety good catch is recognition by a worker of  \na condition or situation that had the potential  \nto cause an incident, but did not cause one due  \nto corrective action and/or timely intervention  \nby the worker. In 2019, Western Digital workers \nidentified and reported 3,669 safety good catches, \nmost relating to minor hazards. \n403-7\nWestern Digital hires contractors and third parties for \nspecific projects or jobs requiring expertise outside \nour employees\u2019 skills or based on business strategy. \nOur OHS planning process includes evaluating and \nmitigating potential hazards and risks related to a \nspecific job or project reviewing the activity area \nand checking licenses of all operators. We require \nemployees to complete rigorous driver certifications \nbefore transporting chemicals or waste.
