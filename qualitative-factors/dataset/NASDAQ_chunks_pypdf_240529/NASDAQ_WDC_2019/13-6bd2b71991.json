{"page_content": "14Integrated Management System\nWestern Digital uses an Integrated Management \nSystem (IMS) to manage corporate quality, \nenvironmental, health and safety, and business \ncontinuity standards. Our IMS continually evolves, \nhelping us more effectively measure and disclose \nour commitment to protecting the environment, \nour people and our business sustainability. \nOur IMS Policy includes our commitment to protect \nthe environment. The IMS Policy is underpinned by \nindustry-recognized environmental certifications for \nall sites, including International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO) 14001. Visit our Sustainability \nCertifications webpage  for more information on \ncertifications earned through the IMS.Targets and Goals\nIn 2019, we set an aggressive FY2020 target for \nenergy conservation measures corresponding to \n>1.5% energy reduction of energy use throughout \nFY2019. We were more than halfway to achieving \nour target by the end of calendar year 2019,  \nand our Global ERM team is working to achieve \nadditional savings by the end of FY2020. \nAdditionally, we completed an initial assessment  \nof our Scope 3 emissions and are working in 2020 \non a more detailed Scope 3 assessment to \nsupport strategic long-term targets. See the ESG \nData Download  for additional information on \nScope 3 (product) GHG emissions.\nEnergy Resource Management Program\nWe reduce the amount of energy and carbon  \nin our operations through various ERM Program \ninitiatives. Since 2007, we have saved $39  \nmillion in energy costs by reducing our energy \nconsumption while collecting critically important \ninformation and data.\nWestern Digital\u2019s REO organization conducts \nregular assessments with local energy management \nexperts to review current operational processes \nand identify opportunities for higher energy \nefficiency. For example, we increase reliance on \nhigh-efficiency machines and further promote \nenergy efficiency through cost-neutral, procedural \nor behavioral changes. Additionally, we are \ncommissioning a renewable energy survey at our \nCalifornia and Asia-Pacific locations to gather data \nthat will help inform future decisions.\nIn 2019, Western Digital implemented several \nenergy efficiency measures, while simultaneously \nincreasing our throughout and enhancing our quality.  \n \u25aa At our Great Oaks campus in San Jose, California, \nwe reduced energy use at various laboratories \nby improving the heating, ventilation, and  \nair conditioning (HVAC) system. Engineering \npersonnel identified an opportunity to place \nseveral of the HVAC units on a building control \nsystem, allowing for effective control of air flow, \nespecially during non-peak operating hours.  \nThis project delivered savings of nearly 2 million \nkilowatt hours (kWh) during 2019. Simultaneously, \nthe project enabled improved air flow for \nlaboratory and facility engineering staff. The \nproject also resulted in an incentive from the \nlocal utility company covering over 50% of  \nthe total project cost.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WDC_2019.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
