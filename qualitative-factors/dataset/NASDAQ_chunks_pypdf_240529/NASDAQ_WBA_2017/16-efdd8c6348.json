Palm oil\nWalgreens Boots Alliance engages with numerous stakeholders regarding the traceability and sustainable sourcing of palm oil \u2013 which is used in certain food, beauty and personal care products and pharmaceuticals \u2013 as it develops processes to further reduce deforestation impacts of the ingredient. Our focus during fiscal 2017 was to evaluate processes in place at Boots UK, which is recognized for its use of certified palm oil, and to acquire tools that our Walgreens U.S. retail pharmacy business will use to track palm oil in products it sells.

For this reason, we expanded our CSR Governance disclosure in our Notice of 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement. We have also expanded the CSR governance information included in this report, on page 7. During 2017 the Board of Directors amended the Nominating and Governance Committee\u2019s charter to clarify its role in reviewing sustainability and CSR and assess our management of risks in those areas. This clarification was based, in part, upon stockholder and other stakeholder feedback we received in 2017.\nWe have also added a section to our \nreport, on data privacy and security,  \nin response to stockholder and customer feedback.
