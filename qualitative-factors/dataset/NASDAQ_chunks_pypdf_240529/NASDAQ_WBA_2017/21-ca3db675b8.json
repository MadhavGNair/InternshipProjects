Improved therapies mean that more and more people are living longer with cancer, which has increased the demand for information and support. In the U.S., a growing number of cancer patients self administer therapies at home rather than going to a cancer center  \nfor chemotherapy or radiation treatment. This means that the pharmacist is often the last healthcare provider to speak with a patient before they initiate their therapy. \nWalgreens pharmacists are certified \nby The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) after receiving specialized training in blood cancers.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WBA_2017.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
