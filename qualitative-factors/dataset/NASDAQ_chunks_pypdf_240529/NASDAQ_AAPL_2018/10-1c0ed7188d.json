{"page_content": "11\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017We apply strong principles for procuring \nrenewable energy.\nWe encounter many legal and regulatory frameworks around the world that \nlimit our renewable energy supply options. In each location, we endeavor to \nchoose the strongest approach available to us as defined by these guiding \nprinciples. \nDisplacement. We seek to displace more-polluting forms of energy in the \nsame electric grid region as our facilities. We accomplish this by having \nApple-created projects deliver into the grid an amount of renewable energy \nequal to the amount of energy our facilities use from that grid. For less than \n0.5 percent of our load that occurs in difficult renewable energy markets,  \nwe seek a renewable energy solution in the broader geographic region.\nMateriality. We strive to create new clean energy that adds to the energy \nsources already delivering to the grid. This means participating in renewable \nenergy projects in a manner that provides material support to the project\u2019s \nsuccess by overcoming financial, regulatory, or other barriers. \nAccountability.  We apply rigor in measuring and tracking our energy supply \nresources, and use third-party registries such as WREGIS and NC-RETS, \ncertification programs such as Green-e Energy, and contractual provisions \nto ensure that only Apple takes credit for the renewable energy it generates \nor procures. When no such system exists, we work with industry partners and governmental entities to create them. \nIn China, our solar projects produce \nenough energy to power all our offices \nand retail stores in that country. Solar panels are mounted high off the ground to let sunlight shine through, so the grass can grow\u2014and the local yaks  \ncan eat it.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
