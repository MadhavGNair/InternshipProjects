And more \nfrom old devices.\nOur newest disassembly robot, Daisy, is the most innovative and efficient \nway to reclaim more of the valuable materials stored in iPhone. Existing \ntechniques, such as shredding, recover only a few kinds of materials and \noften diminish their quality. Daisy can take apart up to 200 iPhone devices \nper hour, removing and sorting components, so we can recover materials \nthat traditional recyclers can\u2019t\u2014and at a higher quality. By meticulously \ndisassembling our products, we can direct components and materials to \nthose recyclers who can recover what\u2018s important. These materials will then \nbe sent back into secondary materials markets\u2014closing the loop on these \nmaterials and reducing the need to mine more resources from the\u00a0earth.\nDaisy builds upon the learnings from Liam, our R&D experiment in \nautomated disassembly that we announced in 2016. We created Daisy  \nto have a smaller footprint and the capability to disassemble multiple models of iPhone with higher variation compared to Liam.
