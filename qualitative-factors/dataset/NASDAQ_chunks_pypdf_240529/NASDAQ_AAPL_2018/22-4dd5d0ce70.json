{"page_content": "23\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017\nOur intention is to install Daisy in multiple locations around the world\u2014  \nstarting with the United States and Europe. Daisy will process end-of-life  \niPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s,  \niPhone\u00a06s Plus, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus devices that are returned to  \nus by customers or via AppleCare. The program\u2019s success depends in  \npart on customers returning their end-of-life devices to Apple, so we are \nlaunching Apple GiveBack to make it easier for them to do so. \nA durable device is a greener device. \nWhen products can be used longer, fewer resources need to be extracted \nfrom the earth to make new ones. So we assess all our products in our \nReliability Testing Lab, using rigorous testing methods that simulate \ncustomers\u2019 experiences with their devices. For example, we analyze how \ndevices stand up to extreme heat and cold, exposure to water and everyday \nchemicals, and scratch tests from materials like denim and metal coins. All \nnew materials, including recycled materials, are tested extensively to make \nsure they meet our performance and durability standards. If a product does \nrequire repair, Apple and its authorized service providers provide repair \nservices and parts for five years after the product is no longer manufactured - or longer where required by law. \nIn our Reliability Testing Lab, one of \nthe tests uses a weighted pendulum that simulates a swinging arm hitting Apple\u00a0Watch against a hard object.
