As \nof January 2018, approximately 66 percent of the renewable energy Apple \nprocures comes from projects that Apple created. And we aim to ultimately \ncover our entire electricity load with Apple-created projects, which include:\n\u2022 Direct ownership. Where feasible, we produce our own renewable energy \nby building our own renewable energy projects, including solar arrays,  \nwind farms, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro generation systems. \n\u2022 Dedicated renewable energy contracts.  Where it\u2019s not feasible to build \nour own generation, we sign long-term renewable energy purchase \ncontracts, supporting new, local projects that meet our robust renewable \nenergy sourcing principles. \nIn cases where we need more renewable energy than what\u2019s generated by our Apple-created projects, we directly purchase renewable energy \nfrom newer projects in nearby markets, or through available utility green \nenergy programs. When these options are not available, we are willing to \nprocure strong renewable energy credits (RECs) tied to recently constructed \nrenewable energy projects, applying the same rigor to these purchases as we do to our Apple-created renewables. When Apple acquires RECs, we require \nthat they are Green-e Energy certified, where available, and come from the \nsame power grid\u2014and preferably in the same state or country\u2014as the Apple \nfacility they support.\nWind Low-impact  \nhydroBiogas fuel \ncellSolar", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
