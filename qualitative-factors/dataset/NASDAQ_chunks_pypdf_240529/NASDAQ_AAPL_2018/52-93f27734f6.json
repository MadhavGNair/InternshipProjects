We hit this milestone in January 2013, when we began serving the \ndata center with energy sourced primarily from California wind power. We\u2019re \nacquiring this energy directly from the wholesale market through California\u2019s \nDirect Access program. Late in 2017, Apple\u2019s 130-megawatt California Flats \nsolar project in Monterey County, California, came online, and now we use \nDirect Access to supply power from that project directly to our data center \nas well as other Apple facilities in California. \nIn fiscal year 2017, the Newark data center was supported by projects  \nthat generated 118 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, which is \nequivalent to the energy used by 17,976 California homes.26\nNewark, California\u2014100% renewable since opening January 2013\n118 million kWh energy use in fiscal year 2017\nPacific Gas & Electric Default Grid Mix Apple Actual Renewable Energy Use\nNatural Gas 17% Bundled Grid (mostly wind) 91%\nNuclear 24% Grid (mostly wind) 9%\nOther/Unspecified 26%\nRenewable 33%\n2017 Default Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)23,300 2017 Effective Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)0\nwww.energy.ca.gov/pcl/labels/2016_labels/  \nPacific_Gas__and__Electric.pdf (From September 2017)Actual fiscal year 2017 energy dataWindSolar + Biogas fuel cells", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 52, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
