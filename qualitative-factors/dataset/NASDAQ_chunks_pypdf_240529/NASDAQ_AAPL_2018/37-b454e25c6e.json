The standards we set for our suppliers go far beyond \nwhat\u2019s required by law, like our Regulated Substances Specification \n(RSS) list, which identifies the toxic chemicals we limit or prohibit in our \nmanufacturing processes and products. \nWe launched a Chemical Management Program in 2014 to help suppliers \ndevelop a comprehensive approach to managing chemicals safely. The \nprogram has grown to 113 participating supplier facilities, and focuses  \non shifting to safer chemicals and improving general safety, awareness,  \nand training. \nTo better understand the opportunities for greener alternatives, in 2017 we \nmapped the chemicals used in our final assembly facilities and evaluated \nall control measures, such as ventilation, personal protective equipment, \nand worker training programs. The mapping resulted in the identification \nof harmful substances from cleaners at final assembly sites. Hazardous \nchemicals such as methanol, xylene, cyclohexane, acetone, and methyl \nethyl\u00a0ketone were replaced with safer alternatives including ethanol, \nisopropyl alcohol, glycerol, and water. We\u2019re continuing to work with our \nsuppliers to help them better manage chemicals used in manufacturing.100%\nAt all of our final assembly facilities \nin 2017, 100 percent of all process chemicals complied with Apple\u2019s Regulated Substances Specification.\nFinal assembly facility in  \nShanghai, China.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
