In fiscal year 2017, we sold 216,756,000 iPhone, 43,753,000 iPad, and 19,251,000 Mac devices.\u00b9\nWe also publish individual product environmental reports for all of our \nproducts.

Over time, we have greatly refined our model to include more Apple-specific data instead of industry averages. We \nmade significant modeling changes in FY2016 to improve how we calculate emissions from the integrated circuits in Apple products, which resulted in a decrease in manufacturing emissions. And we make systematic \nchanges each year to reflect changes in global electricity grids. Scope 3 emissions associated with employee commute and business travel are included in the Facilities Environmental Performance Indicators table.\n\u00b3 Carbon emissions associated with our products\u2019 end of life decreased in FY2017, because of changes in methodology to more accurately reflect disposal and recycling practices.\n\u2074 Arsenic is present in minute quantities in some semiconductor devices.\u2075 Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of power cords in India and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates\u00a0replacement.\n\u2076   Apple pr oducts comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances where \ntechnically possible. \n\u2077 While Apple\u2019s phaseout covers the vast majority of products and components,\u00a0recently acquired\u00a0Beddit products and\u00a0some\u00a0older Apple product designs\u00a0may not be fully BFR -fr ee and PVC -fr ee.\nOverview of Apple\u2019s product life cycle carbon assessment (LCA) methodologyApple uses five steps when conducting a product LCA.\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part measurements of the entire product along with data on part production. The measurements help us accurately determine the size and weight of the \ncomponents and materials in the product, while data on manufacturing processes and yield loss during production allows us to account for the impact of manufacturing. The LCA includes accessories, packaging, and units that are repaired and replaced through AppleCare.\n2. To model customer use, we measure the power consumed by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. For the purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and tvOS devices and three years for iOS and watchOS devices. Most Apple products last longer and are passed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner for others to use. More information on our product energy use is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.\n3. To model transportation, we use data collected on shipments of single products and multipack units by land, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials between manufacturing sites; transporting products from manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting products from regional distribution hubs to individual customers; and transporting products from final customers to recycling facilities.\n4. To model recycling, we use material composition data on our products and cover the treatment steps carried out by the recycler to obtain metal, plastic, and glass material streams. Subsequent processing and \nremelting steps are not included, as these are considered stages of production and not end -of- life processing.\n5. After we collect data about production, use, transport, and recycling, we combine it with detailed greenhouse gas emission data. This emission data is based on a combination of Apple-specific and industry-average datasets for material production, manufacturing processes, electricity generation, and transportation. Renewable energy used in the supply chain, initiated by suppliers independently or through the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, are also accounted for. Combining product-specific data with emission data in our LCA tool allows us to compile detailed results for greenhouse gas emissions as they relate to the product. The data and modeling approaches are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
