And we continue to make \nadvancements in our products\u2019 efficiency. For example, iMac consumes  \nup to 96 percent less energy in sleep mode than the first generation.  \nThe 12-inch\u00a0MacBook uses less than 0.5\u00a0watt in sleep mode. And  \nyou can charge your iPhone X once a day for a year for only 75 cents.12  \nWhen you multiply these reductions by all the Apple devices in the  \nworld, the impact on our carbon footprint really adds up.Product energy use (kWh/yr)\nOver time, the average energy \nour products use compared with previous generations has declined.\n61%\nMacBook Pro consumes 61 percent  \nless energy than the original MacBook\u00a0Pro\u00a0with Retina display.\n13\n 96%\niMac consumes up to 96 percent  \nless energy in sleep mode than  \nthe first generation.40% \niMac Pro consumes 40 percent  \nless power during sleep and off  \nmode\u2014the result of an innovation  \nin power supply design.14 \n 9 watts\nWhen playing music, HomePod  \nconsumes less power than an  \naverage LED lightbulb.15\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n201723.224.2\n21.8\n17.7\n14.6\n11.2\n8.48.8\n7.2 7.0", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
