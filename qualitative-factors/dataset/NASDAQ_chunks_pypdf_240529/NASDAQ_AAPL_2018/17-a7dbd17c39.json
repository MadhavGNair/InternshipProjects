{"page_content": "18\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017\nProduct Transportation/End of Life\nWe take responsibility for the energy \nused to ship and recycle our products.\nWe include all the energy used for shipping and recycling in our carbon \nfootprint. So we strive to make our packaging smaller or lighter so less \nfuel is consumed when we transport products by air and sea. We\u2019re also \nadjusting our recycling practices. When collecting end-of-life products, \nwe\u00a0maximize the environmental benefits of recycling by weighing the \navailability of recovery technology with the impacts of shipping materials.\nThe packaging for the 13-inch MacBook\u00a0Pro with Touch Bar weighs 19 percent less \nthan the previous generation. By designing our packaging to be lighter, we reduce emissions from shipping.\n16", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
