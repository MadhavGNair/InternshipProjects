As is typical, these emissions are tracked separately from our 100% renewable energy claim. Starting in FY2016,  \nScope\u00a01 emissions capture diesel use in emergency backup generators and propane gas use in corporate offices. Scope 1 emissions are calculated using emissions factors from EPA clean energy website  \nhttps://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/center-corporate-climate-leadership-ghg-emission-factors-hub .\nScope 2 emissions result from electricity use for Apple\u2018s facilities, calculated using a market-based approach, following the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\u00b9   Apple also calculat es what our emissions would have been had we not taken action to supply new, clean renewable energy to our facilities. If we remove the emissions reduction benefits of our renewable energy  \nprogram, then our Scope 1 emissions in FY2017 would have been 70,780 metric tons CO\u2082e and our Scope 2 emissions would have been 589,000 CO\u2082e for our corporate operations, data centers, and retail stores. In\u00a0FY2017, combustion of biogas for our fuel cells resulted in 36,220 metric tons of direct CO\u2082 emissions. These emissions are not counted in Apple\u2018s footprint because they would have occurred naturally even if we had not combusted the biogas.\n\u00b2   In FY 2016, we began tracking electricity used at colocation facilities as part of Apple\u2018s footprint. We\u2018ve updated our FY2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple\u2018s operational boundaries.  \nPer the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we\u2018ve removed from our Scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations. This energy use, however, is still covered by renewable energy. As a result, these Scope 3 effective emissions from this energy use was 550 metric tons CO\u2082e in FY2016, and 500 metric tons in FY2017.\n\u00b3  Emissions from R&D processes.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 49, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
