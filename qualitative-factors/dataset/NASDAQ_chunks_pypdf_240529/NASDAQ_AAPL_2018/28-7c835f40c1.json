{"page_content": "29\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017\nWaste \nWe\u2019re finding new ways to keep old \nmaterials out of landfills.\nWe\u2019re committed to making sure all the waste created by our own facilities \nand in our supply chain is reused, recycled, composted, or when necessary, \nconverted into energy. Reaching this goal requires collaboration among \nmultiple Apple teams, local governments, and specialty recyclers, but \nwe\u2019ve already seen great success. In 2015, our facility in Cork, Ireland, \nwas the first outside North America to receive UL\u2019s Zero Waste to Landfill \ncertification.19 In addition, 22\u00a0supplier facilities\u2014including all iPhone final \nassembly sites\u2014have received UL\u2019s Zero Waste to Landfill certification, diverting more than 625,000 metric tons of waste from landfills since \nJanuary 2015. \nWhen first launching our Zero Waste Program for suppliers in 2015, we \nfocused our efforts on final assembly sites in China, where most in-process \npackaging waste was being generated in our supply chain. Since those \nfacilities have all achieved Zero Waste to Landfill certification, we\u2019ve \nexpanded our efforts to include more upstream suppliers. To date, we\u2019ve \nengaged 71 supplier sites. To help our suppliers divert all waste from landfills, Apple provides necessary tools and guidance, including the \nservices of experts in sustainable waste management.\nIn 2017, 22 supplier facilities were \ncertified as Zero Waste, including all \nour iPhone final assembly sites.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
