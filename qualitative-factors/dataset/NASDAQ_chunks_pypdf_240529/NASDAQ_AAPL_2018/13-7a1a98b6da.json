{"page_content": "14\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017\nWe aim to promote continual improvement, build technical capabilities,  \nand increase awareness of the environmental and financial benefits of \nenergy efficiency. \nSince the inception of this program in 2015, we have engaged with \n48\u00a0suppliers at 71 facilities. In 2017, our program implemented energy \nefficiency measures that saved a combined annualized $44.8 million. \nThese\u00a0measures helped save\u00a0an annualized 320,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e \nfrom entering the\u00a0atmosphere in 2017.\nOur efforts go beyond energy efficiency to spur the development and \nprocurement of renewable energy within our global supply chain. Partners across our supply chain are installing or investing in sizable solar projects, \nrunning their factories on 100 percent wind power, and purchasing \nclean energy from reputable utility\u00a0programs. We\u2019ve also helped develop \n485\u00a0megawatts of wind and solar projects to address upstream emissions. \nAs part of our clean energy program, Apple and our suppliers will generate \nand procure more than\u00a04 gigawatts of new clean power worldwide by 2020. \nOnce completed, this will represent approximately one-third of our current \nmanufacturing carbon footprint.4 gigawatts = one-third of our    \nmanufacturing emissions\nBy 2020, Apple and our suppliers will \ngenerate or procure 4 gigawatts of clean energy in our supply chain.  \nThat\u2019s approximately one-third of our current manufacturing footprint.\nOur partner Compal, which assembles \niPad devices, is constructing rooftop solar on its facilities across China. By the end of 2018, it will achieve its goal of 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
