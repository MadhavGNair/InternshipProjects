{"page_content": "34\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017\nApple Park\u2014our new headquarters in Cupertino\u2014is the latest example \nof this commitment. The building is on track to be the largest LEED \nPlatinum\u2013certified office building in North America. It\u2019s powered by \n100\u00a0percent renewable energy, 75 percent of which is generated onsite \nby a 17-megawatt rooftop solar installation and 4 megawatts of baseload \nbiogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is drawn from the \nnearby California Flats Solar Project. When the building has less use\u2014on \nweekends, for example\u2014it will generate renewable energy that\u2019s delivered \nto the public grid. Over 80 percent of the new campus is open space with \nmore than 9000 drought-tolerant trees. Most are oak, and many are shade \nand fruit trees.\nAt our retail stores, we also apply green building principles. Our new  \nback-of-house design is anticipated to reduce our water use by 30 percent \nand our energy load by 40 percent. And whenever possible, we\u2019re bringing \nthe outside in, through mixed-mode natural ventilation, and biophilic design, \nin addition to installing rooftop solar systems where conditions allow.\nWe\u2019ve planted more than 9000 \ndrought-resistant trees at our new campus in Cupertino. We selected many tree varieties native to the area as well as others that could thrive in a range of climate change scenarios.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
