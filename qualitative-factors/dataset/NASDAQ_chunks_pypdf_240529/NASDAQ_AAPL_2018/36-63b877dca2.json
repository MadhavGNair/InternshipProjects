{"page_content": "37\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017To understand the safety of our materials more comprehensively,\u00a0we started \nour Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program to identify all the substances  \nin all the parts in all our products. So far, we\u2019ve collected the composition  \nof more than 25,000 individual components out of the 50,000 present in our \nproducts, and we get data on more parts every day. We\u2019ve also collected \nFMDs covering over half of the mass of iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and  \niPhone X. We\u2019re prioritizing materials with the greatest risks, such as those used in high quantities or those with the greatest human exposure. \nWe apply our most rigorous controls to the materials that are in prolonged \nskin contact. Our toxicologists review results from our testing and use FMDs to generate comprehensive hazard and risk assessments including \nGreenScreen\u00ae, which considers 18\u00a0different criteria to help us understand the \nmaterials\u2018 effect on people\u2019s health and on the\u00a0environment. Only materials \nthat pass our rigorous review process are accepted for our products.\nSince we built our own Environmental \nTesting Lab in 2006, we\u2019ve grown it to \nover 30 times its original size.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
