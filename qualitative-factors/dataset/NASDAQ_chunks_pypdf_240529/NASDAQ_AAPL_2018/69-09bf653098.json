The scope of the comprehensive \nfiber footprint includes Apple\u2019s fiber usage from products, corporate, and retail operations. \nThe comprehensive fiber footprint tracks the total amount of wood, bamboo, and bagasse fiber, both virgin and recycled, that Apple uses in packaging (\u201cPackaging Fiber\u201d), and other \npaper products such as retail bags, photo books and non-product related corporate use \n(\u201cCorporate Fiber\u201d).  \nApple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and sums up these \nfigures for the entire company using sell-in numbers. The output is a total fiber footprint.  \nData reported by Apple is as follows: \n  Total Fiber Virgin Fiber Recycled Fiber \n2017 Packaging Fiber  145,000  51,000  94,000  \nCorporate Fiber 3,000 1,000 2,000 \nTotal  148,000 52,000 96,000 \n [metric tons fiber] [metric tons fiber] [metric tons fiber] \n \nThe review of the comprehensive annual fiber footprint has considered the following \ncriteria: \n\uf0a7The system boundaries are clearly defined ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 69, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
