At our headquarters in Santa Clara Valley, \nwe helped extend the City of Sunnyvale\u2019s recycled water system to our \nnew\u00a0Apple Park campus and to another new campus set to open in  \nmid-2018. Between both campuses, use of this recycled water will replace over\u00a030\u00a0million gallons of potable freshwater. We are also capturing \nrainwater for cooling, irrigation, and construction needs at our Maiden \ndata\u00a0center, and for our corporate offices in Cork, Ireland; Austin, Texas; and Yokohama Japan. \nPursuing water stewardship. \nWe\u2018re looking to restore water resources in the most critical regions in which we operate. For example, our Southern California retail stores make up the majority of our highly stressed water use in retail. Though our \nnew back-of-house design will minimize water use, we still face risk from \npoor overall health of the watershed. So we partnered with Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) to help fund WAYS Park, a project led \nby Heal the Bay in South Los Angeles. The park will collect and filter \nstormwater runoff from 9 acres surrounding the site\u2014delivering water \nquality benefits and groundwater recharge to the Los Angeles River \nWatershed, as well as recreational benefits to an underserved community.\nGreen Buildings\nDesigning our buildings with the planet  \nin mind.\nWe want our commitment to the environment to show in everything we  \ndo\u2014not just in our products, but at the offices where our employees \nwork, in the services that our customers use, and in the spaces where \nour customers shop. We actively apply green building principles to all \nof our office, data center, and retail store projects. This means we\u2019re \ncreating these spaces to be environmentally responsible and use resources \nefficiently. For most projects, we are able to meet the U.S. Green Building \nCouncil\u2019s LEED Gold requirements, and sometimes LEED Platinum\u2014the \nhighest level. \nWhether we\u2019re building a new facility or renovating an already occupied \none, we also think about enhancements that improve the general well \nbeing of our employees\u2014such as inviting outdoor spaces. In addition, we proactively provide a high percentage of EV charging stations to all our \ncorporate campuses, offer a comprehensive commute program, and utilize \ngreen cleaning and pest control products.24 million\nWe used 24 million gallons of recycled \nwater and captured rainwater in 2017.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
