These efforts also remove toxins from our manufacturing  \nand recycling processes, which protects the people who make and take apart our products and keeps pollutants out of the land, air, and\u00a0water.\nBeryllium\nEliminated from all new product designs. Beryllium is found in copper alloys used to make connectors and springs.MercuryEliminated in\u00a02009.
