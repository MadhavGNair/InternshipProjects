Beginning January 2018, it is at 100%. \n\u2074   Ov er the past two years, we have been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in FY2016, we \nstarted reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based \non maximum contract capacity quantities. We\u2019ve updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple\u2019s operational boundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we\u2018ve removed from our electricity usage and Scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations. This energy use, however, is still covered by renewable energy.\nRegional Energy Use at Apple\u2019s Colocation Facilities  \n(Fiscal Year 2017)  \nTotal Energy Use\n(kWh)Renewable Energy(kWh)Percent  \nRenewable Energy*\nU.S. 228,114,700 228,014,600 100%\nEurope 23,355,300 20,637,700 88%\nAPAC 37,725,800 37,725,800 100%\nFY2017 Total 289,195,800 286,378,100 99%\n* W e calculate our progress toward our 100 percent renewable energy goal on a calendar year basis.
