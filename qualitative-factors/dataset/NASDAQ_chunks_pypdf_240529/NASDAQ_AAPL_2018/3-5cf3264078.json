{"page_content": "4\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2018 Progress Report, Covering FY2017As we worked to reach 100 percent renewable energy for our own \noperations, we began to challenge our suppliers to make the same \ntransition to clean energy through our supplier clean energy program. \nAs of April 2018, 23 manufacturers have committed to power all of \ntheir\u00a0Apple operations with 100 percent renewable energy. And we\u2019re \nwell on our way to meeting our goal of putting 4 gigawatts of new \nclean\u00a0energy online in our supply chain by 2020.\nWe also made progress toward our goal to one day make new products \nwithout mining new materials from the earth. We hope to get there by \nusing only recycled or renewable materials in our products, and returning an equivalent amount of material back to the market, to be used by us \nor\u00a0others. \nLike everything at Apple, this effort is driven by innovation. We\u2019ve \ndeveloped a brand-new robot, Daisy, capable of disassembling nine \nversions of iPhone, and sorting their high-quality components for \nrecycling. To help keep Daisy busy, we\u2019re making it easier than ever \nfor\u00a0customers to recycle their old Apple devices through our new \nApple\u00a0GiveBack experience. \nThere\u2019s a lot more to our story over the past year. As you read through \nthis Environmental Progress Report, we are busy working toward our  \nnext frontiers in clean energy, materials recovery, and green chemistry. We are proud of our work and look forward to continuing our journey. \nLisa Jackson  \nVice President, Environment, Policy & Social Initiatives", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
