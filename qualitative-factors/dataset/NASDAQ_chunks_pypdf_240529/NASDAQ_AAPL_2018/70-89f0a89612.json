Where appropriate, this approach \nfollows methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments. \nPlausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail. \nCorrections were made accordingly.This review was done remotely. All questions raised in \nthe course of the review were answered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.   \nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the \ncomprehensive fiber footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of \nfiber data and information. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific \npractice.    \n \nBerlin, April 5, 2018 \n  \n  \n- Marina Proske -  - Karsten Schischke - \nFraunhofer IZM  Fraunhofer IZM \nDept.
