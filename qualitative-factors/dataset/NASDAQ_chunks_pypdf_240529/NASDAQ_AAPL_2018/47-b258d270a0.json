We \nestimate natural gas usage in offices and retail stores where we are not billed based on usage (e.g., \nleased office space or retail stores within malls). This more accurate methodology resulted in a \ndecrease in emissions in FY2015.\n\u2074 Emissions from R&D processes. We started tracking these emissions in FY2017.\n\u2075   W e\u2019ve updated our FY2016 colocation facilities footprint to reflect more accurately Apple\u2019s operational \nboundaries. Per the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we\u2019ve removed from our Scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations. This energy use, however, is still covered by renewable energy. As a result, these effective Scope 3 emissions from this energy use was 550 metric tons CO\u2082e in FY2016, and 500 metric tons in FY2017.\n\u2076  In FY 2017, we started calculating Scope 3 emissions not listed above. These include electricity \ntransmission and distribution losses (22,300 metric tons CO\u2082e) and lifecycle emissions associated with renewable energy (46,400 metric tons CO\u2082e).\u2077  W e adjusted our methodology for FY2017 to take into account Apple\u2019s \u201cAt Home Advisors\u201d Program, \nwhere employees work remotely.\n\u2078 Only t otal electricity usage data was available for FY2012. \n\u2079 Because ener gy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated \ncumulatively since 2011. All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the California Energy Commission. \n\u00b9\u2070We calculate our progress toward 100 percent renewable energy on a calendar year basis. Beginning \nJanuary 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our global facilities is sourced from renewable energy. \n\u00b9\u00b9Beginning in FY2017, \u201cData Centers\u201d includes water use at colocation facilities, and \u201cCorporate\u201d includes \nwater use at Apple distribution centers.\n\u00b9\u00b2Beginning in FY2017, we\u2019re including waste from Apple\u2019s distribution centers. Prior to FY2015, \ncomposted quantities were reported as part of the \u201crecycled\u201d figure. Beginning in FY2017, waste \nprocessed in \u201cWaste to Energy\u201d facilities is reported separately.
