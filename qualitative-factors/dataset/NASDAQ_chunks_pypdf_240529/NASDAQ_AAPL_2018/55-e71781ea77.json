To support this facility, we partnered with the local utility, the \nSalt River Project, to build the 50-megawatt Bonnybrooke solar array, which \nbecame operational in December 2016. This project produces over 147\u00a0million \nkilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy a year, which more than fully \nmatches the energy used by the data center. \nIn fiscal year 2017, the Mesa data center was supported by 45 million \nkilowatt-hours of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used \nby 3,640 Arizona homes.26\nMesa Arizona\u2014100% renewable since opening March 2017*\n45 million kWh energy use in fiscal year 2017\nSalt River Project (SRP)  \nDefault Grid MixApple Actual Renewable Energy Use\nCoal 53% Apple\u2018s Solar PV Project 93%\nNuclear 18% SRP Solar PV Purchase 7%\nNatural Gas / Other 17%\nRenewable 12%\n2017 Default Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)21,630 2017 Effective Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)0\nwww.srpnet.com/about/stations/pdfx/2014irp.pdf Actual fiscal year 2017 energy data\n*Apple took operational control of the building in October 2015 and converted it to a data center that began servicing customers in \nMarch 2017\nViborg, Denmark \nWe\u2019re currently constructing a new data center running on 100 percent \nrenewable energy in Denmark\u2019s central Jutland region.
