But when virgin paper is needed \nin our packaging, we require our suppliers to source it from sustainably \nmanaged forests or FSC controlled wood sources.17 In 2017, all of our \npackaging suppliers sourced their paper responsibly. And we conduct regular audits to ensure their claims.\nOur corporate office paper use\u2014which includes printing paper, paper \ntowels, and toilet paper\u2014represented less than 2 percent of our total fiber \nfootprint. In fiscal year 2017, approximately 80 percent of our corporate \npaper use was from recycled sources or sustainably managed forests.  \nAnd in some of our offices in China, we\u2019re sourcing paper from one of  \nthe sustainably managed forests created in partnership with World Wildlife \nFund (WWF).\nProtecting sustainable forests.\nIn addition to specifying that all of our virgin fiber be sourced responsibly, we also wanted to make sure we weren\u2019t diminishing\u00a0the world\u2019s\u00a0supply of \nresponsible\u00a0paper. So we set a goal to protect or create enough sustainably \nmanaged\u00a0forests\u00a0to cover all of our\u00a0product\u00a0packaging needs.\n18\u00a0For \nthe second consecutive year, production from our forest conservation \nprojects exceeded the amount of virgin fiber we use in Apple\u2019s\u00a0product \npackaging.\u00a0As our paper demands grow and change, we will continue \nprotecting and creating enough sustainably managed forests to\u00a0cover all \nour packaging needs.100% \nAll the fiber in our product packaging  \nis now 100% responsibly sourced.\nSustainably managed forest,  \nBrunswick County, North\u00a0Carolina.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
