This review and verification \nfocuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol \u2013 Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard). It is \nnoted that emissions relating to the facilities that are owned or leased by Apple (scope 1 \nand 2 emissions) as well as business travel and emp loyee commute were subject to a \nseparate third party verification and are therefore excluded from the scope of this statement. Confidential data relating to product sales and shipments were also excluded \nfrom the scope of this verification.  \nThis review and verification covers Apple\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not \nreplace reviews conducted for individual product LCAs for greenhouse gas emissions \n(GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been \ncalculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental management \u2013 \nLife cycle assessment \u2013 Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This \nreview and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases -- Part \n3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.  \nThe review of the annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria: \n\uf0a7The system, boundaries and functional unit are clearly defined \n\uf0a7Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate \n\uf0a7Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used \nare adequately disclosed ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 62, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
