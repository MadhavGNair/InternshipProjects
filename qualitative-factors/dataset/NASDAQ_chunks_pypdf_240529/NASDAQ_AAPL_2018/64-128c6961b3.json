The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions: \n\uf0a7Are product LCAs referenced correctly? \n\uf0a7Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible? \n\uf0a7Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of \nmethodological changes as indicated by Apple?  \nThis review was done remotely. \n3 Findings \nSince the FY2016 Carbon Footprint review in early 2017 6 recent product LCA studies have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44.
