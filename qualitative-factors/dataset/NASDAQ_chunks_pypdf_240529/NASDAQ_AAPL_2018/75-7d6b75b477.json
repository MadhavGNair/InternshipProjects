{"page_content": "Report Notes:\n\u2022 This report is published annually and covers fiscal year 2017 activities, unless otherwise noted.\n\u2022  This r eport addresses environmental impacts and activities at Apple-owned facilities (corporate offices, data centers, \nand retail stores), as well as the life cycle impacts of our products, including in the manufacturing, transportation, \nuse, and end-of-life phases.\n\u2022 To provide feedback on this report, please contact environment-report@apple.com . \n 1 The CPU, SOC, DRAM, and memory (NAND) make up the bulk of the integrated circuit emissions.\n 2 \u201cBoar ds and flexes\u201d refers to bare printed circuit boards and flexible printed circuits.\n 3 Int egrated circuits, aluminum, bare boards and flexes, display, and onboard electronics make up 88\u00a0percent \nof manufacturing emissions. The remaining 12\u00a0percent (\u201cOther\u201d) include final assembly facilities, battery cells, steel, glass, plastic, packaging, and other materials (such as copper). These are listed in order of their\u00a0contribution.\n 4 \u201c Onboard electronics\u201d includes capacitors, resistors, transistors, diodes, and other electronic components \nsoldered to bare board and flexes, other than the integrated circuits.\n 5 A ctive: active charging of the battery for iOS devices; active use of the product for all other products.\n 6 Idle:  macOS and AirPort products that are awake, but non-active.\n 7 Sleep:  maintenance charge of the battery for iOS devices; sleep mode for all other products.\n 8 Gr eenhouse gas equivalencies calculated using the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator:  \nwww.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator .\n 9 Includes new renewable energy commitments that are part of Apple\u2019s clean energy program, as well as \nclean\u00a0energy use purchases suppliers have made independently.\n 10 Compar ed to early 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.\n 11 Based on sales weighted averages.\n 12 Calculation assumes one full charge per day, using the US Energy Information Administration average electricity cost in the US for January, 2018.\n 13 Based on typical energy consumption calculations from Energy Star Program Requirements for Computers Version 6.1.\n 14 Compared to a conventional, single-converter power supply design. iMac Pro incorporates a high-efficiency, dual-converter power supply design. \n 15 Based on the average power consumed by A19 LED bulbs listed on the ENERGY STAR Certified Light Bulbs Version 2.0 registry as of March 16, 2018. Average power use across geographic locations is approximately 9\u00a0watts.\n 16 Compared to early 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. Includes retail and shipping box for U.S. configurations.\n 17 For more details on FSC Controlled Wood standards, see Forest Stewardship Council. \u201cFSC Controlled Wood.\u201d 2017. https://ic.fsc.org/en/what-is-fsc-certification/controlled-wood .\n 18 Based on\u00a0expected\u00a0equivalent\u00a0fiber production from\u00a0our\u00a0forestry projects\u00a0and virgin fiber used for Apple product packaging. To determine the output of Apple\u2019s projects, we work with our partners to understand the productive potential of these working forests. The forest management plans required to achieve or maintain certification limit harvest volumes to sustainable levels. We use these potential harvest volumes to estimate the sustainable productive capacity of these forests.\n 19 To achieve a Zero Waste to Landfill validation against the UL 2799 standard, a factory must divert 100\u00a0percent of its waste from landfills, with a maximum of 10 percent sent to a waste-to-energy facility.\n 20 As defined by the WRI Aqueduct tool. We consider \u201celevated risks\u201d to include levels medium-high and above.\n 21 Source: World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct, www.wri.org/our-work/project/aqueduct .\n 22 Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances where technically possible.\n 23 Arsenic is present in minuscule quantities in some semiconductor devices.\n 2 4 Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of power cords in India and South\u00a0Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates\u00a0replacement.\n 25 While Apple\u2019s phaseout covers the vast majority of products and components,\u00a0recently acquired\u00a0Beddit \nproducts and\u00a0some\u00a0older Apple product designs\u00a0may not be fully BFR -fr ee and PVC -fr ee.\n 26 Carbon emissions equivalences calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2016 data:  \nwww.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf .\n \u00a9 2018 Apple Inc.
