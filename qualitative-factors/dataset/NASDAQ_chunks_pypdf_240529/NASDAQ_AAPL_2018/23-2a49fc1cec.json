In many cases, we have deepened our understanding and \nrelationships within our downstream recycling supply chain. And in other \ncases, we\u2019re invested heavily in research to identify closed-loop solutions.\nAluminum. We\u2019ve found that one of the best sources of recycled aluminum \ncomes from our own products and processes. That\u2019s because we specify \nsuch a high grade of the material to make our products strong, durable, \nand beautiful. And today, the only way to keep the aluminum at this quality \nlevel is with a clean material stream\u2014not mixing it with other grades of scrap aluminum, as is typical at recycling facilities. So our challenge is to \nrecover the aluminum from our products and processes without degrading \nits quality. With Liam, Daisy\u2018s predecessor, we found a way to maintain the \noriginal aluminum purity from reclaimed phones post disassembly. So we \ndesigned Daisy to integrate this step.\nCobalt. * We primarily use cobalt in batteries. But it is not consistently \nrecovered, and recycled cobalt is not well tracked in the market. So \nwe\u2019ve implemented a pilot project to ship battery scrap from suppliers \nthat assemble iPhone and Mac in Shanghai to a recycler upstream in Apple\u2019s battery supply chain. We plan to account for this material in a \nway that ensures the cobalt in those batteries is not only recovered and \nrecycled responsibly, but allocated toward production of Apple batteries \nin the future. In addition, we continue to responsibly source cobalt, and \n100\u00a0percent of known cobalt refiners are participating in third-party audits.\nCopper. Copper forms the conductive pathways on printed circuit \nboards, cables, and connectors. In partnership with our suppliers, we are \ninvestigating new methods to manufacture our printed circuit boards that \nwill allow us to reduce the amount of copper needed in the process. And for\u00a0sourcing, we are exploring ways to increase the amount of recycled \ncopper we use for some of our printed circuit board and copper foil \nvendors, and directing in-process materials to recyclers who can integrate \ninto our supply\u00a0chain. \nGlass. We\u2019re working with our cover glass suppliers to ensure that all \nglass scrap generated during the manufacturing process is recycled at \nthe highest level possible. And we are partnering with them to enhance \nin-process reuse and reprocessing in ways not traditionally done in \nthis\u00a0industry. \nPaper. We\u2019ve successfully created a closed-loop supply chain for paper. \nThat means that 100 percent of the wood fibers in our packaging is either \nrecycled or comes from sustainably managed forests or controlled wood \nsources. And we have protected or created enough sustainably managed \nforests to cover all the wood fiber we use in our packaging.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2018.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
