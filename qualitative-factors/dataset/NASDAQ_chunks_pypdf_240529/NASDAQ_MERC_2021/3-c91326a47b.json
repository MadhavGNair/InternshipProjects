{"page_content": "4 5\nMERCER INTERNATIONAL INC. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021In creating Mercer\u2019s first sustainability \nreport, we are guided by a great sense of \nresponsibility. In what follows, we try to \nshare an overview of Mercer\u2019s commitment \nto sustainability in the mills we operate and \nthe forests we manage.\nWe believed it was time to set out for \nstakeholders and others, in this report, \nwhat we mean when we use the word \nsustainability  so that readers would \nbetter understand and perhaps even take \ninspiration from some of what we do. And \nto do that, we had to make tough choices: \nwhat to illuminate in the report and what \nto leave out.\nIt comes down to a matter of balance.\nWe present a lot of data here as a \nmeasure that reflects our commitment \nto sustainability. You\u2019ll see charts, tables \nand graphs on a myriad of technical and \nenvironmental goals: water consumption, \neffluent quality, chemical use and more. \nThe results say a lot about the meaningful \nimpacts we\u2019re trying to make in the forest, \nin the watershed and on our climate.\nWe also express our commitment to \nsustainability through our aspirations: to \ndecarbonize our mills and lower emissions \nintensity, to operate the safest mills in FROM THE VP, SUSTAINABILITY \n& INNOVATION  \nBill \nAdams\nSECTION 1: MESSAGES FROM LEADERSHIPthe industry, to bring more women into \nleadership positions and to further invest \nin technology to realize the maximum value \nfrom the fiber we harvest or purchase.\nWe further express it through stories \nthat describe our actions. For example, \nyou\u2019ll learn about our partnership with \nIndigenous communities in Peace River, \nAlberta, where we are identifying and \nmapping sites in the forests that are sacred \nand meaningful to these communities. It\u2019s a \nshort account, but it speaks volumes about \nwhat we believe and how we behave at all \nour sites.\nAfter much thought from our senior \nleadership team, we organized the \ninformation into the most material topics \nhere at Mercer: continuously improving \nenvironmental performance, mitigating \nclimate change, continuously improving \nresource efficiency, embracing social \nresponsibility, sustainably managing  \nforests and enhancing stakeholder and \nIndigenous engagement.\nWe explore each area through a mix of \ndata, trends, aspirations and stories. \nUnderpinning it all is guidance from the \nstandards and recommendations of the \nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI), the \nTask Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Sustainability \nAccounting Standards Board (SASB). Our \nmetrics, performance and management \napproach relative to these frameworks are \nall included in this report.\nWe know our Mercer team is proud to see \nthe breadth of our sustainability efforts \npresented in this report for the first time. \nWe are excited to share a key milestone \non our net-zero pathway as Mercer is the \nfirst forest products company in Canada to \nhave our climate targets validated by the \nScience Based Targets initiative. We hope \nour customers and stakeholders recognize \nus as an organization that aligns with their \naspirations and hopes for our forests, rivers, \nclimate and an inclusive society.\nAbove all, we hope it\u2019s an engaging and \nbalanced look at an organization striving to \ndo the right thing every day.\nBill Adams  \nVice-President of Sustainability  \nand InnovationAs it does every day \nin the forests we \nmanage and the mills \nwe operate, it comes \ndown to a matter \nof balance. In what \nfollows, we try to share \na brief but accurate \nlook at what we \nbelieve to be true about \nMercer\u2019s commitment to \nsustainability.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MERC_2021.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
