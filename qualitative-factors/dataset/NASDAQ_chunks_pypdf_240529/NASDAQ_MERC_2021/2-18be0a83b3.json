{"page_content": "2 3\nMERCER INTERNATIONAL INC. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021If one theme were to define Mercer and \nour people in 2021, it would be resilience, \na word that embodies the strength and \ncapacity of our people to learn, adapt, \npivot and continue safely operating \nthrough a year with evolving challenges. \nWe know that challenges will always be \npresent, but adapting well in the face of \nadversity has enabled us to continue to \nmove intentionally towards our goals.\nTo be sustainable, we look beyond the \nability to meet our present needs and \nconsider the ability of future generations \nto meet their own needs. It\u2019s a commitment \nto manage and operate our business, \nincluding the natural resources under \nour care or direction, with a long-term \nview. We believe by doing so we will be \nable to deliver value to our customers, \nemployees, shareholders, communities \nand other stakeholders.FROM THE PRESIDENT & CEO  \nDavid  \nGandossi\nSECTION 1: MESSAGES FROM LEADERSHIPTogether, we successfully faced a global \npandemic with a commitment to health \nand well-being and one underlying \nmessage: stay safe. The keyword here \nisn\u2019t  safety , though that is paramount \nto Mercer. It isn\u2019t even expenditures  \nor capital , though those are crucial \nconsiderations as we seek long-term value \nfor our shareholders. It\u2019s commitment .\nElsewhere in this report \u2014 our first \ncomprehensive sustainability report \n\u2014 you\u2019ll see my colleagues use words \nlike care and responsibility  and balance  to \ndefine what we believe are the  \nkey drivers in all of our operations, \nenhancing our decision-making, our \nbusiness and our relationships with \nour various stakeholders and the \ncommunities in which we operate. We \nbelieve our commitments to all of the \nforegoing elements are interconnected \nand vital to our long-term future, success \nand sustainability.It\u2019s a commitment that those decisions \ncan reduce our carbon footprint, boost \nfinancial performance, maximize the \nvalue of fiber from the forest, reduce  \nour chemical and water use, and  \nprepare us for replacing fossil fuels  \nwith greener options on our road to  \nnet-zero carbon emissions.\nWe believe that by caring for the health \nand safety of our workers, maintaining \nthe environmental quality of our \noperations and being part of and actively \nengaged in the communities, we provide \nvalue for all of our stakeholders. We work \nto build all of these values and goals into \nour corporate culture, which we refer to \nas \u201cthe Mercer Way.\u201dFor me, it\u2019s about showing our commitment to sustainability, in all the \nways that concept impacts our company, our people and our planet.\nAs we say in these pages, it\u2019s about our \ncommitment today to ensure we are  \nfit for future. We\u2019ve accomplished a lot  \nin recent years and we have much \njustifiable pride, but we\u2019re not finished. \nWhat we do every day shows the value of \nMercer\u2019s commitment.\nDavid Gandossi  \nPresident and CEO\nFor information and a description of, among \nother things, our business, operations, including \nour mills, human resources, results of operations, \ncapital expenditures, innovations, human resources, \nclimate change and the risk factors we face, \nplease see our annual report on Form 10-K for the \nfiscal year ended December 3 1, 202 1, and filed \nFebruary 17 , 2022, a copy of which is available \non our corporate website, www.mercerint.com , \nand on the United States Securities and Exchange \nCommission\u2019s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis \nand Retrieval system: www.sec.gov/edgar/\nbrowse/?CIK=000133327 4 .\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MERC_2021.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
