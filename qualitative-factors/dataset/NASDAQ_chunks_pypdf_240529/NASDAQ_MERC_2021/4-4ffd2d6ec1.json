{"page_content": "7\nMERCER INTERNATIONAL INC. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 6For more than 30 years, I\u2019ve been \nfortunate to have a front-row seat as the \nforest products industry has evolved. \nMuch has changed in that time, but one \nthing has remained constant: it\u2019s a tough \nindustry. It was tough when I started as \na young mechanical engineering grad, \nand it\u2019s tough today. Those who come \nto work each day are challenged by \nMother Nature, noisy mills and the high \nexpectations of everyone, including their \nlocal communities and those who strive \nfor a sustainable world.\nAt Mercer, I witness everyone rallying to \nmeet those challenges because we care.\nTough  and care might seem mutually \nexclusive, but they certainly are not at \nMercer. Care is at the heart of everything \nwe do, and I hope that notion rings \nthrough these pages.\nIt starts with caring for the forests and \nhow we harvest them, get logs and \nchips to our mills and extract the most \nproductive fiber possible while reducing \nour impact on climate change. It\u2019s a FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  \nJim  \nShepherd  \nSECTION 1: MESSAGES FROM LEADERSHIPprivilege to work in these forests, in \nCanada and Germany, and so we should \ncare for them as the meaningful resources \nthat underpin all of our business.\nMost organizations demonstrate care, \nparticularly for their employees. But \nI\u2019ve seen few organizations bring such \ncaring into their business as forcefully \nand comprehensively as Mercer does. In \nparticular, our executive, led by David \nGandossi, has made the safety of our \nteams a primary focus of their leadership.A root of sustainability is insisting that \na safety-first mindset is non-negotiable. \nThis is how we can sustain excellence \nand trust among employees. In addition, \nit fosters a culture of caring from the \nboardroom to the shop floor.\nOf course, we also care about our \ninvestors and the value we bring to \nthem. We are fortunate at Mercer \nto have a stable shareholder base of \nthoughtful people who are mindful of \nthe balance between profitability and the \nneed for long-term sustainability. They \nunderstand how our business is affected \nby the relationships between the forest, \nour customers, partners, Indigenous \npeoples and our global workforce.\nSustainability reports like this are an \nimportant vehicle to show stakeholders \nwhat we mean when we say that we care. \nThis is through a record of our actions in \nthe forest, in the relationships we build \nwith customers and partners, and in Tough  and care  \nmight seem mutually \nexclusive, but they \ncertainly are not at \nMercer. Care is at the \nheart of everything \nMercer does, and I \nhope that notion rings \nthroughout these pages.the stronger workplace we are creating \nthrough our commitment to diversity, \nequity and inclusion.\nThe essential thing about caring is that \nit\u2019s impossible to stop once you start. \nIt endures, and I can see how caring \ndrives this team I admire at Mercer to \nimprove continuously. I hope you see it, \ntoo, in the numerous stories revealed \nthroughout this report.\nJim Shepherd  \nDirector  \nJim Shepherd chairs Mercer\u2019s Environmental, \nHealth and Safety Committee, and has served as \nPresident of Canfor Corporation, Slocan Forest \nProducts Ltd., Crestbrook Forest Industries Ltd. and \nFinlay Forest Industries Ltd.
