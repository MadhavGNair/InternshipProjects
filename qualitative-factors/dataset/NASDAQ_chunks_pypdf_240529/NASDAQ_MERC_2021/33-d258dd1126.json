SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021Crucially, research shows that water \nquality, soil integrity and wildlife activity \nin these carefully harvested stands are far \nhealthier than following the old clear-\ncut method. We document projects like \nEMEND and our broader intentions to harvest the bigger forest management area \nin formalized 1-, 5-, 10- and 20-year plans. \nWe then share our documentation with a \nlocal public advisory council for feedback.\nSECTION 7: SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENTEcosystem-based management (EBM) \nis an approach that strives to emulate \nnatural disturbance levels and patterns \nto maintain the functions of ecosystems \nwith a more natural outcome. The EBM \napproach emulates natural disturbances \nby achieving the following goals:\n\u2022  Ensure  that some area of each \nforest stand that we have today is \nmaintained on the landscape.\n\u2022  Maintain  variability across the \nlandscape by following natural sizes \nand shapes to create disturbances like \nyou would see following fires.\n\u2022  Leave  variable amounts of mature \ntrees standing in the harvest areas as \nretention in big and small patches as \nwell as single trees and clumps.\n\u2022  Protect special, unique, high-value \nfeatures when they are found, such as \nbear dens, wolverine dens, and birds \nof prey nesting sites, to name a few.\nAs part of our EBM method at Mercer \nPeace River, blocks are planned and \nharvested in line with existing stand \nboundaries to provide a wide range of Ecosystem-Based \nManagement\nopening sizes and shapes for a more \nnatural mix of openings on the landscape. \nIn addition, the companies operating \non the blocks also leave a portion of \nlive, good-quality trees unharvested. \nThis \u201cretention\u201d is left as an additive \nmeasure to reflect what occurs in natural \ndisturbances.\nThe combination of variable retention \ntogether with harvests that follow natural \ndisturbance patterns is believed to have \nnumerous benefits for wildlife, travel \ncorridors, biodiversity and aesthetics, \nto name just a few. To test these forest \npractices, Mercer, the government \nof Alberta and a wide range of other \nparticipating companies and research \nagencies worked together to establish a \nresearch program called EMEND.\nEMEND \u2014 A New Approach\nEMEND (Ecosystem Management \nEmulating Natural Disturbance) \nis perhaps one of Mercer\u2019s most \nextensive initiatives. In partnership \nwith the University of Alberta and the \ngovernment of Alberta, we have joined \nwith other forest companies to research \nand harvest blocks of boreal forest in a new way for nearly three decades \nto show how science and progressive \nthinking will sustain the resource for \ngenerations to come.\nWe try to emulate natural disturbances \nin EMEND\u2019s experimental harvest areas \nwhen deciding which trees to harvest. Decades ago, the industry would clear-cut \nsections, leaving a patchwork of denuded \nsquares alongside the healthy forest. \nNow, we leave behind varied shapes and \nsizes of living tree blocks, mirroring how \na fire might affect the forest.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MERC_2021.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
