{"page_content": "56 57MERCER  \nLEADERSHIP  \nPROGRAMS\nWe believe that strong leaders build an \neven more robust, innovative workforce with \nmentorship and coaching. Therefore, we \nhave the Mercer Leadership Program (MLP) \nto support those who aspire to achieve a \nleadership role.\nMercer utilizes the SGMI Institute of \nManagement St. Gallen. One of the most \nrenowned international business schools \nin the world, SGMI employs demanding, \npractice-oriented management-development \napproaches. It provides personal and reflective \napproaches to leadership and decision-making \nthat characterize all great leaders. The MLP is \nabout growth and enhancing an individual\u2019s \nleadership skill set.COVID-19\nCOVID-19 has been particularly challenging \nfor us, given the breadth of our operations \nin Europe and North America. However, we \nresponded with one ultimate, crucial goal in \nmind: to keep our employees, contractors and \ncommunities safe.\nOur senior management team actively \nevaluated the COVID-19 threat and quickly \nenacted our crisis management plan. Together, \nwe learned and shared how our operations \ncould best respond, particularly to the constant \nupdating of health and safety practices and \nprotocols. As long as the pandemic persists, we \nwill communicate with our people, providing \nthe latest evidence, the best personal protective \nequipment and support that is not just physical \nbut emotional and mental.\nRemarkably, we adjusted our work and \npersonal lives to forge on without any material \ninterruption to the products that our customers rely \non. Because of our role in the critical supply chain \nlinking fiber to packaging, bathroom tissue and \nhygiene products, the pulp business was deemed \nan essential service during the pandemic. We \ntake that responsibility with the utmost seriousness.\nWe owe an enormous debt of gratitude to our \nemployees: it\u2019s through their commitment and \ndedication that this response was possible. Our \ngoal is always to continue to stay safe together.\nEMPLOYEE \nENGAGEMENT\nIn 2020, we conducted our first global \nemployee engagement survey to better \nunderstand our workforce\u2019s perceptions. \nAdministered and analyzed by a third party, \nthe confidential employee responses were \naggregated and reviewed by our executive \nofficers and board of directors. As a result, \nin 202 1, our leaders worked with their teams \nto create action plans based on the areas \nof improvement identified. We believe we \ncan enhance our culture and improve our \noverall engagement by acting on results at \nboth an aggregate enterprise level and an \noperational level.\nMERCER INTERNATIONAL INC.
