SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021When Mark Goebel joined our Mercer \nCelgar mill in Castlegar, B.C., six years \nago, he brought a wealth of experience in \nsafety management. Early in his career, \nhe\u2019d spent 17 years as a first responder to \nhaunting workplace incidents at mines \nand mills throughout North America; \nlater, he spent a decade managing \nprevention programs in high-risk \nenvironments. But when he started at \nMercer Celgar as the Health and Safety \nManager, he saw something new.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that you could point to \nsomething specific and say, \u2018This one thing needs to change,\u2019\u201d says Mark, now \nVice-President, Health and Safety. \u201cWhen \nI arrived, something more was needed in \nthe culture, in the relationships. When it \ncame to safety, we needed to improve the \ntrust among our workforce.\u201d\nSenior executives recognized this \nneed, and in 2016 they launched our \nenterprise-wide Road to Zero campaign, \nintending to transform the health and \nsafety culture across the organization \u2014 \nincluding at Mercer Celgar.High Risks  \nForest product operations like ours have \ntypical big-industry health and safety \nrisks. Our employees handle chemicals, \nhigh-pressure steam, intense heat and \nmassive electrical energy. They work alone, \nat heights and in confined spaces. In short, \nthey work in complex environments, \nmaking Road to Zero our most crucial \ninitiative.\nWe had practical steps to accomplish, \nlike forming a governance team, setting \ntargets, reenergizing local health and \nsafety committees, providing training \nand developing refined standards. We \nalso needed to do the less tangible work \nof improving relationships to achieve our \nsafety goals. \u201cHonestly,\u201d says Mark, \u201cit \nwas a couple of challenging years as we \nimplemented the needed changes. The \nemployees and management agreed: we \nneeded to address our challenges and get \nafter this.\u201d\nSECTION 6: EMBRACE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYHigh Rewards  \nResults followed quickly. \u201cWe began to \nrecognize positive changes in attitudes \nand behaviors. And great things started \nto happen.\u201d\nIn 2019, Mercer Celgar was named the \nsecond-safest mill in North America; a \nyear later, it was honored for excellence \nby Canada\u2019s Safest Employer Awards \nin three categories, including Safest \nManufacturing Employer. The Road \nto Zero has prompted a focus on \nintentionally advancing our safety \nculture, the prevention programs that \ndrive that culture, with the intention to \nfurther reduce our incident rates.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still work to do. For us, it is about \ncontinuously improving relationships \nand communication and focusing on our \nhealth and safety commitments,\u201d Mark \nconcludes. \u201cBut I think we can be proud \nas an organization of how everyone \u2014 \nnot just senior leaders \u2014 put their hands \nup and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to change this.\u2019 \nAnd then actually put in the hard work.\u201dTo be recognized for a second year in a row for a topic \nthat I feel very passionately about is humbling. I thank \nall of our Mercer team members who have adopted \nhealth and safety as a core value and for incorporating \nthese values into their day-to-day safety actions.  \n\u2014  David Gandossi, Mercer CEO, on winning CEO of the Year  \n at the 2021 Canada\u2019s Safest Employer AwardsKPIs:   \nRoad To Zero  \nSafety Culture\nSIGNIFICANCE:  \nHealth and safety directly impacts our employee engagement and business \nsuccess. Safety performance is strongly related to the quality of our leadership \nand workplace culture. In addition, contractor safety is critical to successful \ncapital project deployment and execution of annual maintenance shutdowns.\nPROGRESS AND TARGETS:  \nOur overarching goal is zero accidents. In 202 1, we experienced  \n80 recordable injuries, which translates to a rate of incidents for all team \nmembers of 3.83 per 200,000 hours worked; this metric is generally referred \nto as the Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR). This record is not world-class, \nnor is it zero, and we will continue in our relentless pursuit of an injury-free \nworkplace for both employees and contractors.\nTHE MERCER WAY:  \nOur Road to Zero is embedded in our Mercer culture and work systems. \nWe proactively implement our nine Life-Saving Golden Rules to address \nhigh-risk activities and create a safety culture where people act safely in \neverything they do. We are committed to a zero-incident workplace and \nto the health and wellness of our people. We support this through training \nand policies on vital safety-related subjects, including risk assessments, \nsafety compliance, emergency response and preparedness, and industrial \nhygiene. Robust investigations are conducted after each incident to \nunderstand the root cause, communicate the findings and identify ways to \nprevent future occurrences. We conduct external safety audits to evaluate \nthe effectiveness of our safety programs.Road  \nto Zero\n550.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0TRIR (recordable incident rate) \n2017 2018 2019 2020 20213.83", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MERC_2021.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
