SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021The world is transitioning from \ndependence on fossil-fuel-based \nproducts towards adopting the \nnumerous possibilities offered by bio-\nbased products and sustainable wood \nresources. We are well-positioned to \nleverage our experience and expertise \nin the full utilization and continuous \nexpansion of our bioextractives and \nbiomaterials product mix.\nWe are actively researching, developing \nand investing in innovative products, \nincluding derivatives from our kraft \npulping process, as well as stand-alone \nextractive facilities.\nOur world is changing. The transition \naway from fossil fuels to more renewable \nmaterials is essential to mitigate the \nimpact of climate change.WOOD AND CLIMATE \nPROTECTION\nIt is not only the use of wood products \nthat contributes to climate protection. \nBy producing the required energy \nto operate our sawmill and our pulp \nmills from renewable raw materials, \nusing every fiber of the procured \nwood, we contribute to maintaining \nsustainability for future generations.ENERGY\nLast year, approximately 86 percent \nof our energy came from renewable \nbiomass obtained from forest waste.  \nWe operate four large biorefineries:  \ntwo in Germany at our Mercer \nRosenthal and Mercer Stendal \noperations, and two in Canada at \nMercer Celgar and Mercer Peace \nRiver. In addition, the Friesau sawmill in \nGermany also produces and exports \nrenewable energy. This allows us to be \n100 percent electricity self-sufficient \nand net exporters of green power.BIOCHEMICALS AND \nBIOMATERIALS\nThe kraft mill process produces \nmultiple renewable, bio-based \nextractives, including crude sulfate \nturpentine, methanol and crude tall oil. \nWe believe biomass green chemicals \nmay represent a key element of \ndeveloping new solutions in the \nfight to create a vibrant, healthy and \nsustainable 2 1st-century economy.Sustainable \nSolutions  \nfor Society\nSECTION 2: WHO WE AREPULP\nWe believe demand is rising for \nnatural, fiber-based products, \nespecially tissue, towels and hygiene \nand specialty paper products. Key \nelements driving such demand are \nimproving global living standards, \ncircular economy solutions, growing \npopulations and mounting interest in \nhealth and cleanliness.LUMBER AND  \nMASS TIMBER\nWood from sustainably managed \nforests provides a renewable and \nclimate-friendly material for building \nour world.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MERC_2021.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
