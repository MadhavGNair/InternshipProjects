SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021\nThere has been a pulp mill in Rosenthal \nam Rennsteig, set among the rolling, \npicturesque hills of East-central Germany, \nsince the late 1800s. Operate that long, \nin a mill as big and complex as our Mercer \nRosenthal facility, and you get to know \nthe locals.\nSo it\u2019s no wonder that as much as he \nfocuses on Mercer Rosenthal\u2019s bleached \nkraft pulp production, Leonhard Nossol \nhas happily devoted much of his workday \nfor nearly two decades to engaging with \nthe neighboring community. \u201cWithout \nthe support of this community, our \nmill would not have our social license \nto operate,\u201d says Leonhard, Mercer \nRosenthal\u2019s Managing Director. \u201cYou \nneed to look at the community and ask: \nWhat concerns them? What might they \nlose sleep over? And that directs what \nyou do, in ways big and small.\u201dEngagement of \nLocal CommunitiesGood Neighbors\nA major step, he says, will come when \nMercer Rosenthal replaces the giant \nmetal shed that houses logs bound for \nthe chipper. When massive logs meet \nthat metal cladding, sharp sounds \nreverberate through the countryside. It\u2019s \nessentially an enormous steel drum.\nThe fix is expensive, and the monetary \nreturn on this capital investment is, \nto put it graciously, immaterial. But, \nas Leonhard says, it is the neighborly \nthing to do. \u201cIt sounds so simple, but \nat Mercer Rosenthal, we decided some \nyears ago that a priority was to reduce \ndust, noise and smell. If you can do those \nthree things well, with honesty and open \ncommunication, you have an opportunity \nfor a good relationship.\u201d\nDust mitigation comes from a wetting \nsystem for the enormous piles of wood \nchips upward of 25 meters tall that \nbloom around the mill. Reducing the \nsmell means continuously improving \nhow we abate odorous gases before they \nescape into the country air. \u201cWe work \nto address the feedback we get from our \nneighbors. It makes us a better mill.\u201d\nThe community expresses respect and \npolite curiosity. Rosenthal\u2019s biannual \nopen house has attracted up to 7,000 \nvisitors, and we believe we are seen \nas a top employer in the region with a demonstrated commitment to lifelong \nlearning. Though our philanthropy is \nquiet and not widely recognized, the \nregion\u2019s leaders know what we contribute.\n\u201cI am most familiar with what we do \nat Mercer Rosenthal, of course,\u201d says \nLeonhard. \u201cBut I know that what our \noperations all have in common is the \ndesire to engage with our neighbors to \ntry to better the places we call home.\u201d\nCommunities in Times of Crisis\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 \noutbreak in 2020, we have continued \nour commitment to responding to the \ncommunity needs of our people \u2014 to \nprovide support to schools, medical and \nrelief agencies, and people impacted by \nthis challenging situation. While the \npandemic\u2019s devastating effects continued, \nother challenges emerged. For example, \nin British Columbia over 8,700 square \nkilometers of fires during the 2021 \nwildfire season resulted in a declared \nprovincial state of emergency.\nFloods in July throughout the regions \nof Nordrhein-Westfalen and Rheinland-\nPfalz in Western Germany caused great \nconcern among Mercer Stendal and \nMercer Holz employees. A fundraising \ncampaign was launched with empathy \nand solidarity between the two \ncompanies. In just one month, \u20ac10,000 \nwas collected.Mercer Timber Products and Mercer \nHolz, in cooperation with the joint \nventure wood2M GmbH, also \ncontributed to the flood relief by \npurchasing 14 professional construction \ndryers worth \u20ac15,000. These were made \navailable to affected residents, with the \nsupport of various companies, and used \nto dry the interiors of flooded houses.\nSuch efforts add to ongoing outreach \nprograms. In Castlegar, for instance, \nMercer Celgar\u2019s community outreach \noften focuses on the city\u2019s road safety and \npedestrian visibility in winter. At Mercer \nPeace River, we developed a region-wide \nreading program for children in Northern \nAlberta, understanding that reading is \nthe foundation for all learning.\nCommittees and Associations  \nOur German and Canadian operations \nhold memberships and foster \nrelationships with a wide variety \nof associations advocating for the \nsustainable management of pulp and \npaper, raw wood, timber and sawmills, \nforest products, energy and trades. You\u2019ll \nfind a list of these associations on pages \n86 and 87.\nSECTION 8: ENHANCE STAKEHOLDER AND INDIGENOUS ENGAGEMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MERC_2021.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
