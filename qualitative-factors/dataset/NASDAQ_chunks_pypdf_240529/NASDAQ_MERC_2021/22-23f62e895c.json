{"page_content": "43 42 MERCER INTERNATIONAL INC. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021Before it\u2019s even asked, Carsten Merforth \nanticipates the question with the \npatience of a man who\u2019s heard it a \nhundred times before: How does a \ncommitment to sustainability work in an \nindustry built on altering nature?\n\u201cSince I was a boy, I have always wanted \nto work in nature, to work in the forest,\u201d \nsays the Managing Director of Mercer \nTimber Products (MTP) and the head \nof our sawmill in Friesau, which sits in \nEastern Germany near the border with \nthe Czech Republic. \u201cAnd so I understand \nthis question. I know to some it might \nbe a contradiction to believe this and \nthen to cut down those very trees in \nthe forest.\u201d But to Carsten (who holds a \ndoctorate in forestry economics), it isn\u2019t a \ncontradiction.\nIn the 550 million board-feet (880,000 \ncubic meters) of annual lumber capacity \nat MTP , he sees a renewable material \ngrown by the sun, nurtured by the rain, Investing in  \nFiber Efficiency\nSECTION 5: CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE RESOURCE EFFICIENCYthat reduces the carbon footprint of new \nhomes by as much as a third compared \nto steel or concrete. He also sees MTP\u2019s \nsteam turbines, fueled by energy-rich \nbiomass from recovered bark, generating \nenough energy to run the sawmill while \nreturning electricity to the local grid. \nHe sees both a facility and a dedicated \nworkforce with plans to cut carbon \nemissions further.\n\u201cThis fiber that comes to Mercer Timber \nProducts \u2014 it\u2019s our responsibility to get \nthe most from it using the least amount \nof energy possible. That factors into all of \nour investment decisions.\u201d\nEnhancing Capabilities\nWe believe investments have transformed \nMTP into one of Europe\u2019s most modern \nsawmills. The mill holds one of the fastest \nplaning machines globally, including \nsorters, scanners and continuous kilns. \nSuch technological advancements further \nour sustainability efforts, ensuring \nlumber production for the European, North American and Asian markets that \nimproves the efficient use of energy and \nnatural resource inputs.\nWith the same goal in mind of \nsupporting sustainability through \nmodernization, our Canadian pulp \nmills are investing $84 million CAD to \nenhance their chipping capabilities with \nupgraded woodrooms, enabling other \nforest operators to burn less wood \nwaste on harvesting sites.In the 550 million board-feet of lumber cut and \nshipped annually at MTP, he sees a renewable \nmaterial grown by the sun, nurtured by the rain, \nthat reduces the carbon footprint of new homes by \nas much as a third compared to steel or concrete. \nFULL FOREST UTILIZATION  \nAND CONSUMPTION\nWorking to decarbonize our operations is not \nenough. We have also prioritized improving \nour use of forest fiber to maximize its benefits. \nAs a result, we see improvement in all our mills \nacross the organization.\nIn 202 1, Mercer Peace River has achieved \n1 20 percent of Alberta\u2019s provincial wood \nutilization standards by chipping the whole \ntree and increasing merchantable and \npreviously unmerchantable volumes through \nrecovery, thereby improving pulp yield. What \nis left behind is redistributed to the cutblock, \nmaintaining productive habitat. We believe  \nthis 1 20 percent achievement will continue  \nafter the 2022 transition from portable \nchipping to a central chipping facility.\nOur Mercer Holz procurement team buys \na range of quality wood from sustainably \nmanaged private, communal and state forests \nfor our German mills. A $70 million USD \nupgrade to our Mercer Timber Products sawmill \nhas increased the usability of each log. At \nMercer Celgar, we\u2019ve worked with the industry \nand government to facilitate the collection of \nwaste wood to convert to valuable wood chips \nfor use in our pulp operations. In addition, \nnew chip-screening equipment optimizes the \nwood chips we \u201ccook\u201d into pulp in all our pulp \nmills, reducing maintenance and increasing \nefficiency.\nThese small but significant improvements allow \nus to maximize the use of renewable resources.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MERC_2021.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
