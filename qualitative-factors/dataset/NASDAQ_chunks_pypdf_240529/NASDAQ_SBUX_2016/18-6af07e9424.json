{"page_content": "19\nFROM OUR PARTNERS\nGiving Back  \nThrough Service\nStarbucks partners have a long history of giving back to their \ncommunities through community service. For more than nine years, partners in Beijing have supported Cinema for the Blind, a charitable project aimed at helping the blind better enjoy both local and foreign films, by having volunteers narrate the onscreen details. \nAs a Starbucks partner who lives and breathes the Starbucks \nmission and values, Zheng Tao, an 11-year partner, is not only an accomplished Coffee Master in the Starbucks North China region, he also has always felt compelled to extend a helping hand to  the underprivileged around him. He has been volunteering with the project for six years to effectively narrate and share more than  \n40 movies and contributing more than 9,000 hours.\n \u201cWhen my supervisor told me about Starbucks involvement \nsupporting the Cinema for the Blind project in Beijing, I jumped immediately at the opportunity,\u201d recalled Tao. \u201cIt was amazing to be able to be the eyes for the blind, and to help them enjoy a movie as I do.\u201d\nIn September 2016, Zheng Tao was honored, among some \nof China\u2019s most influential business leaders, entrepreneurs and technologists, as one of China\u2019s top 50 innovators for his contributions and commitment to Cinema for the Blind in Beijing. This annual award, organized by China\u2019s leading business publication, CBN Weekly , is today one of the most important \nranking for Chinese leaders in business, brand, technology and design, and  aims to recognize, encourage and celebrate their innovation-led pursuits and aspirations.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SBUX_2016.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
