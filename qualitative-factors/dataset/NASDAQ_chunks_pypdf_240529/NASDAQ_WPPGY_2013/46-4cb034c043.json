We also measure carbon intensity against revenue, which also shows a decrease on last year.\nOur absolute carbon footprint in 2013 was 279,859 tonnes of CO\n2e (rating \nrenewable electricity as zero emissions), a decrease of 1% over 2012 despite a\u00a03% growth in headcount. If the renewable electricity we purchase globally \nis\u00a0rated using the same emissions factors as standard grid electricity, our total \ncarbon footprint in 2013 was 301,158 tonnes of CO\n2e.\nNote to chart:  Since 2006, our \nabsolute\u00a0carbon footprint has \nincreased by 4%, compared to a growth in reported headcount of 50%\u00a0and revenue growth of 87%.2.35\ntonnes of CO2e emitted  \nper person in 2013  \n(2012: 2.45)\n279,859\ntonnes of CO2e emitted in 2013  \n(2012: 283,321)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WPPGY_2013.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
