{"page_content": "51 WPP S USTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014\nEnvironmentNotes to WPP\u2019s carbon emissions statement 2013\n1. R eporting standard\nOur carbon emissions statement 2013 has been prepared \nin\u00a0accordance with the World Resource Institute (WRI) and\u00a0World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition (the\u00a0GHG Protocol). \n2. G reenhouse gases\nAll greenhouse gases emissions figures are in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\n2e). They include three of \nthe six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol \u2013 carbon dioxide (CO\n2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide \n(N2O). Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions have been omitted from our reporting as they are not a material source of greenhouse gases for WPP.\n3. O rganisational boundary\nEmissions data is included for all operations for which WPP and its subsidiaries have operational control. This covers 119,116 employees. Associate companies are excluded. \n4. O perational boundary\nWe include the following emissions in our reporting:\n \u2022Direct emissions (scope 1): \u2022\tFuel used to heat WPP premises (combustion of\u00a0natural gas and heating oil).\n \u2022Indirect emissions (scope 2):\u2022\tAll purchased electricity, including electricity purchased at grid average carbon intensity and renewable electricity purchased under specific green-tariff contracts.\n \u2022Other indirect emissions (scope 3):\u2022\tEmployee business air travel.\n\u2022\tAn estimate for other scope 3 emissions that we\u00a0do\u00a0not currently measure, including emissions from leased cars, taxis and couriers. This estimate is\u00a0an additional 15% that we add to our carbon footprint and is shown under \u2018other estimated scope\u00a03\u00a0emissions\u2019.\n5. G eographic scope\nOur CO2e emissions data covers our worldwide operations.6. E mission factors\nCO2e emissions have been calculated on the basis of \nmeasured or estimated energy use, fuel use and miles travelled, multiplied by the relevant carbon emission factors. In 2013, we updated our emission factors for scope\u00a01,\u00a0scope 2 and scope 3 emissions, and our data is\u00a0based on the following emissions factors: \nEmission scope Emission factors used\nScope 1 \n(fuel used to heat WPP premises)IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (using global warming potentials from the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report).\nScope 2 (purchased electricity)International Energy Agency, CO\n2 Emissions from \nFuel Combustion, 2013 edition.\nScope 3 (business air \ntravel)UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural \nAffairs (Defra), Conversion Factors for Company \nReporting (2013).\nWhen calculating our carbon footprint, we rate \npurchased\u00a0renewable electricity as zero emissions. For\u00a0full\u00a0transparency, we also disclose total electricity purchased at\u00a0grid average carbon intensity.\n7. D ata collection methodology\nData used to calculate CO2e emissions is collected quarterly \nthrough WPP\u2019s financial reporting system, and includes some estimated data (e.g. in some locations electricity usage is estimated based on headcount or floor space). In\u00a02013, our data covered 99% of our operations by employee headcount. The remaining 1% was extrapolated based on the Group\u2019s total headcount at year-end.\n8. E xternal assurance\nOur carbon data is reviewed by Bureau Veritas, an independent assurance provider. Following its review  \nof our 2012 data, Bureau Veritas made a number of recommendations for improving our approach. We have implemented many of these in our 2013 reporting process. This includes updating our reporting guidelines and issuing a reporting tool to help our companies use data during the year to manage performance. The assurance statement is available on pages 75 and 76.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WPPGY_2013.pdf", "page": 52, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
