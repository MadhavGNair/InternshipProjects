{"page_content": "15Growing our use of clean energy\nSince announcing our Energy 2030 framework in November \n2015, we have developed projects that we expect will increase \nour owned renewable capacity by roughly nine times by the \nend of 2024. Growing our use of renewable resources is a  \npart of our strategy for achieving net-zero carbon electricity \nby 2050.\nResource planning and carbon regulation\nWhen making generation decisions, MGE engages in \nextensive resource planning analysis and modeling, which \nconsider many factors including forecasted energy use \nprojections; long-term impacts on customers, investors and \nthe environment; potential future environmental regulations; \nassumptions related to the anticipated costs of fuel and \nmany other factors related to energy production. Our \neconomic analysis explicitly includes possible projected carbon \nemissions limits to help ensure our decisions are financially \nsound\u2014regardless of whether or how carbon is regulated  \nin the future.\nIn addition, large new generating facilities are reviewed \nby the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to ensure \nthe projects are in the public interest. For larger projects, \ndifferent generating scenarios are modeled in our regulatory \napplication to demonstrate the need and to justify the cost. \nAll proposals and decisions by the state regulatory body are \npart of the public record.\nOngoing transition from fossil fuels\nMGE has no controlling interest in coal-fired resources and \nannounced several years ago that we would not be investing \nfurther in coal-fired plants. In 2011, MGE discontinued the use \nof coal at the only generating facility in which we have sole \nownership, our Blount Generating Station.\nAdditionally, as part of a rate case settlement agreement  \nin 2018, MGE accelerated the depreciation of certain assets, \nincluding our combustion turbines, Blount Generating Station \nand Columbia Energy Center Unit 1. The accelerated \ndepreciation schedule and retirement of coal-fired \ngeneration will help the company move forward with \ninvestments in cleaner sources of energy. In 2021, MGE,  \nas a minority owner, and the co-owners of the Columbia \nEnergy Center announced the planned retirement of the  \nplant by 2025. Energy 2030 set our foundational objectives for building your community energy company for the future. Introduced in \nNovember 2015, our Energy 2030 framework continues to guide our strategy and our work to provide customers with \noptions they want today and in the future.
