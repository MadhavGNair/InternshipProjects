Our carbon reduction goals reflect our vision and \nsignal our direction but do not determine our pace. \nOur carbon emissions reductions \nIn May 2019, MGE announced a goal of net-zero carbon \nelectricity by 2050, which aligns with the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its assessment of \nlimiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. \nConsistent with climate science, we expect to achieve carbon \nreductions of at least 65% by 2030. \nSince 2005, MGE has reduced its carbon emissions 30%. We\u2019ve \nsaid since introducing our clean energy and carbon reduction \ngoals\u2014if we can go further faster through partnerships with \nour customers and the evolution of new technologies, we will.\nFor emissions reporting, see page 16 and our Edison  \nElectric Institute (EEI) quantitative template at  \nmgeenergy.com/environment.Our clean energy transition\nSince 2015, the company has grown its asset base from  \n$1.7 billion to $2.3 billion, with an estimated $565 million \nin recent and projected clean energy and battery storage \ninvestments through 2024 helping to fuel the company\u2019s \nongoing clean energy transition.\nOur work with customers\nOur Energy 2030 framework for a more sustainable future, \nintroduced in November 2015, guides our work to ensure all \ncustomers benefit from our ongoing clean energy transition. \nMGE is advancing a cleaner energy future cost-effectively \nwhile working to maintain our top-ranked electric reliability. \nObjectives in our Energy 2030 framework include:\n \u00bbTransitioning to a more sustainable energy supply\n \u00bbGiving customers more control around energy\n \u00bbReducing costs by managing our collective use of energy\n \u00bbBuilding a dynamic, integrated grid to enable new \ntechnology \n \u00bbEnsuring that all customers benefit from changing \ntechnology\n \u00bbDeepening our engagement with the communityOur partnership with the Nelson Institute  \nfor Environmental Studies\nIn 2019, MGE began working with Dr. Tracey Holloway from \nthe University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s Nelson Institute for \nEnvironmental Studies to evaluate the company\u2019s goal of net-\nzero carbon electricity by 2050. Her analysis was done within \nthe context of the October 2018 special report on global \nwarming of 1.5 degrees Celsius by the IPCC. Dr. Holloway used \nmodels to analyze MGE\u2019s goal. The models suggested that by \n2050, emissions from electricity generation in industrialized \ncountries should be 87% to 99% lower than the 2005 \nbaseline. MGE\u2019s plan for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 \nis a 100% reduction from 2005 levels and reflects carbon \nreductions consistent with limiting global warming  \nto 1.5 degrees Celsius. \nWe continue to partner with the Nelson Institute to further \ninform how best to employ our key strategies within our \ncommunity and with our customers to achieve carbon \nreductions. The UW-Madison report is available at  \nmge.com/netzeroreport.\nOur commitment to reliability\nWe\u2019re investing in long-term sustainability to benefit all \nstakeholders while maintaining top-ranked energy reliability. \nSafe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy powers our \ncommunities and critical services, our households and our  \nlocal economy. \nAccording to an annual industry survey including more than \n75 electric utilities nationwide, in 2020, MGE experienced a \nrecord-breaking year for electric reliability, recording its best \nperformance ever in the two main industry reliability metrics. \nMGE saw both the fewest number of outages and the shortest \nduration of outages per customer in 2020. \nSystem Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), which \nmeasures the frequency of customer outages, was 0.24 in \n2020, meaning, on average, MGE customers experience one \npower outage every four years.System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) measures \nthe total time an average customer experiences a non-\nmomentary power interruption in a one-year period. For \nadditional reporting of these metrics, see page 26.\nOur Board of Directors \nStrong oversight by our community-focused Board of \nDirectors, our board\u2019s engagement with management and \nour participation in third-party benchmarking and evaluation \nprograms help us assess our performance and promote \ncontinuous improvement. We take a proactive approach \nto environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters; \ncorporate responsibility and companywide sustainability;  \nrisk assessment and mitigation; and long-term strategy.  \nBoard oversight includes assessment of current and/or  \nfuture environmental regulations. It also includes review  \nof the company\u2019s environmental and sustainability \nperformance and of this report every year. See the  \nGovernance and Oversight section of this report for \ninformation about our corporate practices.\nOur commitment to transparency and disclosure\nWe have reviewed the recommendations of the Task Force  \non Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), performed \nan analysis of our disclosures relative to the TCFD \nrecommendations and determined that our companywide \ndisclosures are consistent with and responsive to the TCFD \nguidance and recommendations. We also continually monitor \nand review the reports of and/or engage with a number of \nthird-party ESG analytics and ratings firms to help inform \nour reporting to make available and accessible information \nrelevant to our company operations and our industry.  \nWe are committed to helping customers, investors and  \nother stakeholders better understand our strategies,  \nrisks, challenges and opportunities as we transition to  \na more sustainable, net-zero carbon future.
