{"page_content": "17Reducing emissions\nWe have made strides to reduce emissions by installing \nemission reduction equipment and improving equipment \nefficiencies with our current generation fleet. As we work \ntoward our ambitious goal of net-zero carbon electricity by \n2050, we continue to make significant investments in local \nand regional, cost-effective renewable generation. Ensuring \nthat new and changing technology serves all customers \nequitably is one of our key objectives under our Energy \n2030 framework. We are working to build a smarter, cleaner \ncommunity grid that serves to benefit all customers.\nHarnessing renewable natural gas\nMGE continues to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts with \nan initiative that generates electricity from the combustion \nof methane, which is produced locally by cow manure. As a \nGHG, methane is at least 25 times more potent than carbon; \nhowever, methane as a fuel burns much cleaner and produces \n50% less GHGs than coal.\nMGE receives energy from a manure digester. The digester \nconverts cow manure from local farms into electricity. For 2020, the manure digester generated more than 9.3 million \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, which is enough to power \nmore than 1,500 households.\nUnder an Environmental Protection Agency requirement, \nMGE monitors, measures and reports several GHG emissions \nannually. MGE tracking covers power plant emissions, natural \ngas distribution and smaller combustion sources.\nEdison Electric Institute ESG/sustainability \nreporting templates\nTo advance further transparency and disclosure in company \noperations and governance, MGE participates in the Edison \nElectric Institute\u2019s (EEI) environmental, social and governance \n(ESG)/sustainability-related reporting templates. The \nquantitative template includes data related to MGE\u2019s energy \nportfolio (generation and capacity), emissions, capital \nexpenditures, and human and natural resources. The \nqualitative template includes information related to our \ncompany\u2019s management and oversight of and strategies \nfor transitioning toward deep decarbonization and greater \nsustainability. These templates are voluntary and industry-\nspecific.
