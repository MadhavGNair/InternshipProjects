Serving as our \u201cpeople operating system\u201d approach, it ensures transparency and clarity \nfor individuals seeking to understand how their roles align with the organization and how they can grow their \ncareers at Ansys. In 2020, we also launched an initiative called \u201csuccess profile\u201d which is a leadership competency \nmodel designed to further our strong foundation for leadership development at Ansys. The model focuses on \nthought leadership, results leadership, people leadership and self-leadership. \nIn addition to targeted outreach to minority groups or institutions, we attend career and networking events aimed toward recruiting \ndiverse candidates. In 2020, we expanded these efforts, attending events that allowed us to interface with nearly 10,000 diverse \njobseekers. Further, we intend to attract early career talent through the Ansys internship/co-op programs for current students and we \nvalue partnerships, through universities and societies, that promote these programs to diverse audiences.6%\nTotal Annual \nEmployee Turnover \nRate(As of 12/31/2020)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANSS_2020.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
