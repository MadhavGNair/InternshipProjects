While \nmany universities had strong virtual teaching infrastructure in \nplace, many did not.Ansys supported those universities \nstruggling to transition their students \nto remote access with temporary \nlicense keys to make it easier for their \nprofessors and students to access our \nsoftware.\nSimulation  \nfor student \neducationIn July of 2020, we launched Ansys Innovation Courses (ansys.\ncom/courses) that hosts more than 50 free courses with new \ncourses added monthly. These courses are self-paced and use \nsimulation to both visualize and reinforce concepts. Many of \nthe courses are application based with an array of foundational \nphysics courses to complement these. Our aim is to be a \nthought leader on how simulation can be introduced earlier \non in the engineering curriculum in an on-demand way while \nmaking self-learning available to students and early-career \nprofessionals.Since launch, more than 36,000 \nunique users spanning 112 countries \n(as of 12/31/2020) have utilized Ansys \nInnovation Courses with more than 70% \nengaging in a repeat session.\nStudent  \ncommunityIn August of 2020, we migrated our previous Ansys Student \nCommunity to a new platform and re-branded as the Ansys \nLearning Forum (https://forum.ansys.com/ ).
