The \nAnsys business continuity and incident response process is designed to provide an immediate response to any unplanned business \ninterruption and to facilitate the subsequent recovery. \n \nA centralized group oversees response and recovery activities and supports the recovery of impacted teams. Ansys has corporate \npolicies and procedures for disaster recovery and information security. Policies support each area and services exist to assess, \nmitigate and remediate any negative impacts of such an interruption. In addition, Ansys has emergency response plans that focus on \nsafeguarding staff and recovering facilities following a site-level disruption. \n \nBusiness Continuity \nBusiness continuity focuses on the recovery or continuity of critical business processes within Ansys business units. Disaster recovery \nplans outline measures for the restoration of critical systems and data in the event of a crisis or disaster, including the loss of a data \ncenter.
