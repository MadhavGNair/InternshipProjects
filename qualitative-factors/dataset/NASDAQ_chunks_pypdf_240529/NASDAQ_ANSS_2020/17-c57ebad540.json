Over the past year we have strengthened our approach by \nmeasuring our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and establishing an energy baseline. Our 2019 GHG baseline is primarily composed of our office locations and data centers and was calculated in accordance with GHG Protocol Corporate Standard set by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Resources Institute (WRI).  \nOur San Jose, Livermore, and San Diego, California offices are enrolled in clean energy electricity, which is a community choice energy \nprogram that provides customers with cleaner energy sources with a greater percentage of renewable energy and carbon free electricity. In addition, our Livermore, United States and Pune, India offices have on-site solar roof panels, which lower our overall non-renewable energy consumption.\nIn 2020, we disclosed our first assessment of our climate change impact through CDP, a global non-profit that runs the world\u2019s leading \nenvironmental disclosure platform.\n*Ansys updated its calculation methodology in 2020 for our leased sites where we do not have actual utility data. Thus, we have restated 2019 data using the updated methodology, for comparability.GHG INVENTORY*\nPerformance Data 2019 CO 2e (Metric Tons) 2020 CO 2e (Metric Tons)\nScope 1 2,159 2,485\nScope 2\n(Location and Market Based)14,117  (Location Based) \n14,475  (Market Based)13,135 (Location Based)\n13,560 (Market Based)\nTotal 16,276 15,620\nIntensity\n(per square feet)0.012416\nENERGY CONSUMPTION and LEED Certification\nRenewable Energy (1)152 MWh 119 MWh\nBuildings with LEED / BREEM Certification (2) 7 8\n(% of t\notal active square footage) 22%+ 23%+\nTotal Energy Consumed 42,545 MWh 43,684 MWh\nPercentage of Grid Electricity76.18%0.011655\n73.62%\n(1) On-site Pune Solar Generation.
