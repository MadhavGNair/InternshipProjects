{"page_content": "OUR WASTE \nSTEWARDSHIP FIGURES FOR 2019/2020/2021 \nIncreasing digital engagement led by our \nmarketing and sales team \nIn 2021 our Zhermack GmbH Germany marketing \nand sales team, based in Marl a. Duemmer, committed to saving paper through digitalization. The team at Zhermack GmbH Germany is responsible for selling high-quality medical products for clinical dental practice supplies, orthodontics and dental laboratories, and historically the marketing, communications and sales team heavily relied on printed catalogues, flyers and product information to reach their many customers. \nTo increase the sustainable credentials of the \nsite, last year site leadership team implemented a 20/80 rule \u2013 meaning that 80% of all marketing materials had to become digitalized. The program has been welcomed by employees and customers alike, and the team is on track to become almost paperless within the next year.

We also reground the polyamide PA66 up to four times on site so it can be re-used throughout our production line. When the polyamide PA66 no longer meets our standards framework for use, the material is used as a raw material by other companies to produce other goods. \nThe recycling program is one of many \nsustainability initiatives at our Ballaigues site, which owns the MINERGIE\u00ae label for low-energy-consumption buildings and the highest possible use of renewable energy. Between 2018 and 2020, the site also successfully completed a three-year carbon emissions reduction plan that resulted in a reduction of 326 tonnes of CO\n2 and a 13% increase in energy \nefficiency.
