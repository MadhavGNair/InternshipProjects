{"page_content": "In 2021, our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity (metric \ntonnes CO2/US$M Net Sales)  decreased by 17% from the 2019 \nba\nseline measurement, representing an absolute decrease of 5,463 \nmetric tonnes of greenhouse gas emitted. However, emissions on an absolute basis increased in 2021 because we added three new sites to our data set. In additional overall site emissions also decreased in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting operations across all our sites. Therefore, we are using the 2019 baseline as a more meaningful comparative for business-as-usual operations.
