{"page_content": "Solar energy use rising at Wellspect\u2019s Kazan facility \nOur Wellspect manufacturing site in Kazan, Turkey, installed 1,155 \nsolar panels in October 2021, leading to the generation of 300,23 MW of power.\n11 The total yearly saving capacity is estimated to \nreach 500MVh which equates to a reduction of 150 tonnes of CO\n2 emissions annually. Daily generation changes with weather \nconditions, but on average the panels supply approximately 15% of the electricity needed to operate the site.\nAnd the team is not stopping there. They are working with \nengineers to determine if they can install solar panels on the face of the building\u2019s south side. They have also begun a project to replace existing service vehicles with electric ones, which includes constructing parking shades with solar panels on the roofs that would power the vehicles\u2019 charging stations.Kazan  \nTurkey\nReducing CO2 emissions and electricity savings\nBensheim is the largest production site owned by Dentsply Sirona and as a result we have implemented several environmental targets and programs designed to improve the environmental impact of the site. Last year we installed technology that measures and detects leakage from our compressed air supply, and by the end of 2022 we hope to reduce our CO\n2 emissions by \n29 tonnes per year and make electricity savings of 90 MWh per year. We also installed hot water heat pump technology in the changing rooms of two buildings which will reduce CO\n2 emissions \nby 4 tonnes per year, and electricity saving by 12 MWh per year.
