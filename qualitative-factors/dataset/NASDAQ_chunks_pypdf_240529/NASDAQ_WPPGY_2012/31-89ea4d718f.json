Reporting standard\nOur carbon emissions statement 2012 has been prepared \nin\u00a0accordance with the World Resource Institute (WRI) \nand \u00a0World Business Council for Sustainable Development \n(WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A \u00a0Corporate \nAccounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition \n(the \u00a0GHG Protocol). \n2.  Greenhouse gases\nAll greenhouse gases emissions \ufb01gures are in tonnes \nof\u00a0carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). They include three \nof\u00a0the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol \n\u2013 carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide \n(N2O). Per\ufb02uorocarbons (PFCs), hydro\ufb02uorocarbons (HFCs) \nand sulphur hexa\ufb02uoride (SF6) emissions have been \nomitted \u00a0from our reporting as they are not a material \nsource \u00a0of greenhouse gases for \u00a0WPP.\n3.  Organisational boundary\nEmissions data is included for all operations for which WPP \nand its subsidiaries have operational control. This covers 115,711 employees. Associate companies are excluded. \n4.  Operational boundary\nWe include the following emissions in our reporting:\n  Direct emissions (scope 1): \nt\u0001Fuel used to heat WPP premises (combustion \nof\u00a0natural gas and heating oil).\n  Indirect emissions (scope 2):\nt\u0001All purchased electricity, including electricity \npurchased at grid average carbon intensity and renewable electricity purchased under speci\ufb01c green-tariff contracts.\n  Other indirect emissions (scope 3):\nt\u0001Employee business air travel.\nt\u0001An estimate for other scope 3 emissions that we \ndo \u00a0not \u00a0currently measure, including emissions from \nleased \u00a0cars, taxis and couriers; this estimate is an \nadditional 15% that we add to our carbon footprint and \u00a0is shown under \u2018Other estimated scope 3 emissions\u2019.\n5.  Geographic scope\nOur CO\n2e emissions data covers our worldwide operations.6.  Emission factors\nCO2e emissions have been calculated on the basis of \nmeasured or estimated electricity use, fuel use and miles \ntravelled, multiplied by the relevant carbon emission factors. In 2012, we updated our emission factors for scope 1\u00a0and scope 2 emissions, and our data is now based \non \u00a0the \u00a0following: \nEmission scope Emission factors used\nScope 1 \n(fuel used to heat WPP premises)IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (using global warming potentials from the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report)\nScope 2 (purchased electricity)International Energy Agency, CO\n2 Emissions \nfrom Fuel Combustion, 2012 edition\nScope 3 (business air travel)Defra Guidelines for Company Reporting on \u00a0Greenhouse Gas Emissions Annexes, \nJuly \u00a02005\n When calculating our carbon footprint, we rate purchased \nrenewable electricity as zero emissions. If the renewable electricity we purchase globally is rated using the same emissions factors as standard grid electricity, our total carbon footprint in 2012 was 307 ,102 tonnes of CO\n2e.\n7.  Data collection methodology \nData used to calculate CO2e emissions is collected quarterly \nthrough WPP\u2019s \ufb01nancial reporting system, and includes \nsome estimated data (e.g. in some locations electricity usage is estimated based on headcount or \ufb02oor space). In\u00a02012, our data covered 99% of our operations by employee \nheadcount. The remaining 1% was extrapolated based on the \u00a0Group\u2019s total headcount at year end.\n8.  External assurance \nWe commissioned Bureau Veritas to undertake independent \nexternal assurance of our data (see pages 102 and 103). Bureau Veritas made a number of recommendations for improving our approach, which we will implement in our 2013 reporting.Key numbers  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WPPGY_2012.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
