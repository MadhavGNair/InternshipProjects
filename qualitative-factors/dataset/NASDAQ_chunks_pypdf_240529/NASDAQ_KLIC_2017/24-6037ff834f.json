{"page_content": " \n \n23 \n Environment  \nEnergy Usage & Associated GHG Emissions  \n \nOperating in an energy intensive manufacturing industry, K& S seeks to be cost effective alongside \nminimizing  the impact of our operations on the environment. K&S has set a formal target of reducing  \nthe energy consumption normalized by net revenue  by 2%  from past CY\u2019s performance . From Figure \n21 and 22 , we see a 10 % increase in total  electricity consumption from 20,043 MWh in CY2016 to \n22,947 MWh in CY2017 and the corresponding increase in total carbon emissions. However, w hen \nnormalized by net revenue, we still continue to see a downward trend in  reduction of  elect ricity \nconsumption by 16 .1%, meeting our target for two consecutive years.   \nElectricity Consumption (MWh)  \n(Electricity consumption for all 6 K&S sites normalized by net revenue)  \nCY2015  CY2016  CY2017  \n37 31 26 \n \nFigure 22: Electricity Consumption  \n \n \n \n \n Focus Area  Target  for CY2018  CY2016  Performance  CY2017  Performance  \nEnergy Usage  Reduce electricity \nconsumption from past \nCY by 2%  16.2% \nreduction \nfrom \nCY2015         Achieved   16.1% \nreduction \nfrom \nCY2016        Achieved   \n20,943 22,947 \n05,00010,00015,00020,00025,000\nCY2016 CY2017Electricity Consumption (MWh)\n12,267 13,594 \n03,0006,0009,00012,00015,000\nCY2016 CY2017GHG Emissions (tonnes CO2) Figure 21: GHG Emissions  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2017.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
