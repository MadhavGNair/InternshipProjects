This was an increase from 251 smelters in CY2015 . \nWe are working towards progressively increasing the  number of conflict free smelter sources.  \nCoupled with driving 100% CMRT response rate from our 3TG Tier -1 suppliers, t his enables K&S to \nprogressively work towards the goal of achieving 100% CM -free products shipped from CY2022.  \n \nSince CY2013, K&S has filed our Conflict Minerals Report (\u201cCMR\u201d) to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) .
