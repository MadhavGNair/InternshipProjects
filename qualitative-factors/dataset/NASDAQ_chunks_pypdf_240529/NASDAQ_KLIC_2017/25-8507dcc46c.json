{"page_content": " \n \n24 \n Through the concerted efforts of all six sites, K&S has embarked on various energy -saving initiatives. \nSome of our initiatives at the Fort Washington and Singapore sites are highlighted in the case study \nbelow.  \nFort Washington  \nIn 2017, electricity saving initiatives were implemented at the Fort Washington site during the year. \nThe reduction in electricity consumption is attributed to initiatives such as the installation of mot ion \nsensors and the replacement of metal halide lamps to energy -saving LED lights in Dec ember  2017. \nIn the compressor systems, air pressure and regulator settings wer e optimized, and a leaking shut -\noff valve in the compressed air line was replaced. The ope ration of heating, ventilation and air -\nconditioning (\u201cHVAC\u201d) systems are one of the most energy -intensive components in buildings.   In \nSeptember 2017, 39 roof top HVAC units were retrofitted with upgraded economizers which \ncontributed to the reduction in e lectricity usage.  \n \nSingapore  \nIn Singapore, we have implemented a compressor monitoring system which allow for real time \nmonitoring of demand and supply of compressed air. The data gathered will enable the system to \nadjust compressor settings and utilization to an optimal level. Thus t his has resulted in cost and \nenergy savings.  \n \n \n \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2017.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
