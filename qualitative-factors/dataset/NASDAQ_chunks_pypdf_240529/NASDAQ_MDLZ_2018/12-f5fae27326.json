Cocoa is the \nessence of our chocolate \nand vital to our business, so \nwe ensure it is \u201cmade right.\u201d \nMaking it right means tackling the complex \nchallenges that cocoa farmers face. That \nis why we created Cocoa Life. Just as the \nCadbury brothers did more than 100 years \nago, we work on the ground, hand-in-hand \nwith the men and women who make their \nliving from cocoa. Through Cocoa Life, \nwe are creating a movement for lasting \nchange, rooted in deep understanding \nthrough sector-wide collaboration and \npartnership. We co-create solutions to \nmake cocoa farming a business of choice \nand to build communities that take on their \nown development while conserving the \nnatural resources.\nTogether, we grow opportunities. When \nour consumers choose chocolate with the \nCocoa Life logo, it means everyone can \nlove our chocolate as much as we do\u2014\nbecause it\u2019s made the right way.\n13", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2018.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
