We\u2019re focused on areas where we believe we \ncan have the greatest impact, using our scale to drive meaningful change for consumers. \nWe\u2019re empowering farmers who grow our key ingredients, like cocoa and wheat, and investing in their communities to help them thrive. We\u2019re producing our snacks \nwith less energy, water and waste; sourcing our ingredients more sustainably and in ways that reduce deforestation in our supply chain; and developing zero net \nwaste packaging. We\u2019re seeking more transparency and raising expectations of our suppliers to address cross-cutting themes, such as human and land rights. We\u2019re \nevolving our snacks and improving the nutrition profile of many of our beloved brands. We maintain world-class safety standards for the foods we sell and the \nfacilities in which our people work. And we continue to invest in community programs that help improve the well-being of children and their families, providing them \nwith access to nutritious foods, as well as help those affected by disaster around the globe.  \nWe have specific goals and targets to which we hold ourselves accountable, and report our progress publicly each year. Our commitments are aligned with our \nbusiness\u2019 impact ambition to make snacks in the right way and several of them directly support the above UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  \n6", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2018.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
