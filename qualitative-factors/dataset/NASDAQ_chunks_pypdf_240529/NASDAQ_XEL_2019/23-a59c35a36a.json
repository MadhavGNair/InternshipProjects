{"page_content": "24 \nTHE FUTURE IN SIGHT | XCEL ENERGY\nRENEWABLE \nENERGY \nXcel Energy operates in some of the country\u2019s best regions for producing wind and solar power, and we \nare putting these resources to work for customers.\nIncreasingly, the customers and communities we serve want their energy from clean, renewable sources, \nand we are delivering. Renewable energy plays a vital and growing role in our energy supply and future \nplans for meeting customer needs. We anticipate that as we reach our goal to reduce carbon emissions \n80% by 2030, renewable sources will generate up to 60% of the electricity we provide. \nWind and solar technologies continue to improve, and prices have declined, making it possible to operate a \nreliable, affordable power grid with significant levels of renewable generation. When it comes to managing \ncost and reliability, scale matters. We focus on increasing the use of large-scale, universal wind and \nsolar energy because these resources are significantly more economical and can provide energy for all \ncustomers at half the cost compared to smaller, distributed resources.\nWe also understand that some customers want more renewable energy, beyond what is currently in our \nenergy supply. This includes some of our business customers and communities that have set goals for \nup to 100% renewable energy. To meet this need, we are enabling customers to achieve their goals by \nimproving and expanding our voluntary renewable choices.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XEL_2019.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
