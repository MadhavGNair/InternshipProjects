By establishing strong \nrelationships with employers, nonprofit \norganizations, and donors, NECAT is able to provide its students with \ncomprehensive and industry-specific \njob readiness training, career-directed education, individualized support, employment services, and placement \nassistance targeted to the practical \nneeds of the workplace. \nEncore Boston Harbor supported a major \nfundraising event to benefit NECAT on \nGiving Tuesday in 2018. The event saw NECAT students cook and prepare \nan exquisite tasting menu alongside \nexecutive chefs from Encore Boston Harbor. Encore Boston Harbor employees volunteered 500 pro bono \nhours in planning and organizing the \nevent, worth $75,000 in value.
