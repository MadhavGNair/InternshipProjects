Our goal is simple\u2014we \nwant to prevent serious injuries or deaths, which can and do happen because of the inherent risks of electricity and natural gas. \nMost serious accidents happen because someone directly or indirectly contacts an overhead electric line, digs into an electric or \nnatural gas line, or fails to respond safely to the warning signs of a gas or electric emergency. Just as we want our employees to \nreturn home safely every day to their families, we seek the same for others\u2014including customers, communities, contractors and \nfirst responders. \nCommunity Support\nWe serve the energy needs of hundreds of cities and towns throughout our service territory, and we are integral members of \nthose communities. After all, we are literally connected to the communities we serve through active and ongoing investment in \ntheir infrastructures.\nWe believe we have a responsibility to have a positive impact in all we do\u2014as a good neighbor, community advocate and  \nenvironmental steward. Our community impact is far reaching\u2014from community investment funding to employee volunteering  \nto environmental partnerships and educational initiatives.Find information about customer safety programs  \non our website.Check online for more information\nXcel Energy Community Investment\nRating Organization 2011 2010 2009 \nFocus Area Grants $3,928,270 $4,057,065 $3,701,700\n Economic sustainability $1,165,180 $1,131,700 $1,081,200\n Environment $886,620 $973,215 $764,500\n Arts and culture $670,900 $734,350 $788,200\n Education $1,205,570 $1,217,800 $1,067,800\nUnited Way Contributions $5,532,470 $5,378,890 $5,200,000\n Employee contributions $2,766,235 $2,666,945 $2,600,000\n Company contributions $2,766,235 $2,711,945 $2,600,000\nMatching Gifts Program $1,321,317 $1,323,542 $1,114,597\n Employee contributions $720,862 $710,634 $586,262\n Company contributions $600,455 $612,908 $528,335\nVolunteer Matching Dollars $247,735 $163,150 $129,549\nDisaster Relief $30,000 $50,000 $10,000\nOther Contributions $ 2,005,287 $3,001,753 $2,682,801\nIn-kind Contributions $111,079 $217,118 $103,934\nTotal $13,176,158 $14,191,518 $12,942,581\nEmployee Volunteer Hours 31,018 28,263 28,415Find information about the  \nXcel Energy Foundation and grant \nfocus areas on our website.Check online for more information", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XEL_2011.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
