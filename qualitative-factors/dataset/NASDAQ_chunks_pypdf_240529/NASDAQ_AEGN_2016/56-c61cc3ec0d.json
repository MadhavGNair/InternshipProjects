We are active investment \nmanagers with capabilities in fixed income, equities, property, multi -\nasset, absolute return and ethical investing. We have a s table and \nexperienced team of 97  investment professionals, who have an \naverage experience of 19 years, of which an average of eight years \nhas been spent with Kames Capital. They have managed portfolios \nacross nume rous market cycles and have the skill and judgment to make the right investment \ndecisions for our clients.  \nAs a business w e embrace sustainability as a corporate objective and it is central to our strategy \nand culture. This e nsures we aspire to meet the same standards for our own business as we \ndemand of the companies in which we invest.  \nWe also believe it is our responsibility to encourage companies to maximise investment returns through \ngood governance practices, including respect for society and the environment. As a significant \nshareholder in many companies, we are well -placed to actively promote best -practice in environmental, \nsocial and governance  (\u2018ESG\u2019)  matters. Evidence suggests that companies which  rank among the \nleaders in sustainability tend to  outperform as investments over the long term.  \nThis responsible investment policy provides a framework for overseeing the performance of the \ncompanies in which we invest. In particular, it deals with our responsibilities, as set out by the \nFinancial Report ing Council\u2019s UK Stewardship Code  and the Japanese Stewardship Code \nalthough we endeavour to apply the same principles to all client holdings regardless of their listing \nor domicile .  \nPrinciples \nWe recognise that companies  operate under significantly diffe rent conditions . So we endeavour to \nbe reasonable and pragmatic in our approach to corporate governance, giving due consideration \nto each company\u2019s specific circumstances and the market in which it operates.  \nAs a general policy, as active investors, we support the management of the companies in which \nwe invest. W here aspects of a company\u2019s governance fall short of our expectations, we encourage \nimprovements through engagement  to increase or protect the value of our clients\u2019 investme nts. \nWhere appropri ate, we vote against management to protect  our clients\u2019 best interest s.  \nWe will repor t in a transparent manner on our  responsible investment activities.  \nActive memberships \nAs an active member of The Investment Association\u2019s Governance and Engagement Co mmittee, \nKames Capital is actively involved in formulating UK corporate governance best practice.
