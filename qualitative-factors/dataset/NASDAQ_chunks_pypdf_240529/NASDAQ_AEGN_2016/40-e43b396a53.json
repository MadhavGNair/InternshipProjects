{"page_content": "Companies Featured in the SRI Funds\nBased on its new SRI methodology, LBPAM invested in a number of new companies, including \nKoninklijke Wessanen, a food company that produces and markets healthy and sustainable products. With growing consensus that consumption of animal products has a highly negative impact on the environment and human health, vegetarian products account for 97% of Wessanen's product range. LBPAM also invested in Gamesa, a Spanish developer and constructor of wind turbines and the construction of windfarms. The company has installed more than 10,000 MW of production in four continents, saving the equivalent of 51.9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. \nKames Capital invested in Mohawk Industries Inc., a good example of a company that thematic \nsustainability funds are unlikely to identify if just screening by revenue exposure. Mohawk is an American carpet and flooring company but has integrated sustainability into its operational practices by investing heavily (USD 500m) in plastic bottle recycling facilities (Mohawk is the largest recycler of plastic bottles in the US). The investment reduces Mohawk\u2019s exposure to volatile oil based inputs and provides it with a cost advantage versus peers in what is a fairly commoditized market.
