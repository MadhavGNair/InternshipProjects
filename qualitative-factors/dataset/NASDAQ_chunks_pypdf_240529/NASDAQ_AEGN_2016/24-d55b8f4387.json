We have impact \ninvestments in affordable housing and elderly homes, renewable energy, sustainable timber, microfinance, development \nbanks and green bonds.\nSRI funds\nSRI funds offer investment strategies that often revolve around exclusions for a specific ESG issue, or a combination of \nESG issues. For example, companies with poor environmental or human rights records, or companies that are active in \nthe arms or tobacco industries may be excluded from investment considerations. Aegon Asset Management currently \noffers a number of SRI funds in the UK, the Netherlands and Hungary. Our joint venture partners LBPAM (France) and \nAIFMC (China) are also active in SRI Funds.\nInvest in People\nSince 2013 TKPI has been helping blind track cyclist, \nTristan Bangma, achieve his dream of competing in the Paralympics.
