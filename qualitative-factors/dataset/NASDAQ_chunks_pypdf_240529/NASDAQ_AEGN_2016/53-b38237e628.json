andseveral of our business units have developed more detailed policies tailored to local practices and governance principles. The majority of issues we vote on are related to governance. However, as our engagement activities have expanded in scope we are also voting more on issues related to health, the environment and human rights. \nThe cases below illustrate how Aegon Asset Management \ndeals with analysis and decision-making around exercising its shareholder rights. Our individual units Aegon Asset Management NL, Kames Capital and TKP Investments disclose their voting records in more detail (see theAppendix for QR links).defense companies, are at the other end. This makes it difficult for Aegon Asset Management to draw a single line that will be acceptable to all of our stakeholders. \nFinally, a discussion took place about the legitimacy of imposing \ninvestment exclusion lists on Third Party clients. In the Netherlands this is considered acceptable, perhaps even best-practice, whereas in most other countries where Aegon Asset Management has businesses this would be considered a clear conflict with investment and fiduciary duty principles, especially if the exclusion norms are not clearly based on globally accepted standards.\nAegon\u2019s Responsible Investment policies were reviewed and \ndiscussed at this meeting, and it was concluded that they can be considered to meet stakeholders\u2019 expectations broadly. It was agreed that Aegon should continue to monitor the debate around nuclear weapons and its position in this area.\nA take-away from the roundtable discussion was that as a\nlarge international financial services company with different types of activities and clients in more than 20 countries, it is difficult to fully satisfy the demands of all of our stakeholders. Nonetheless, we consider this to be an excellent format forin-dept engagement with multiple stakeholders on a singleissue and are planning to have more roundtable discussionslike this in the future.
