In many cases, Responsible Investment is already a regular agenda item in discussions with these managers, but especially in asset classes where ESG understanding is less developed (like infrastructure, hedge funds, REITs) we feel we could do more.\nWe are currently compiling an inventory of all external managers that Aegon N.V. and Aegon Asset \nManagement units work with and will approach them systematically. We expect to report on our findings starting in next year\u2019s report.8.1 Investment Analysis\nAt Aegon Asset Management, we believe integrating ESG into our investment\nstrategies allows us to improve our risk management and investment capabilities. \nESG integration means taking ESG factors into account in investment analysis and \ndecision-making. Our investment professionals are required to complete ESG \ntraining in order to identify where ESG risks may impact our investments, as well \nas seek opportunities to optimize investments from an ESG perspective.
