{"page_content": "Next Steps in SRI Funds\nAll Aegon Asset Management colleagues working on SRI funds are passionate about their \nproduct and are enthusiastic about market opportunities, benefits for clients and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 having an impact through investments. Marianne comments, \"The investment fund is subject to economies of scale. We are convinced that as more participants will invest, and assets under management increase, the costs measured in terms of basis points will reduce significantly.\" \nPaul explains that LBPAM would like to do more to measure how the fund is contributing to global \nchallenges, \"LBPAM already discloses some extra-financial and impact indicators for the funds, and LBAPM has also developed tools to publish the performance of SRI Funds compared to their benchmarks on ESG raw data. We also plan to significantly improve on these indicators and extend these activities in 2017.\"\nRoger is aiming to finalize his project to develop the ESG benchmark for the passive equity portfolio \nin 2017. \"We still have a lot of logistical hoops we have to jump through, and all the departments involved have their questions and requirements. But the portfolio is very large, which makes it all worthwhile. That is why I think our integrative approach works: we make ESG part of the very large portfolios that we manage. It is hard work but in the end you know that the impact will be huge. That is very rewarding.\"\n79\nThe objective is to achieve a return that is close to the\nMSCI World SRI benchmark. It is constructed by applying abest-in-class ESG selection strategy to companies from the MSCI World Index universe. This includes companies with a minimum ESG ratings of \u2018A\u2019 and excludes companies with a score lower than \u2018BB\u2019. The benchmark represents approximately 25% of the market capitalization in each sector and region of the parent index, after exclusions are applied. \nExclusions: Any companies involved in alcohol, tobacco, \ngambling, civilian firearms, military weapons, nuclear power, \nadult entertainment and genetically modified organisms (GMOs).EUR 80 m\nMM World Equity Index SRI Fund\nTKP Investments\nSRI Approach: Launched November 2016,\nthe fund is a \u2018Developed World Equity\u2019\ninvestment fund with a passive\ninvestment strategy. SRI Fund \u2013 Fast Facts\nWe use our investment management expertise to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security.\n78\nWe use our investment management expertise to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security.TKP Investments looked into this question for its client by tracking performance of the index it selected for the fund and found that over a time period from 2007 to 2015 the benchmark of the TKP Investments MM World Equity Index SRI Fund performed as well as the parent index, but with a lower degree of volatility (risk). TKP Investments also looked at the diversification in the index (sector and region), a metric that helps determine performance potential. TKP Investments concluded that with approximately 400 holdings, the MSCI World SRI Index Fund offers sufficient diversification benefits. \nBecause it has an actively managed fund, the LBPAM approach \nis slightly different from the TKPI one. Benoit believes that identifying companies and businesses that manage resources responsibly and have high-quality governance will improve long-term performance and reduce reputational and financial risks. According to Benoit,\"Our approach sets us up well to understand long-term challenges, we focus on identifying companies and sectors that offer solutions and innovation to the main ESG challenges.\" Identifying ESG momentum Kames Capital went a step further in analyzing the question about investment performance for SRI funds. As part of the sustainability analysis of companies for its Global Sustainablefund, it classifies companies as ESG leaders, improvers and laggards (the latter being un-investable). \nRyan commented, \"For \u2018improvers\u2019 we outline the key ESG \nperformance indicators that we feel are important for a company and which we will track going forward to measure their improvement process. There is strong evidence that investing in ESG \u2018improvers\u2019 is an effective way of integrating ESG into investment processes. Such an approach avoids the biases that many best-in-class approaches suffer from \u2013 such as value, large-cap, European, lack of emerging markets \u2013 and provides a larger opportunity set. Focusing on \u2018improvers\u2019 also fits well with our own experience of working with companies on traditional corporate governance issues as they grow from IPO to full listing.\"\nSweat the small stuff\nFinally, all of our colleagues working to build SRI funds point to operational challenges, and to the importance of minimizing costs. For instance, TKP Investments had to decide on the most cost-efficient way for the client to migrate from the original world equity allocation to the SRI allocation, while maintaining full exposure to the equity market during the transfer period. Marianne explains how they \"decided to do an in-kind transaction for close to the total original equity value, which was then followed by a buy-and-sell strategy in units for the remaining equity value. The second transaction was really used to optimize currency hedges and to determine the desired distribution between both the hedged and unhedged investment fund.\" \nRoger is also grappling with this issue. As he points out,\"Once \nwe apply the ESG benchmark there needs to be a transition where we\u2019re selling securities and buying others on a fairly large scale. Of course this comes with transaction costs, but we want to minimize them \u2013 otherwise we could easily erase potential performance benefits from the ESG approach by incurring these transaction costs.\" The solution can probably be found in opting for a longer transition period and having trades coincide with rebalancing \u2013 the periodic buying and selling of assets that ensures the fund matches with the benchmark.\n\" It is hard work but in the end you know that the impact\nwill be huge. That is very rewarding.\"", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2016.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
