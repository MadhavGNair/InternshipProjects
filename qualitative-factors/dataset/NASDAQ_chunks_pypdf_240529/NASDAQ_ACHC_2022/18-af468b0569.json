Together, \nthey manage the risks related to hazardous \nmaterials and waste and ensure effective \nenvironmental management at their facility. We \nhave detailed policies, trainings, and procedures \nregarding the storage, handling, and disposal of \nwaste products, hazardous waste, and other \nregulated materials to ensure compliance with all \napplicable laws and regulations. For The Joint \nCommission (TJC) accredited facilities, we also \nconduct external audits for compliance with TJC \nhazardous-waste  regulations.\nOur Risk Management Incident Reporting program \nprovides for the immediate reporting of any unsafe \nstorage or improper disposal or release of a \nhazardous or toxic substance.\nReducing Our Environmental Impact\nIn addition to adhering to environmental laws and \nregulations, we also look to reduce our biggest \noverall environmental impact: the use of energy \nin our buildings.\nMechanical-Electrical-Plumbing (MEP) Systems:   \nFor all new Acadia facilities and renovations, we \nspecify the use of MEP systems that achieve facility \nenergy performance higher than typical systems. \nWe implement data-driven designs in new \nbuildings to achieve low energy use targets that \nare 20% more efficient than typical behavioral \nhealth hospitals.We understand our responsibility \nto help protect the environment. \nWe seek to minimize the \nenvironmental impact of our \noperations, and we are \ncommitted to complying with \nenvironmental laws and \nregulations.\nLighting Designs:  In our new construction and \nrenovations, we specify lighting designs that are \ntypically over 30% more efficient than code and \ninclude all Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting.\nHeating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):  \nWe create efficiencies with power usage and \nheating by rightsizing our HVAC.\nPlumbing:  Our new building designs have \nplumbing systems that consume 30% less water \nthan code requirements.\nEnergy Conservation:  All newly constructed \nAcadia hospitals exceed the requirements of the \nInternational Energy Conservation Code (IECC). \nOur corporate headquarters are in a LEED-\ncertified  building.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACHC_2022.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
