Our high-reliability principles provide \nan effective, proactive way of thinking about safety and \nquality. We believe that we achieve this through consistent \nsupport and collaboration with facilities and staff, \ncontinuous monitoring of services, and strategic \npartnerships with accrediting and \nregulatory  organizations.\nAlthough the facilities within the Acadia network operate \nwith a significant degree of independence, their ability to \ndeliver quality care is enhanced by our national Quality \nand Compliance teams, led by our Chief Medical Officer, \nChief Quality Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer, who \nhave oversight of quality, regulatory clinical initiatives, \nand legal and regulatory compliance. Acadia also has a \ndedicated team of professionals who lead our risk \nmanagement program and work closely with our \nfacility and clinic risk managers. \nWe work continually to improve our culture of \nsafety, and we strive for zero patient harm . \nIn addition to our facility-based safety practices, \nwe have undertaken several initiatives to ensure \nthat our commitment to safety is integrated \nthroughout our organization, including the \nfollowing:\nCORPORATE QUALITY COMMITTEE  \nOur Corporate Quality Committee evaluates \nquality and safety risks to our patients and \nemployees, as well as revises existing \ncorporate policies and/or develops new \npolicies, as  needed.\nZERO TOLERANCE TRAINING  \nEvery Acadia employee completes zero \ntolerance training upon being hired and \nour field employees complete the \ntraining on an annual basis thereafter. \nThis training is focused on defining and \npreventing abuse, neglect, boundary \nviolations, and exploitation. The training \nincludes a mandatory test each year, \nwith a required passing grade of 100%.\nAcadia Healthcare | 2022 Sustainability Report   10HOW WE ACHIEVE  \nPATIENT SATISFACTION\nEvaluating the success of \nbehavioral healthcare treatment \nis always a challenge.
