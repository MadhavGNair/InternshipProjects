{"page_content": "Performance Highlights\nWe are proud to report zero cases of non-compliance regarding \nhuman rights and fair labour in 2021, both within our internal \noperations as well as within our supply chain. \nTo the best of our knowledge, none of our direct suppliers or \ntheir suppliers for our products are based in or conduct their \nprincipal business activities in a location that is the subject of \nallegations of forced labour.\nLooking Forward\nIn addition to having a zero-tolerance policy for any violations \nof human and labour rights, we continue to monitor current \nand emerging regulations and industry best practices. We will \ncontinue to improve our internal policies and controls, as well as \nmaintain close relationships with our suppliers to ensure they \ncontinue to comply with the law. We are currently in the process \nof launching our modern slavery training. \nTo continue managing the ethical behaviour of our supply chain, \ncountries deemed as high-risk will be evaluated through our \nmulti-step risk assessment methodology, working across our \nsupply chain to mitigate risks. Should issues arise, we will engage specialists, both internal and external, to assist us in risk \nassessment and remediation measures.\nAnother goal moving forward is to increase traceability of our \nsupply chain, by putting it on the blockchain. \nIn setting our long-term targets for ESG, our goal by 2025 is for \ninformation about traceability of supply on blockchain to be made \navailable within four hours. By 2030, we aim to maintain zero \ncases of verified non-compliance with human rights laws with \nenhanced traceability.SOCIAL\nFair Labour and Human Rights\nZero cases\nof non-compliance\nin 2021\n\u00a9 2022 Maxeon Solar Technologies\n54\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2021.pdf", "page": 53, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
