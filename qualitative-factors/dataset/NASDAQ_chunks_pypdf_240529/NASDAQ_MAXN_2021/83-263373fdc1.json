Through a collaborative \nand innovative approach, Maxeon strives to work with and \ninfluence its suppliers to curate novel solutions and operating \nprocedures that enable the efficient use of materials. Furthermore, \nwe seek to innovate our reliable and efficient solar technology to \nenable our customers to achieve greener practices, through their \ntransition towards solar power. Collaboration with Solar Energy Research institute  \nof Singapore (SERIS)\nTo further our sustainability journey, Maxeon \nis currently collaborating on two research \nprojects with the Solar Energy Research \nInstitute of Singapore (SERIS) at the National \nUniversity of Singapore (NUS).\nThe first collaboration focuses on developing, deploying and \napplying photovoltaics in  the dense and urban environment of \nSingapore. These Urban Solar solutions will propel Singapore and \nother cities towards achieving self-sustaining communities. \nThe second collaboration quantifies the benefits that high-\nefficiency PV modules, such as those produced by Maxeon,  \ncan have on the levelized cost of electricity in a tropical city  \nlike Singapore.\n\u00a9 2022 Maxeon Solar Technologies\n84\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2021.pdf", "page": 83, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
