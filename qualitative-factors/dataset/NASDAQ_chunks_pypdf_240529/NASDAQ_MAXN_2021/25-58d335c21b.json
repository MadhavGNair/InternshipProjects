{"page_content": "Performance Highlights\nIn 2021, we consumed 240,832 MWh of energy across all our \nmanufacturing sites. Our total emissions are estimated at \n150,303 tCO2e, comprising Scope 1 (580 tCO2e), Scope 2 (149,282 \ntCO2e) and Scope 3 (441 tCO2e) emissions. Our Scope 3 boundary \nis currently limited to Business Travel (Category 6) and Employee \nCommute (Category 7).\nIn 2021, our performance resulted in an energy intensity of 268 \nMWh per MW produced and an emissions intensity of 167 tCO2e \nper MW produced. While our overall energy consumption and our \noverall GHG emissions saw a reduction from 2020, our energy \nintensity as well as our emissions intensity saw an increase. This is \nprimarily due to the decreased MW production output, showing a \n17% decrease in MW produced in 2021, compared to 2020.\nThrough our production capacity of solar solutions, we have \nachieved the avoidance of an estimated 8,413,603 tCO2e  \nin 2021.\n* Calculated using EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies CalculatorEnergy and EmissionsENVIRONMENTAL\nEquivalent to negating greenhouse gas emissions from:\n1.8 million  \nPassenger vehicles driven  \nfor one year  2.2 million  \nPassenger vehicles driven \nfor one year  \nEquivalent to carbon sequestered by:\n8,413,603 tCO2e\navoided emissions*\n1.6 million  \nHomes' electricity use\nfor one year\n139 million  \nTree seedlings grown  \nfor 10 years10 million  \nAcres of U.S. forests  \nin one year1 trillion\nNumber of\nsmartphones charged\n\u00a9 2022 Maxeon Solar Technologies\n26\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2021.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
