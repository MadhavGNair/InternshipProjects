{"page_content": "GOVERNANCE\nCustomer Engagement and Satisfaction\nPerformance Highlights\nCustomer satisfaction is paramount to our corporate purpose \nand sustainability ambitions. \nWe employ a Net Promoter Scores (NPS) system to track the \nloyalty of our customers. The NPS is measured on a scale of  \n1 to 10, and customers who provide us with a rating of 9 or \n10 are called \u2018Promoters,\u2019 as they are more likely to advocate \nor recommend our products. Customers who rate us a 7 or \n8 are referred to as \u2018Passives\u2019 as they are satisfied customers \nwithout great inclination to promote the company and its \nofferings. Customers who rate us at 6 or below are considered \n\"Detractors\" as these respondents are not satisfied and \nmay potentially share their negative perceptions. The NPS is \ncalculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the \npercentage of Promoters. Scores above 0 are considered good \nand those above 50 are excellent.72\n57\n20170204080\n60\n2018 2019 2020 2021NPS SCORES OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS\nPartner Health Customer Health\n\u00a9 2022 Maxeon Solar Technologies\n91\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAXN_2021.pdf", "page": 90, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
