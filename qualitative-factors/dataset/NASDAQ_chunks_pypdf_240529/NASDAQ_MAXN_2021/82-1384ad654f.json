In addition to meeting the \ncertification requirements, our panels frequently outperform \nthese standards. For example, our IBC panels can generate up to \n30% more energy in the same space over 25 years as compared \nto conventional panels1.\nMaxeon has remained compliant and experienced zero cases \nof non-compliance with all regulations and voluntary codes \nconcerning the health and safety impacts of products and \nservices offered within the reporting period.\nLooking Forward\nWe remain committed to delivering excellent solar panels as \ndemonstrated by their quality, reliability, durability and safety. We \naim to accomplish this by regularly engaging with stakeholders \nand staying abreast of emerging industry trends, to further our \ninnovative processes and reach unparalleled heights.  \n1.
