{"page_content": "Our compliance strategy instils a risk-based approach which \naligns with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), whilst \nour annual training and certifications on our Code of Conduct \ninclude labour rights practices. Maxeon requires compliance \ncertifications from all our suppliers in alignment with the Office \nof Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of \nTreasury to reduce the risk of exposure for breaches of our \npolicies and procedures. If increased risk is identified, Maxeon \nconducts enhanced due diligence and grants specialised \ncertifications on supplier operations and labour practices, \nthereby minimising our risk exposure on identified issues.\nMaxeon has separately provided a Modern Slavery Statement   \nunder the Australian law for the year 2021.\nSupply Chain Management \nMaxeon considers its supply chain partners as an extension of \nthe company.
