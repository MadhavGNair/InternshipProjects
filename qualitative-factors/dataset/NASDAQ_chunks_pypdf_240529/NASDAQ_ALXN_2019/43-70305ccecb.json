In early clinical trials, Caelum\u2019s drug candidate CAEL-101 has been shown to trigger a rapid  \nand clinically relevant organ response. Alexion and Caelum are working to design future  \nclinical trials, and CAEL-101 has received  \nan Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S.  \nFood and Drug Administration.\nAlexion is working with Zealand Pharma  \nA/S, which is discovering and developing \ninnovative peptide-based medicines.  \nWith an initial investment of $25 million,  \nAlexion has partnered with Zealand   \nto focus on a novel peptide therapy  \nfor complement-mediated diseases. \n Working with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals,   \nwe are discovering and developing RNAi therapies for complement-mediated  \ndiseases. The collaboration allows us  \nto build on our complement leadership  \nand expand into RNAi-based therapies.  \nIn 2019, we expanded our partnership  \nto include four targets.\nAlexion announced an agreement in 2019 \nwith BridgeBio Pharma\u2019s subsidiary Eidos \nTherapeutics that grants Alexion an exclusive license to develop and commercialize AG10,  \na therapy in Japan that treats the root cause  \nof a rare protein disorder.  \nWe are partnering with Complement  \nPharma to advance a preclinical C6  \ncomplement inhibitor for potential  \ntreatments for a variety of neurological  \ndisorders.In 2017, we entered into a license agreement   \nwith Halozyme Therapeutics and since then \nhave completed a Phase 1 study of ALXN1210  \nco-administered with Halozyme's ENHANZE\n\u00ae \ndrug-delivery technology, which aids in the \ndispersion and absorption of injected therapies, yielding a next-generation formulation called ALXN1810.  \nACQUIRING  \nACHILLION \nPHARMACEUTICALS\nIn early 2020, Alexion \ncompleted its acquisition  \nof Achillion Pharmaceuticals  \nproviding the foundation and expertise for a broader oral Factor D inhibition development platform with  \nthe potential to treat numerous additional complement-mediated diseases and strengthening our pipeline portfolio of rare disease.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2019.pdf", "page": 43, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
