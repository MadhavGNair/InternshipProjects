In 2019, we advanced that priority by deploying the Alexion Leadership Profile\u25ba \nThis approach:\n\u2022\n Builds upon Ale\nxion\u2019s leadership \ndifferentiators: Change Lives, Create  \nValue and Collaborate to Innovate. \n\u2022\n Defin\nes the attributes and behaviors we \nexpect of leaders at all levels of  \nthe organization. \n\u2022\n Guides all of our people decisions: what\n  \nwe select for, who we hire, who we  \npartner with, how we measure  \nperformance and potential, and what  \nwe prioritize in our individual and  \ncollective development efforts. \nThe launch of our Leadership Profile inspired several training pilots, including a new Manager Development Pilot Program that enlisted  \na cross-functional group of Alexion managers  \nto participate in seven experiential modules. Based on the pilot\u2019s success, we plan to deliver this program to Alexion managers on a regular basis, enhancing the program as we receive feedback from attendees. \nThe Leadership Profile also provided the \nframework and structure for a new Enterprise Leadership training launched in 2019. We piloted the program for all General Managers, Global Medicine Team Leads and Global Program Team Leads. We will continue to roll out the program  \nto senior leaders across the company in 2020. In addition, key leaders participated  \nin our Purpose-Driven Leadership  \nprogram \u2013 an intensive, experiential learning program that required those leaders to work together on a critical company project. \nIn parallel with our training and \ndevelopment programs, we strive  \nto provide employees the resources  \nthey need, playing to their strengths  \nand aspirations. As part of that effort, we have built 360-degree assessment instruments for all levels, based on the key behaviors that make up our Leadership Profile. We also equip our  \nmanagers with tools they need to have meaningful conversations with their  \nemployees about their performance,  \npotential and development.\nFor our Enterprise Leadership Team,  \nwe developed a specific assessment  \nand development toolkit that focuses  \non seven specific behaviors. These behaviors \nwere identified as critical by the Alexion Executive Committee for enterprise leadership.\nWe offer employees at all levels a variety  \nof tailored training opportunities through  \nour Learning Management System (LMS) and \noffer up to $10,000 per year in tuition assistance  \nfor those pursuing degrees or courses that will benefit their current or future roles at Alexion. \n100% \nOF EMPLOYEES \nPARTICIPATED in \nPERFORMANCE \nREVIEWS IN 2019 \nOUR PEOPLE\u2019S VALUESPATIENTS ARE OUR \nGUIDING STAR\nChange\nLives\nCollaborate\nto InnovateCreate \nValue\nGet \nThings \nDoneInvest \nin\nYourself\nBuild \nNext \nGenerationShape \nthe \nFutureEngage \nToday\u2019s \nTalent OUR\nLEADERS\u2019\nBEHAVIORSACT WITH INTEGRITY\nEMPOWER PEOPLESERVE PATIENTSINNOVATE FOR SOLUTIONS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2019.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
