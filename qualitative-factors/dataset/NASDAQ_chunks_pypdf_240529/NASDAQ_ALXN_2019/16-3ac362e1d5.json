The Alexion Charitable \nFoundation focuses most of its resources  \non Rare BelongingTM funding priorities.  \nHowever, a portion of its funding goes  \nto organizations in the communities where Alexion has a major presence, but without the strict requirement of benefiting the rare disease community. \nLocal Needs funding focuses on helping people \nwho are disadvantaged or disenfranchised. This enables the Foundation to positively impact the communities where we live and work. Examples of initiatives that might be supported include:\n\u2022\n A\ndvancing emotional well-being through \nmental health and other social services. \n\u2022\n A\ndvancing educational opportunities \nthrough basic education, science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education, job readiness and other skills.\n\u2022\n A\ndvancing the cause of diversity and \ninclusion in society and critical institutions.Corporate Giving. The guidelines for Alexion\u2019s Corporate Giving program are similar in focus to the Local Needs Grants of the Alexion Charitable Foundation. Alexion\u2019s Corporate Giving mission is to positively impact our local communities \u2014 with a particular focus on people who are disadvantaged or disenfranchised \u2014 through initiatives that advance emotional well-being, provide educational opportunities and promote diversity and inclusion in society and critical institutions. \nAs a company, Alexion\u2019s positive impact \nreaches beyond just the dollars we contribute. We also aim to positively affect people affected by a rare disease through initiatives such as  \nour Diagnostics Strategy (Page 42), Research  \nand Medical Education (Page 45), Patient Organization Support (Page 28) and  \nPatient Support Programs (Page 27). \nRare BelongingTM unifies a suite of funding priorities  \nto benefit people affected by a rare disease \u2013 including \npatients, their families and caregivers.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2019.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
