Our ambition \nis to move a portion of our manufacturing in-house. We are currently seeking regulatory approval for two recently completed biologics facilities in Ireland. This shift, commenced in 2019, will change our direct environmental footprint. We plan to use 2020 data to create a baseline from which we can set metrics in the areas  \nof emissions, energy, water and waste.  \n2018-2019 environmental data includes Alexion\u2019s  \nfacilities in Ireland, New Haven, Connecticut,  \nand two manufacturing plants in the U.S. \nCO\u2082e = carbon dioxide equivalent \nAll greenhouse gas emissions are measured in metric tons \nof carbon dioxide equivalent (metric tons CO\n\u2082e) an\nd follow \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Fourth Assessment. Information provided for Scope 2 is gross market-based. Gross location-based accounting for all in-scope sites is 12.39 1,000 metric tons.\nFor Scope 1, all U.S. sites are calculated using the following \nformula: Natural Gas (mmBtu Nat Gas x Emissions Factor [53.06 kg CO\n\u2082e]) + F\nuel Oil Generators (mmBtu Fuel Oil x \nEmissions Factor [73.96 kg CO\n\u2082e]) x 0\n.001 (conversion factor \nfor kilograms to metric tons).\nFor Scope 2, sites in Northeastern U.S. are calculated using \nthe following formula: Electricity (MWh) x Emissions Factor (558.2 lb./MWh) x 0.000453 metric tons/lb. (conversion factor for pounds to metric tons).\nFor Scope 2, the Georgia, U.S. site is calculated using the \nfollowing formula: Electricity (MWh) x Emissions Factor (1089.4 lb./MWh) x 0.000453 metric tons/lb. (conversion factor for pounds to metric tons).", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2019.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
