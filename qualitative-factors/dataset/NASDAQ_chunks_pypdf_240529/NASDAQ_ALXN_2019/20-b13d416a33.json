Process waste is a byproduct of researching, developing and manufacturing lifesaving medicines. We aim to minimize process waste wherever feasible and practical by eliminating or reducing, reusing and recycling material where possible, and recovering, treating and disposing of material if other options are not technically feasible. Our Ireland-based facilities have achieved zero waste-to-landfill for all their waste streams, including that from cafeteria  \nfood service. \nFor additional information, please visit our website at www.bestpl.us or call us at 1-844-200-BEST(2378) .\nFeatures & Benefits:\nWaterproofDoes not absorb or \nleach toxic chemicals\nCompatible with \ncommon equipment and toolsImpervious to all insectsNo splinters or cracking\nSolid color through\nthe whole product\nMaintenance free: no painting, staining, or sealingMade with recycled plasticWill not rot or decay\nMade in the USAIdeal for organic gardeningUV Stabilized Colors\nFor additional information, please visit our website at www.bestpl.us or call us at 1-844-200-BEST(2378) .\nFeatures & Benefits:\nWaterproofDoes not absorb or \nleach toxic chemicals\nCompatible with \ncommon equipment and toolsImpervious to all insectsNo splinters or cracking\nSolid color through\nthe whole product\nMaintenance free: no painting, staining, or sealingMade with recycled plasticWill not rot or decay\nMade in the USAIdeal for organic gardeningUV Stabilized Colors\n\u25b2 Plastic recycled from our New Haven \nfacility  is turned into park benches, pallets, \nspeed bumps and other beneficial uses. \u25bc ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2019.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
