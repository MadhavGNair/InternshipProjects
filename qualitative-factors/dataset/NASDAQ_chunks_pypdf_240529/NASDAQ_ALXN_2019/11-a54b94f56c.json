Even though these formal aspirations and metrics were recently established, our teams have been committed to many of these areas of focus since the company\u2019s founding. For most areas, 2019 will serve as the baseline year against which we will measure progress, with the exception of two environmental metrics for which the baseline year will be 2020. Moving forward, we plan to report yearly progress against these aspirations in our annual CSR report.
