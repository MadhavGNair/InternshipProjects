There are a variety of ways to keep the workplace safe, including establishing procedures to collect and review information about known or potential hazards in the workplace, investigating the root cause of those hazards, and prioritizing hazard controls. Identifying and correcting these hazards proactively ensures that workers go home, after every shift, to their families safe and sound.\nSafe + Sound is a year-round campaign to encourage every workplace to have a \nsafety and health program. This nationwide effort raises awareness of the value of workplace safety and health programs, which can improve businesses\u2019 safety and health performance, save money, and improve competitiveness.\nFor the latest news and information visit www.osha.gov/safeandsound.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2019.pdf", "page": 38, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
