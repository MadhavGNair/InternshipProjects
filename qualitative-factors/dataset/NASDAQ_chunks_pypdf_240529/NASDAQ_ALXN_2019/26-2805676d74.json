The complexity of living  \nwith a rare condition can compound the difficulty. Our patient support programs are designed  \nwith the patient journey in mind. In 2019, we established an aspiration to increase the percentage  \nof eligible patients who have been diagnosed with a condition that Alexion treats, that are included  \nin Alexion patient support programs year over year, regardless of whether they are using our therapies. \nIn international markets, including Japan, nearly 70% of new patient support programs established  \nin 2019 included patients not currently on Alexion therapies.\nMeet Tanner\nWhen Tanner was born, his \nmother, Ren\u00e9, did not suspect anything was wrong with him. Then, doctors noticed his wrists were retracting, and he had an unusual amount of cartilage. Diagnosed with HPP, doctors told Ren\u00e9 that Tanner had  \na 50% chance of survival. With  \nno approved therapy for HPP,  \nhe participated in a clinical trial for STRENSIQ\n\u00ae (asfotase alfa). \nYears later, Tanner is doing well and continues to receive treatment with STRENSIQ.  \nLearn more of Tanner\u2019s story . EDUCATING \nPATIENTS AROUND \nthe WORLD\nAlexion is committed to educating patients  \nabout their disease by providing patient support \nprograms that help people living with a rare disease to \nbetter manage their symptoms, understand their treatment \nand improve their overall health. Efforts in 2019 included:\n\u25ba In Austria and Germany, we created an educational brochure  \non gMG for patients around the world, with patient input  \non content and format. The brochure has been rolled out  \nin Austria, Canada, Germany, Japan and Switzerland. \n\u25ba For those living with PNH in Japan, we\u2019ve developed  \na mobile app to help patients record their symptoms \nand share information directly with their \nphysicians. We also created a \u201cmovie book\u201d to \nexplain PNH and its treatment through  \nplain-language videos.\nAira, living \nwith HPP", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2019.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
