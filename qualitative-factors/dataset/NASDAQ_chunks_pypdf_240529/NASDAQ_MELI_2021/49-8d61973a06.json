We help with initiatives and training \nprograms that promote access to jobs, entrepreneurship, and more inclusive futures. \nTechnology enables us to bring development opportunities to populations that are \nunderrepresented in this area so that they can discover the potential it has for them, \nand drive positive change for themselves and their communities.\nOur educational initiatives are aimed at developing key skills, which are not limited \nto technical competencies, but also include socioemotional skills that allow self-\nknowledge and the definition of a life and career plan, as well as the connection with \nreal problems in the communities, where each young person can be an agent of \nchange. We have diverse training proposals, through which the work with specialized \norganizations adds value to our proposal and enhances results.SOCIAL IMPACT\nWe are acting today to foster \nmore inclusive development \nin Latin America.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2021.pdf", "page": 49, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
