A central part of that management is \nmeasuring our carbon footprint, allowing us to identify and implement reduction \nactions with agility, accompanying business development. \nWe have been measuring our footprint since 2016, with increasingly accurate \nindicators. As a result, we have achieved real-time impact monitoring that allows \nus to anticipate and act to reduce emissions. The exercise covers our operations \nand value chain (scope 1, 2, and 3).\nWe follow the measurement guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) \nstandard developed jointly by the World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment (WBCSD) and the World Resource Institute (WRI).GHG INTENSITY\nPER EMPLOYEE43.2 tn CO2e\nPER BUYER0.019 tn CO2e\nPER USER0.0093 tn CO2eGREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY OUR CARBON\nFOOTPRINT\ntn CO2e1,293,925SCOPE 2\n+88.94% over 202011,510 tn CO2e\nSCOPE 3\n+125.65% over 2020938,861 tn CO2e\nSCOPE 1\n+225.23% over 2020343,554 tn CO2e A STRATEGY IN MOTIONENVIRONMENT\n58\nIMPACT REPORT\nABOUT THIS REPORT\nBUSINESS\nUSERS\nOUR TEAM\nGRI, SASB & IR STANDARDS\nSOCIAL IMPACT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2021.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
