And one in four is led by a \nwoman. We were able to help hundreds of \nthousands of these SMEs to recover by \nproviding technologies and solutions \nthat facilitated their rapid adaptation \nto the new context. In 2021, more than \n1000 million products were sold on our \nplatform, representing sales over USD \n28.300 million.\nWe continued working to strengthen \nthe democratization of payments and \nthe expansion of new financial services \npromoted by Mercado Pago, favoring \ninclusion and promoting formalization. \nWe reached 51.5 million unique fintech \nusers, and 3254 million transactions \nwere carried out securely.\nMercado Cr\u00e9dito continued to prove \nitself as a source of financing for those \nwho had never before had access \nto credit in the traditional banking \nsystem, exceeding USD 3800 million \nin loans granted in Mexico, Brazil, and \nArgentina, with a strong inclusion effect: \n50% went to SMEs that had never \nreceived financing before.\nWith Mercado Env\u00edos, we managed to \ndeliver packages throughout the region \nwithin 24 hours. Advances in the speed \nand delivery capacity of our network \nare transforming the e-commerce \nexperience and delivering on our \npromise to close socioeconomic and \ngeographic gaps. In 2021, we opened new warehousing \nand distribution centers in Mexico \nand Brazil, representing about \n600,000 m2 and generating more \nthan 7,100 new jobs.\nIn 2021, we also reinforced our long-\nterm commitment to the sustainability \nagenda with the issuance of our first \nSustainability Bond, raising a total of \nUSD 400 million that will allow us to \naccelerate our investments in initiatives \nto reduce our environmental footprint, \nboost financial inclusion, and drive \nempowerment through education.\nThe Regenera Am\u00e9rica program is a \nclear demonstration of this commitment: \nan initiative that promotes the \nregeneration and preservation of Latin \nAmerica\u2019s iconic biomes, helping to \nensure their carbon capturing capacity, \nessential to mitigating the climate crisis \nand protecting our biodiversity. We \nstarted with the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, \nwith two projects aimed at restoring \nmore than 3,000 hectares. \nWe also accelerated our sustainable \nmobility agenda. In 2021, we quintupled \nour fleet of electric vehicles and \nmigrated two of our main distribution \ncenters in Brazil to 100% renewable \nenergy: Cajamar and Louveira.We remain committed to generating \nopportunities in the communities where \nwe operate, accompanying social \norganizations and working with different \neducation and technology organizations \nto open the doors of the knowledge \nindustry to many more people. More \nthan 5,000 boys and girls were \ntrained and introduced to the world of \ntechnology to discover new possibilities \nfor the future.\nTwenty-two years ago, from a garage \nin Buenos Aires, we set out to \ndemocratize electronic commerce \nand payments in the region. In this \nreport, we share the progress of our \ncommitments; progress that would be \nunthinkable without the team of more \nthan 29,000 people who today are our \ngreatest #OrgulloMELI (MELI Pride).
