That is why we offer them our platform to strengthen their \ndigital inclusion and fundraising capacity. It is how we can multiply opportunities and \nstrengthen the culture of digital giving in Latin America.\nThrough Mercado Libre Solidario (Mercado Libre Cares), we make our platforms \nand technological solutions available to NGOs throughout the region. We seek \nto strengthen the culture of digital donation in Latin America, help them raise and \nmanage funds, and expand the impact of their charitable initiatives.  \nMercado Libre Solidario offers NGOs the possibility to sell their products or services \n(produced by them or donated), access a platform to receive donations, and manage \nfunds for the operation of their programs. In addition, they can access tools to invest \ntheir money in Mercado Fondo to generate financial profitability, maintaining access \nto the money. In addition, we offer training on fundraising and digital mobilization.\nIn addition, given the situation of COVID-19, in Brazil we continue to accompany with \nthe following donations due to the emergency situation being experienced: donation \nof respirators to the State of Amazonas, in collaboration with the UNA+ Fund, and \ndirect donations to the Butant\u00e3 Institute, the UNA+ Fund and the NGO A\u00e7\u00e3o da \nCidadania.MERCADO LIBRE SOLIDARIO \nArgentina, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, and VenezuelaDONATE BUTTON\nArgentina, Brazil, and Mexico\nWe invested our know-how in technology to develop the Donate Button to facilitate \nfundraising for the network of more than 50 NGOs we support in Argentina, Brazil, \nand Mexico, furthering Mercado Libre Solidario\u2019s mission.\nThe Donate Button is a permanent feature that allows users with a Mercado Pago \naccount to donate to different social organizations in a few clicks, safely and \nconveniently.
