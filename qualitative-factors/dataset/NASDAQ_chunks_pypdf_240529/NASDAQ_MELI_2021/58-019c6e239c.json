We achieve this through the development of innovative and efficient solutions \nthat drive the growth of our business and reduce its environmental impact. This is \nhow we are leading the transition of e-commerce to a low-carbon economy.\nThe need to reduce our environmental impact involves the entire trade and logistics \nsector. Sustainable development requires us to address challenges such as the \nreconversion of the energy matrix and the adoption of transportation alternatives \nwith reduced emissions. And we know that we cannot achieve this alone. It requires \ncoordination between governments, companies, academics, and other strategic \nstakeholders. As key actors in the economic transformation of the region, we accept \nthe challenge of leading and driving this conversation. \nWe know that, as we keep on growing, we have to improve our business strategies, \nmitigating their impact throughout the value chain. That is why we work with suppliers \nand strategic partners on an environmental strategy for continuous improvement \nsupporting business growth.\nOUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STRATEGY\nEnergy efficiency \nand migration of \nour operations to \nrenewable energies.ENERGY\nCARBON FOOTPRINT MANAGEMENTRegeneration and \nconservation of the \nregion\u2019s emblematic \nnatural ecosystems.REGENERATION\nReducing the impact \nof our shipments, \nincreasing our electric \nfleet, and promoting \nthe adoption of \ninnovative solutions \nthroughout the \nvalue chain.MOBILITY\nRecyclable, reusable, \nor compostable \npackaging and \noptimization of \nthe sustainable \nmanagement of work \nmaterials, waste, and \nremnants.PACKAGING \n& MATERIALSENVIRONMENT\nWE ASSESS CLIMATE-CHANGE RISK\nIncreasingly, financial markets need \nclear, comprehensive, and quality \ninformation on the impacts of climate \nchange on organizations\u2019 operations. \nThis includes the risks and opportunities \npresented by rising temperatures, \nclimate-related policy, \nand emerging technologies. \nThat is why, in this period, we \npresented our first Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures Report, following \nthe guidelines of the Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD). In this document, we account \nfor climate change risks at all levels of \nour operations, in particular, facilities \n(distribution centers and offices), assets, \ntransportation, energy, \nand materials management. We identify risks and opportunities \nbased on the categorization \nprovided by the TCFD. There are \nphysical risks, associated with \nextreme weather events or changing \nweather or climate patterns; and \ntransition risks, classified as policy \nand legal, technology, market, and \nreputation risks.\nThe spirit of the TCFD Report is \nto promote safe and informed \ninvestment and credit decisions and \nto incorporate climate-related risks \nand opportunities into organizations\u2019 \nrisk management and strategic \nplanning processes to create \nsustainable and resilient \nbusiness models.\nTCFD Report ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2021.pdf", "page": 58, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
