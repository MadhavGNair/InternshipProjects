W e monitor and measure water \nconsumption; however, we do not have additional identifiers of water-related impacts.\nMercado Libre does not have productive processes that involve the use of water.\nMercado Libre does not have productive processes that involve water discharge.\nMercado Libre does not have processes by which emissions of this type of substances\nMercado Libre does not have processes by which emissions of this type of gases are generated.\nDuring the period of this report, we evaluated the impacts of the new suppliers that we added through the Sustainable Purchasing P olicy, in which we contemplate environmental \nimpact criteria such as the consumption of renewable energy or the responsible management of waste.GRI 305 Emission 2016 \n \nGreenhouse gas emissions in tn co2e\nGlobal Estimation\nScope 1\nScope  2\nScope  3Adjusted 2020\n527.825\n105.634\n6.092\n416.097Reported in 2020\n792.075 \n188.745 \n12.610 \n590.7202021\n1.293.925\n343.554\n11.510\n938.861Reported in 2019\n171.845 \n2967 \n9558 \n159.320\nGRI 306 Waste 2020 \nOrigin of generated waste (in tons)\nAluminum\nCardboard\nPaper\nPlastic\nWood\nOrganic/ compostable\nGeneral\nTotalARGENTINA\n0\n1173\n0\n91\n0\n0\n279\n1543BRAZIL\n0\n6309\n22\n921\n1684\n0\n1130\n10066MEXICO\n21\n3694\n28\n409\n1743\n114\n400\n6409URUGUAY\n0\n0,127\n0,003\n0,036\n0\n1,46\n1\n2,626CHILE\n0\n237\n0\n1\n2\n0\n95\n335COLOMBIA\n0\n86\n0,137\n7\n1,8\n0\n10\n105\nNon-hazardous waste by disposal method (in tons)\nReuse\nRecycling\nComposting\nRecovery\nIncineration\nInjection in deep wells\nLandfill\nOn-site Storage2020\n1861,3 \n6075,6 \n171,6 \n71,7\n0\n0\n1204,1\n02021\n3431\n12392,5\n129,9\n250,7\n0\n0\n1524\n0\nHazardous waste (in tons)\nFinal disposition2020\n4,62021\n53\nGRI 308 Supplier \nenvironmental assessment \n2016 \nGRI, SASB & IR STANDARDS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MELI_2021.pdf", "page": 73, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
