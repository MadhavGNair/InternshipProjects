People \nworking at Mercado Libre must sign it \nupon joining the company and suppliers \nand business partners must accept it \nupon joining our supply chain. In 2021, the Code was accepted by \n6,670 suppliers.\nTo ensure that all our teams understand \nand interpret the Code correctly, we \nlaunched a mandatory online training \nprogram in July. In 2021, 50% of our \nteam completed the training.\nWe efficiently and transparently \nevaluate aspects of ethical conduct \nand integrity. \nWe have procedures in place to review \ncompliance with the policies and \nprovisions contained in our Code of \nEthics. When situations of significant \nnon-compliance are detected, they are \nreported to the Ethics Committee.CORRUPTION PREVENTION\nWe comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and all anti-\ncorruption laws in the countries where we operate. Our main anti-corruption \nguidelines are described in section 14 of our Code of Ethics. \nTo ensure compliance with our standards of ethics and conduct in our value \nchain, in addition to adherence to our Code of Ethics, we include anti-corruption \nclauses in contracts with our most ethically risky suppliers. Through these clauses, \nsuppliers commit to comply with our policies and applicable laws.\n                                \nOur training on corruption prevention practices is provided to a target audience \nselected based on a risk analysis of sensitive positions within Mercado Libre. In \naddition, we have an anti-corruption module in the Code of Ethics online \ntraining course.                        \nThe Risk & Compliance team manages corruption risk, among others. Process \nreviews include the evaluation of all company operations with a risk-based \napproach.
