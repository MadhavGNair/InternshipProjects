This increase \nwas largely due to an increase in voluntary \nturnover, which comprises 60% of total turnover. \nInvoluntary turnover represents 34% of total \nturnover, down from 54% due to less \nreorganization throughout the group in 2004. \nTurnover due to natural causes remained stable  \nat 6%. \n4.1.2 Employee and management \ndevelopment \nAEGON\u2019s spending on training increased by almost \n34% from EUR 10.9 million to EUR 15.0 million, \ndespite the decrease of th e dollar against the euro. \nPer employee, the spending on training went up from EUR 440 in 2003 to EUR 574 in 2004.  \nThe average days of training per employees rose \nslightly from 3.9 to 4.0 days per year.  \nDeveloping AEGON\u2019s workforce is key to running \nthe business, especially since financial markets and \nregulations develop constantly. A structured \nappraisal process is central to this objective.  \n77% of senior manage ment, 91% of AEGON \nmiddle management and 96% of the rest of the workforce are subject to a standardized process. \nAppraisal for senior management follows a less standardized process since these functions are \nmore specific and a more personalized appraisal \nprocess is often better able to capture these \ndifferences. Appraisal processes differ by country \nunits and even within large country units. Methods \nthat are used include, but are not limited to \nManagement by Objectives, 360 Reviews or other \nmultidimensional performance appraisals and in a \nvery limited number of cases Comparative Ranking of employees. \nAEGON Corporate Responsibility Report 2004 8 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2004.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
