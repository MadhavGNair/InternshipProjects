This is especially important in light of Egypt\u2019s ongoing political challenges. \nIn 2012, we saw a signi\ufb01cant positive change in our \ncommunity relations, due in large part to numerous face-to-face meetings with stakeholders to address local issues such as environmental and water concerns. Following a collaborative stakeholder engagement process, the EMethanex team also invested in several important community projects. \nCreating a nurturing learning environment for \nyoung childrenWorking with the local Community Development Association, EMethanex provided funding for the construction of a new kindergarten and daycare centre. The centre is an important addition to the community, providing a safe and healthy learning space for 160 children aged three to six. Four new classrooms and an administration of\ufb01ce were built and equipped with new desks and chairs, computers and educational resources. A new outer fence and refurbished playground added the \ufb01nishing touches to the construction project, ensuring that the young children can play safely outdoors.\nThe kindergarten welcomed its \ufb01rst group of \nyoungsters in early 2013.\nProviding economic opportunities \nThe Orphans Sponsorship Association in Damietta organizes a sewing training workshop for local widows and orphans, providing an important income-generating opportunity that helps to support their families.\nEMethanex\u2019s investment facilitated the purchase of \nadditional knitting and sewing machines, upgrades to the workshop space and training for 20 new participants.
