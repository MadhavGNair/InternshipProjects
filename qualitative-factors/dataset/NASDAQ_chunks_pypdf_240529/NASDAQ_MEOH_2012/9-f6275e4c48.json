{"page_content": "As part of our commitment to Responsible Care and Social \nResponsibility, we have been reporting annually to the public about our global activities in these areas since 1997. \nThe 2012 Responsible Care and Social Responsibility \nReport covers the period of January 1 to December 31, 2012, and focuses on our performance and impact in four key areas: workplace, environment, community and marketplace.\nWe report on assets over which Methanex has \ndirect or part ownership and full operational control. In the case of our wholly owned subsidiary Waterfront Shipping (Waterfront), our reporting boundary includes time or spot chartered-in vessels to the extent that Waterfront has commercial control through charter party contracts. Our reporting approach includes qualitative examples that highlight our activities in speci\ufb01  c performance areas as well as quantitative measures called key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs measure the effectiveness of our policies, procedures and systems. They also recognize trends and help us identify issues that require further action.\nFor detailed information about Methanex\u2019s \n\ufb01  nancial performance, please see our 2012 Annual Report.
