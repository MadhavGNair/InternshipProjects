A highlight from the symposium was a presentation from Fiat-Chrysler, which has advocated the use of methanol as a vehicle fuel and is producing cars specifically for methanol blends in Israel. \nAnother highlight at the symposium was \nthe launch of Geely\u2019s CRI M100 flex-fuel vehicle demonstration in Iceland. This is the first of Geely\u2019s 100% methanol vehicles to be used outside of China, and also marks the first use of cars running solely on renewable methanol. RENEWABLE METHANOL\nAs a key shareholder and partner with Carbon Recycling \nInternational (CRI) in their work with renewable methanol, we supported their continued development of health, safety, and environmental practices.\nAs interest in renewable methanol projects grows, we believe it is important that \nrobust management systems and practices are in place for safe production, handling, and use of methanol in new markets. This becomes even more crucial as CRI expands its technology with other renewable methanol projects, including those in China and Europe (see www.carbonrecycling.is).  \n\u2022 Geely , a large vehicle manufacturer in China, announced a strategic investment \nin CRI last year, and launched a 12-month pilot program in Iceland with seven \n100% methanol flex-fuel vehicles powered by Vulcanol, CRI\u2019s renewable methanol product.\n\u2022\n In Eur\nope, a four-year project involving 11 companies from six countries will \nutilize surplus gases from steel production to produce methanol, planned for use as a fuel on the Stena Germanica ferry.\n\u2022\n In c\nollaboration with industrial partners in Europe, CRI is implementing its \nemissions-to-liquids (ETL) technology in an innovative renewable-fuel pilot plant, which will recycle captured CO\n2 from the emissions of a coal-fired \npower\n \nplant.\nFirst cars to run on renewable methanol in Iceland", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2016.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
