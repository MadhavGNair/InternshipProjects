However, the country has no national screening programs for bladder or bowel\n \ncancer. \nThat\u2019s why health professionals at Methanex\u2019s New Zealand plant decided to offer free bladder and bowel screening programs, along with educational and awareness programs, to employees. As a result, 82% of the site\u2019s employees participated in the bladder screening and 32% in the bowel screening, for a total of 280 screenings. Fifteen people then received follow-up appointments.\nAt Methanex, we take employee health and \nwellness very seriously. We\u2019re proud of our health professionals in each region for their work to identify and meet needs, and for their commitment to ensuring that our staff receive health care and information that can help them to live active, healthy\n \nlives.\nWorkplace HighlightsGlobal Recordable Injury Severity Rate (RISR)*\n* Recordable injury severity rate (RISR) is the ratio of significant incidents, and near-miss incidents with high potential for loss, per total \nnumber of incidents reported.\nMood buttons worn to encourage conversations about wellness \nduring Mental Health Week in Vancouver", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2016.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
