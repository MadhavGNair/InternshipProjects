For almost \n10 years, we\u2019ve been working with Akamai to expand their leadership \nrole in the industry and find new ways to reuse, remarket, and recycle \nassets that have reached end-of-use. It is an exciting opportunity to \nassist a future-focused organization like Akamai in maximizing an \nasset\u2019s potential through redeployment strategies rather than adding \nto the global e-waste problem.\u201d\nAnne McKivergan , Vice President of Compliance and QC, NCS Global Services, LLC\n\u201c", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2019.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
