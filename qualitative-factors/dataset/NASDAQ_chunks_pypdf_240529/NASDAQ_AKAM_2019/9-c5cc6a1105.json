{"page_content": "2019 Akamai Sustainability Report   9In addition to strategically reducing greenhouse gas globally, in  \n2017, we embarked on an innovative journey to develop two Akamai \nowned and operated data centers in key metros on the east coast of \nthe United States to lower our power usage effectiveness (PUE)  Both \nof these facilities were developed to consume outside air as their \nprimary source of cooling (even during the warmest months of the \nyear), which lowers the overall environmental impact of our North \nAmerica operations  \nFurthermore, by taking advantage of the operational heat tolerances \nof the hardware, we can operate our facilities at warmer temperatures \nthan you would normally see in a traditional data center   This helps  \nus lower our overall energy intensity through the development of \ninnovative cooling and ventilation systems  This effort has contributed \nto a more efficient physical footprint while helping to reduce our \ngreenhouse gas output \n50.00%\n49.86%\n30.14% 29.73%\n23.43%\n22.16%21.20%40.00%\n30.00%\n20.00%\n10.00%\n0.00%\nEurope North America Oceania Hong Kong Japan AsiaGHG Offset PercentageAt our Northern Virginia  \nfacility, we continue to see  \na PUE OF 1.09\u20131.15 \nover the past 12 months  \nof monitoringAkamai\u2019s Top 6 Focus Geographies for CO2e Mitigation", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2019.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
