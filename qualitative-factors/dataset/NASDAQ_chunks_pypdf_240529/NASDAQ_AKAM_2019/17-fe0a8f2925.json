{"page_content": "2019 Akamai Sustainability Report   17Scope 2 Renewable Energy Methodology\nAkamai tracks and monitors green power \ngeneration from renewable energy purchases at \nScope 2 facilities as a part of our overall Scope 2 \nGHG footprint  The category of contractual \ninstruments when calculating the market-based \nmethod will take into account the following areas:\n\u2022 Energy attribute certificates (GOs, RECs)\n\u2022 Direct contracts such as power purchase \nagreements (PPAs and VPPAs), where other \ninstruments or energy attribute certificates do \nnot exist\n\u2022 Pass-through from vendors through letters of \nattestation to Akamai\n\u2022 Supplier-specific emission rates\n\u2022 Residual mix (e g , the emissions rate left after \nthe three other contractual information items \nare removed from the system)\nIn an effort to limit our impact on the environment, in \n2018, Akamai participated in creating the Future of \nInternet Power (FoIP) document titled Documentation \nRequirements for Supplier-Procured Renewable \nEnergy , a collaborative initiative composed of  \nusers and providers of colo data center services  \nThe document provided the groundwork  \nfor innovative pass-through renewable energy \nreportable as Scope 2 emissions in facilities that  \nare operated by providers of colo space  The \nprocurement of renewable energy by our colo \nproviders can now have a direct impact on Scope 2 \nemissions on how much of the footprint is renewable \nwithout additional renewable energy procurement \nScope 3\nScope 3 covers remaining areas of indirect emissions \ncoming from business operations  As an example, \nthis would include the emissions coming from \ncreation of our designed hardware, electricity usage \ncoming from Akamai Accelerated Network Partners \n(AANP), corporate travel, and waste disposal  Scope \n3 generally focuses on the remaining operations coming from up the value chain, and also has a focus \non upstream and downstream activities  Upstream \nincludes all of the emission factors that occur when a \nproduct is sold by the producer   Downstream occurs \nonce the product is sold, and includes storage and \nend-of-life activities such as shipping and recycling \nScope 3 Focus Areas\nWhen considering the reporting areas that fall into \nScope 3, focused mainly on our wider footprint and \nupstream indirect emissions, Akamai will report in \nthe following areas:\n\u2022 Partners\u2019 deployments, switch, router, and \nnetwork component electricity (including \nnondirect impact, AANP , free space, and  \npower deployments)\n\u2022 Emissions to manufacturing network hardware\n\u2022 Emissions related to transporting hardware\n\u2022 Emissions related to storing hardware \n\u2022 Recycling of network hardware (logistics, \nstorage, disposal)\n\u2022 Employee air travel for business\n\u2022 Private jet / CEO air travel for business\nA2 | Method of Calculation\nAkamai follows the GHG Protocol Corporate \nAccounting and Reporting Standard  developed  \nby the World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment  (WBCSD) and World Resources \nInstitute  (WRI)  We believe using this standard will \nensure that our company is meeting all of the criteria \nrequired to report to our external sources with  \nthe highest levels of integrity, transparency, and \naccuracy   In addition to the outlined standard  \nabove, Akamai will augment the reporting and GHG \naccounting process with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 \nGuidance Document  and Technical Guidance for \nCalculating Scope 3 Emissions  to ensure continuity \nand accuracy across the reporting process ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2019.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
