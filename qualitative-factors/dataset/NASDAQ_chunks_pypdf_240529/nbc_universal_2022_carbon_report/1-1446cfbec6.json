Per the GHG Protocol, Operational Control over an operation exists where a company has full authority to introduce and implement operating policies at the operation. Included within this scope are consolidated joint ventures where we have operational control. During 2021, greenhouse gas emissions, tCO2e, decreased by 19% primarily as a result of our increased use of renewable energy, a reduction in global electricity grid emissions, and our continued effort to reduce energy usage.\n0GHG Emissions, tCO2e2,511,4752,222,5931,799,039\n2021202020192,500,0002,000,0001,500,0001,000,000500,0001,279,7511,675,509547,0841,835,053676,422Scope 1Scope 2 (market-based)519,288\n2", "metadata": {"source": "nbc_universal_2022_carbon_report.pdf", "page": 1, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
