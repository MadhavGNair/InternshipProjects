{"page_content": "142GHG Emissions Disclosure (cont.)\n5.Related to Scope 2 GHG emissions (location -based):\n\u2022GHG emissions from the generation of electricity purchased by Tesla for site operations. \nFor sites that include Superchargers (electric vehicle fast charging stations), Tesla did \nnot include electricity procured for customer use through the Supercharger stations as \nthose emissions are included in Scope 3, Category 11 Use of Sold Products.\n\u2022Global electricity usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained from \nthird -party providers.  \n\u2022The WRI and WBSCD issued additional guidance for Scope 2 emissions in 2015 (in GHG \nProtocol Scope 2 Guidance, An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard), \nwhich sets forth reporting under both location- based and market -based \nmethodologies, where the prior version of the GHG Protocol only addressed a location -\nbased methodology. The location -based method applies average emission factors that \ncorrespond to the grid where the consumption occurs, whereas the market -based \nmethod applies emission factors that correspond to energy purchased through \ncontractual instruments. Where contractual instruments were not purchased, the \nmarket -based emission factors represent either the residual mix, where available, or the \nlocation grid -average factors. This management assertion only includes Tesla\u2019s location -\nbased Scope 2 GHG emissions as Tesla is continuing to implement its processes to measure and report its market -based Scope 2 GHG emissions.\n\u2022Emission factors:\n\u2022Canada: Environment Canada. 2019 National inventory report: greenhouse gas sources and sinks in Canada.\n\u2022United Kingdom (UK): UK database published by the Department for Environment \nFood & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2022. \n\u2022U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022. \n\u2022All other countries: International Energy Agency (IEA) Emissions Factors 2021.Management Assertion\nScope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions\n\u2022Estimated emissions from the source above account for  approximately 5% of Scope 2 \nGHG emissions.\n\u2022Excluded Scope 2 GHG Emissions: Tesla excluded the following sources of GHG emissions which are estimated to represent less than 5 percent of Tesla\u2019s reported \nScope 2 GHG emissions: \n\u2022District heating and cooling.
