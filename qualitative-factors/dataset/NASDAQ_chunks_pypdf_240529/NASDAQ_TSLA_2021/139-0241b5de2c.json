{"page_content": "140GHG Emissions Disclosure (cont.)\n3.Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions are inclusive of carbon dioxide (CO2), \nnitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and industrial gases such as hydrofluorocarbons \n(HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).  Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride \n(NF3) are not emitted by Tesla\u2019s sites. These carbon dioxide equivalent emissions utilize \nGlobal Warming Potentials (GWPs) defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange\u2019s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 \u2013 100 year) unless a different \nAssessment Report is already embedded in the emission factor source. Carbon dioxide \nequivalent emissions are calculated by multiplying actual or estimated energy and fuel \nusage by the relevant emission factor taking into account the equivalent GWP. All \nemission factors are updated annually where applicable.
