{"page_content": "141GHG Emissions Disclosure (cont.)\n4.Related to Scope 1 GHG emissions: \n\u2022Stationary combustion (natural gas): \n\u2022Combustion from stationary equipment and machinery at all Tesla sites. \n\u2022Global natural gas usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained \nfrom third -party providers. \n\u2022If monthly usage data was not available, Tesla estimated the natural gas usage by \ndetermining an annual natural gas usage rate per square foot based on actual 2021 \nmonthly natural gas usage data for sites in a similar geographic location and type \nof site. This rate was then multiplied by the square footage of the site building \nspace.\n\u2022Emission factors: United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nEmission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022.\n\u2022Stationary and mobile combustion (propane, diesel, and gasoline): \n\u2022Combustion from emergency and portable generators, powered industrial vehicles \n(e.g., forklifts), temporary space heaters, and other portable equipment (e.g., \nlandscaping equipment) at manufacturing sites. \n\u2022Propane, diesel, and gasoline usage data was collected from invoices and fuel \nreports obtained from third -party providers.  \n\u2022Emission factors: U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022.\n\u2022Fleet mobile combustion (diesel and gasoline): \n\u2022Combustion from the operation of Tesla\u2019s on -road and non- road vehicles (i.e., \nTesla\u2019s global fleet).\n\u2022Diesel and gasoline usage (volume) from Tesla\u2019s global fleet was collected from fuel cards issued by Tesla\u2019s fleet management partner. Vehicle miles driven by Tesla \non-road vehicles was collected from odometer readings and driver logs. Management Assertion\nScope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions\n\u2022Tesla classified vehicles in its global fleet by type: diesel medium and heavy -duty vehicles, \ndiesel light -duty trucks, gasoline passenger cars, gasoline light -duty trucks, gasoline heavy -\nduty vehicles, and non- road industrial/commercial equipment. Temporary fleet additions for \noperational use were categorized as \u2018other\u2019, for which only CO2emissions are calculated, \nbecause Tesla does not have detailed information on what type of vehicles were rented and \nmiles driven.\n\u2022CO2emissions were calculated by multiplying the relevant emission factor by the volume of \ndiesel and gasoline used by Tesla\u2019s on -road and non- road vehicles for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021. \n\u2022CH4and N2O emissions were calculated by multiplying the relevant emission factor \n(depending on vehicle type and age) by the miles driven by Tesla\u2019s on -road vehicles, and by \nthe volume of diesel and gasoline used by Tesla\u2019s non -road vehicles, for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021. \n\u2022Emission factors: U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022. \n\u2022Process emissions (Gigafactory Nevada lithium -ion battery cell recycling plant): \n\u2022Emissions from processing manufacturing scrap lithium -ion cells at the Gigafactory Nevada \ncell recycling plant.  \n\u2022The quantity of manufacturing scrap processed was collected from Tesla\u2019s cell recycling plant \noperations team. The concentration of CO2and CH4in emissions (emission rates) were \nmeasured during two emissions source tests. GHG emissions were calculated by multiplying \nthe quantity of manufacturing scrap processed, as recorded by the recycling plant operations \nteam, by the CO2and CH4emission rates developed based on emissions source tests. \n\u2022Estimated emissions from the sources above account for approximately 10% of Scope 1 GHG \nemissions.\n\u2022Excluded Scope 1 GHG emissions: Tesla excluded the following sources of GHG emissions which \nare estimated to represent less than 5 percent of Tesla\u2019s reported Scope 1 GHG emissions:\n\u2022GHG emissions resulting from propane, diesel, and gasoline combustion at Tesla sites not engaged in manufacturing.\n\u2022GHG emissions from refrigerant loss to the atmosphere.\n\u2022GHG emissions from emergency stabilization of damaged and potentially damaged lithium -\nion cells.\n\u2022GHG emissions resulting from the chemical reaction of two -part polyurethane adhesives", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TSLA_2021.pdf", "page": 140, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
