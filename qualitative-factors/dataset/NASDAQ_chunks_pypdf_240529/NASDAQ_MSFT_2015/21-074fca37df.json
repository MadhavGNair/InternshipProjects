The reductions were spread across \nmany different business units and many different \ncountries. We sought to go through this process \nwith the deepest respect for affected individuals \nand recognition of their service to the company. \nWe offered severance to all employees, as well \nas job transition help in many locations. Around \nthe world, we worked to ensure we followed local \nprocess and laws in each of the countries affected.
