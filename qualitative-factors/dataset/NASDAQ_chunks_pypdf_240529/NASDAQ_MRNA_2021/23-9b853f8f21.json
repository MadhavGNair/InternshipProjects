We are making progress on key \nenvironmental sustainability initiatives, including: \n\tzEstablish baseline metrics including Energy, \nWaste and Water to inform the creation \nand implementation of a comprehensive \nenvironmental sustainability program, which is \none of the five key areas of our CSR program.\n\tzDevelop a comprehensive renewable energy \nstrategy.\n\tzOur Cambridge headquarters is located in a \nGold LEED-certified building, and the Moderna \nTechnology Center, located in Norwood, \nMassachusetts, was designed to incorporate \nmany LEED energy efficient design elements \nwhen it was first opened in 2018, and it will \ncontinue to do so as we expand.\tzInvest in the new Moderna Science \nCenter at 325\u00a0Binney\u00a0Street in Cambridge, \nMassachusetts, to create a purpose-built \nspace to support our next chapter of discovery \nand serve as our principal executive offices. \nThe high-performance building is targeting \nLEED Platinum Core & Shell and LEED Zero \nEnergy certifications. The building will include \nultra-efficient building systems with acoustical \nand light pollution mitigation measures.\n\tzIncorporate sustainable design and construction \nelements into all new projects, starting with our \nnew manufacturing plants in Canada, Australia, \nand in Kenya, including access to renewable \nenergy sources and LEED Certifications as part \nof site selection criteria.\n\tzContinue to encourage green transportation \namong our employees by offering fully \nsubsidized public transport, bike sharing and \nfree electric vehicle charging stations across all \ncampuses.\n\tzWork with each of our suppliers to ensure that \nthey also move to net-zero carbon and partner \nacross industries to seek innovative solutions and \nachieve net-zero targets. \u201cThe journey ahead to achieve net zero \ncarbon emissions in our global operations in \n2030 is a challenge in line with our mindsets \nat Moderna to act with urgency and push \npast possible. With our engineering and \nmanufacturing teams, we are designing \nour roadmap to embed sustainability by \ndesign in our current facilities and future \nmanufacturing sites. The advantage of \nour mRNA platform is that we can apply \nsustainability design learnings across sites\u201d\nDeborah Donovan, \nSenior Vice President Environment, Health and Safety \nmoderna    2021 ESG Report \n24Message from our CEO Table of contents Moderna in 2021 Areas of focus Medicines for patients Employees Community Governance and ethics Going forward Appendix\n Environment", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MRNA_2021.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
