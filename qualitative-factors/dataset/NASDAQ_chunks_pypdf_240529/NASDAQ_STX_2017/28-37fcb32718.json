Our manufacturing processes draw  water from local watersheds for use as coolants and cleaning \nagents. We have applied  measures to reduce wat er consumption, improve water recycling, increase \nawareness among employee, and reduce water intensit y over the past several years. Like our carbon \nemissions, total annual water metrics are repo rted based on the calendar year, not the fiscal year.  \n  \nIn CY 2016 we reduced total water withdrawn by 15 \npercent, from 11,927 megaliters in CY2015 to 10,119 \nmegaliters  in CY2017 . This is total volume of water \nwithdrawn from municipal water supplies based on meter \nreading. In CY2016 we recycled 1,873 megaliters of \nwater, down from 1,970 megaliters in CY2015, a 5 \npercent decrease based on meter reading. Our progress \nhas been driven by re ducing water  use through more \nefficient processes, and recycling the water we use. In \nCY2016 our water intensity was 40 liters per EB,  down \nfrom 54 liters per EB in CY2015 , a 25 percent decrease. \nThis is due to both a 15 percent reduction in withdrawal \nas well as the increased number of EB shipped in \nCY2016 from CY2015.  \n \nWe also conducted a river basin -level water risk assessment in FY2017, covering all manufacturing and large \nR&D facilities, using the WRI Aqueduct tool to best understand water -related risk factors.  Continuing to \nimprove our overall water recycling and remains one of our biggest opportunities. In CY2012, Seagate \nestab lished a 5 -year water use -reduction goal of 10 percent. To support this goal, we conducted our first full \nwater consumption footprint to create a baseline for the company in CY2012. This improved on previous water \nwithdrawal data, which was only available for product manufacturing. We continue to use the CY2012 baseline \nfor year -over-year comparisons. In addition to this report we report our water footprint e xternally via the CDP. \nSeagate has achieved the reduction target that was set four years ago.   \n \n Recycled , \n16126 , 83%Reused , 92, \n0%Energy \nRecovery , \n171, 1%Composted , \n170, 1%Incinerated , \n824, 4%Landfill , \n2130 , 11%Solid Waste Disposition \n(tons) FY2017\nRecycled , \n7641Treatment , \n1785Energy \nRecovery , \n176Incinerated , \n610 Landfill , 0Hazardous Waste Disposition \n(tons) FY2017\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2017.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
