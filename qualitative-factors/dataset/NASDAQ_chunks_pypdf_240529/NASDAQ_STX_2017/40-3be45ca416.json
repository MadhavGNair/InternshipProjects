This pledge shows the company\u2019s \ncommitment to cultivating a trusting environment where \ndiverse experiences and perspectives are welcomed and \nwhere employees feel comfortable and empowered to \ndiscuss diversity and inclusion.  \nWe made progress me asuring and reporting workforce \ndiversity. Enhanced reporting gives us the ability to \npotentially quantify the value of diversity and inclusion. \nWe continue to provide our executives with quarterly \ndiversity scorecards to monitor and report our diversity \nstatistics. As stated in our \u201cEngagement\u201d section, our \nengagement micro survey focuses on belonging and \nresults are included biannually in our diversity \nscorecards.  \nTo create a sense of belonging, Seagate employees \nhave established \u201cCommunities of Interest\u201d. These \ninformal, voluntary groups are managed by employees \nand help foster a sense of belonging among employees \nwho share a diversity identity. These communities may \nexist at one or multiple sites. We have Communities of \nInterest at several Seaga te locations around the world, \nwhich focus on such areas as Women\u2019s Leade rship; \nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and \nIntersex (LGBTQI); and Engagement. These voluntary \ngroups, which are a resource in promoting awareness, \ninclusion , and professio nal development, are open to all \nemployees.  \nThe process of building a diverse workforce begins with \nrecruiting talented people that align with our values and \npriorities. Seagate realizes that a shortage of qualified \ntalent is making recruiting increasing ly more competitive. \nPart of our global talent acquisition strategy is to build a \npipeline of potential talent. To help do so, we \nimplemented a candidate relationship management tool \nthat can help identify and track talent for highly skilled \nroles and buil d relationships with potential candidates for \nlong-term engagement. We also hired a dedicated Talent \nBrand Strategist within our Talent Acquisition team  to \nfocus on our candidate experience across our social and \ndigital channels , including our careers website . These \nTalent Acquisition strategies and tools helped us to \nachieve a global female hire rate of 62 percent and a \nfemale hire rate of 34 percent in the U.S.  \nWe developed and rolled out a Behavioral -Based \nInterviewing toolkit for hiring managers. This toolkit \nincludes training and resources to provide a consistent, \ndefined approach to evaluate candidates and reduce \nbias in the interview process. Additionally, w e redefined \nour global onboarding experience for new hires. The \nfocus of the redesign was to simplify our structu re, content, delivery , and governance to improve the overall \nonboarding experience for new hires and hiring managers.  41.5%\n51.6%U.S. Regular Employee Hires\nMinority Non-Minority\n48.7%\n31.0% 34.6% 33.6%51.3%\n69.0% 65.4% 66.4%\n0%20%40%60%80%100%\nManagement Professionals Operators &\nSupportTotalU.S. Hires by Job Type and \nGender\nFemale Male47.0%37.8%66.2% 62.1%53.0%62.2%33.8% 37.9%\n0%20%40%60%80%100%\nManagement Professionals Operators &\nSupportTotalGlobal Hires by Job Type and \nGender\nFemale Male", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2017.pdf", "page": 40, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
