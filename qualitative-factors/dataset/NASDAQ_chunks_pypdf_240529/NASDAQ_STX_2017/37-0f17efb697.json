We conduc ted more than \n50,000 health and safety e-learning courses in FY2017. This is up 73 percent from the courses that Seagate \nemployees completed in FY2016, primarily due to a 2 -year refresher training cycle for multiple courses. We \ncontinue to emphasize e -learning courses as our main vehicle for delivering training because employees can \nlearn at their own pace.  \n  \nIn FY2017  we served more than 697,500 meals  globally per month (on average ), and have a formal food \nsafety program at all of our sites. We  also bused employees o ver 10 million miles, with just  1.6 incidents per \none million miles traveled.

Wellness includes both physical and emotional health, as well as \nfinancial wellness; a cknowledging the various individual choices and cultural variations that compose our global \nworkforce, Seagate strives to cultivate an environment of health  and wellness . One of the ways w e do this is through \nour Healthy Journeys program, which seeks to educate , encourage, and support  our employees as they work on \nachieving their health and wellness goals. Because our benefits programs are managed at a regional or site level, in \nline with l ocal legislation and employment policies, the Healthy Journeys program varies from country to country.  \n \nIn the United States  \n  \nWe promoted our Healthy Journeys program by providing on -site biometric screenings, health coaching, site -\nlevel activities, and t wo U.S. -wide wellness challenges aimed at encouraging physical activity, social \nconnectedness, and relaxation.
