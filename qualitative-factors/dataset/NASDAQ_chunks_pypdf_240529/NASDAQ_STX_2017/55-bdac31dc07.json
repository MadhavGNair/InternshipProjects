The values provided in this table are for calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  \n2 In 2015 three adjustments  were made to the 2011 \u2013 2014 inventory years. The adjustments were due to a methodology change in how Scope 2 \nemissions are reported, the identification of leased facilities not captured in previous inventories, and updated global warm ing potentials (GWPs ) in the \nIPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Seagate follows the guidelines in the GHG Protocol for adjusting the base year GHG inventory.  \n3 Includes Scope 3 emissions from business travel and employee commute only.   \n \n4 Change in system and process resulted in l ower development plan numbers in FY2016 and FY2017.  \n ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2017.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
