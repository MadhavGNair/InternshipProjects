In \n2021, we continued to reduce the size of our packaging for select Ryzen PIBs by an average of 50 \npercent compared to the previous generation.32 And by May 2021, we reduced the size of our packaging \nfor Radeon PRO (W6800) graphics cards by up to 59 percent compared to the previous generation \n(W5700).33 All our packaging  in 2021 was  made of recyclable  materials, such as paperboard. Our \npackaging  designers continuously seek out  environmentally preferable packing materials, including \nrecycled materials and non -toxic dyes.    \nLifecycle Management   \nBy engineering our products for longer life, minimizing the number of devices potentially needed in the \nfirst place  and, in some cases, making them backward compatible with our customers\u2019 existing systems, \nwe can help make better use of our planet\u2019s limited natural resources.  \nAMD EPYC processors are designed to meet application performance demands with fewer servers, \nresulting in less electricity use and GHG emissions for IT infrastructure as well as for cooling data \ncenters, while avoiding added raw materials that need to be extracted, shipped, manufactured and \ndisposed. For example,  to deliver 10,000 units of integer performance, a 2P AMD EPYC 7763 -powered \nserver takes an estimated 29  percent  fewer servers, 29  percent  less power, and has up to \n30 percent  lower 3 -year total cost of ownership (TCO) than a 2P -based Intel Xeon Platinum 8380.34 \n \n32 PIB reduction based on transitioning from Full SR1 Ryzen CUBE to \u00bd sized SR1 PIB Boxes - 134 mm (H) x 134 mm(W) x 134 \nmm(L) to 134 mm(H) x 69 mm (W) x 134 mm(L)   \n33 Calculations conducted by AMD as of May 2021 on the double slot, full height Radeon PRO W6800 and comparable previous \ngeneration Radeon PRO W5700 retail boxes.   \n34 MLNTCO -020:  This scenario contains many assumptions and estimates and, while based on AMD internal research and best \napproximations, should be considered an example for information purposes only, and not used as a basis for decision  making \nover actual test ing.
