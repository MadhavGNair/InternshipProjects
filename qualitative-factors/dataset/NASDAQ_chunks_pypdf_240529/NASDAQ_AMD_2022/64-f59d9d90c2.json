To achieve our aspirations,  we want a strong culture that reaches \nacross all aspects of our business.  \n \nOur DB&I approach includes:  \n\u2022 Listening to our employees through our annual AMDer Survey and curated groups;  \n\u2022 Deepening our relationships in the United States with Historically Blac k Colleges and Universities \n(HBCUs) and Hispanic -Serving Institutions (HSIs);  \n\u2022 Working to reduce unconscious bias in the workplace by educating our global workforce on the \npower of multiple voices in driving innovation \u2013 we educate employees on how a workpl ace of \ninclusion positively impacts the products we develop and the day -to-day experiences of our \nemployees, and we also highlight the strength of diversity in the interviewing and promotions \nprocesses;  \n\u2022 Evaluating employee compensation programs annually so  that colleagues performing similar \nwork in the same geographic area and at the same level have equitable compensation \nopportunities;  \n\u2022 Ensuring that every  AMDer  around the globe \u202fhas the opportunity to \u202famplify their unique voice \nto contribute to our company\u2019 s success; and  \n\u2022 Offering mentors within our employee resource groups to further drive a sense of community.  \n \nBy building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging and increasing the \ninclusion of under -represented groups, we w ill make AMD stronger. We will elevate our talent and \nimprove business outcomes by encouraging employees to bring their whole selves to work. Our Multi -\nVoice Initiative encourages and supports all \u202fAMDers\u202fwho champion and, when needed, challenge our \ncompany  culture with their unique perspective.  \n \nWhat  we are  doing is working. In our annual AMDer  Survey, we ask multiple questions on how our \nculture and processes support our commitment to DB&I. We invited 100 percent of our employees to  \nparticipate in our 2021 AMDer Survey,  and 96 percent responded. Their responses to those questions \nand the overal l index score are in the top 10 percent of global companies within the tech industry. In \n2021, we were recognized by the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign \nCorporate Equality Index as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality.  \n \n \n \n \n \n48 https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the -stem -gap/   ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2022.pdf", "page": 64, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
