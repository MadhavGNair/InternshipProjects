The AMD EPYC \u2122 SERVER VIRTUALIZATION and GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TCO ESTIMATION \nTOOL  tool compares the 2P AMD EPYC \u2122 and the 2P Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae server solutions required to  deliver 1200 total virtual \nmachines ( VM), requiring 1 core and 8GB of memory per VM. The analysis includes both hardware and virtualization software \ncomponents.   Hardware costs (CPU + memory + storage + chassis): The 2P AMD   64 core  EPYC_7713 processor used in this \nsolution analysis provides 128 total cores per server, each processor cost  $7060 and the server uses 32 x 32GB DIMMs to \nachieve the minimum required memory footprint, in a 1RU server chassis that cost  $2200, and requires 1 server racks. The AMD \nsolution has a total estimated hardwar e acquisition cost of $217880.   The 40 core Intel Xeon Platinum_8380 processor used in \nthis solution analysis provides 80 total cores per server.   Each  processor cost $8666 and the server uses 16 x 64GB DIMMs to \nachieve the minimum required memory footprin t, in a 2RU server chassis that cost $2500 and requires 2 server racks. The Intel \nsolution has a total estimated hardware acquisition  cost of $390060.    \n \nOPERATING COSTS:  The core assumptions for this analysis are as follows: Cost of power @ $0.12 with   kwatts  (kW) of power to \neach rack and a PUE (power usage effectiveness) of 1.7 and a server rack size of 42RU.   Each server has 1  hard drives drawing 3 \nwatt s each. Server Admin annual salary is $85000 managing 30 physical servers with a salary burden rate of 30 percent.   The \nVM Admin salary is $85000, with a burden rate of 30percent and managing 400 VMs.  \n \nAMD has estimated  OpEx  costs as follows: a hardware a dmin cost of $110500, a real estate cost of $19440, and a power cost of \n$40208.4, for a total estimated  3 year  TCO cost (hardware cost and operating expense) of $388028 with \nAMD.  Estimated  OpEx  costs for Intel  are: hardware admin cost of $165750, real esta te cost of $38880, and power cost of \n$58704.  \n \nHARDWARE TCO: This is the  CapEx  and OpEx  directly associated with the hardware. The AMD EPYC_7713 solution requires 10 - \n2P servers with a  CapEx  of $217880 with a total estimated  3-year  TCO cost (CapEx  plus OpEx) of $388028.  The Intel \nPlatinum_8380 processor requires 15 - 2P servers with a  CapEx  of $390060 with a total estimated  3-year  TCO cost \n(CapEx  plus OpEx) of $653394. The AMD solution  has an estimated 41 percent lower hardware TCO for this \nvirtualization  solution, 1 - ($388028 \u00f7 $653394) = 41 percent,  than  the Intel solution.  \n \nVIRTUALIZATION TCO:   Analysis is based on the following estimates:  3 year  Virtualization (hardware, operating, and software \n ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2022.pdf", "page": 41, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
