We actively engage in key efforts by \nparticipating in open, transparent proceedings that may involve decision makers, industry peers, \ncustomers, suppliers or civil society organizations. We strive to understand the issues, listen to different \nperspectives and share our experiences to promote effective solutions.

We meet \nannually to share our progress against goals \nand to gain a deeper understanding of how we \ncan improve our corporate responsibility strategy, initiatives and performance. In previous years, we  \nhave worked with Ceres to convene groups of external subject matter experts to have frank \nconversations with AMD decision makers about the opportunities and risks presented in topics such as \nartificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies, human rights and labor and product energy \nefficiency.

In 2021, Ceres worked with the AMD Co rporate Responsibility team and \ninterviewed several senior executives to review the results of the materiality assessment and discuss \nhow the findings inform AMD ESG focus areas moving forward.
