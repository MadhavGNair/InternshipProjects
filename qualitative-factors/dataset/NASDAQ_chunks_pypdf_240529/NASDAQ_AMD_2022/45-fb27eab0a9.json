{"page_content": "46 \n \n [Public]  \nIn many cases, AMD powered se rver and desktop CPU sockets are backwards compatible with the \nprevious generation processor, meaning the CPU can be upgraded using the existing motherboard. As a \nresult, processing power can be increased without the cost or environmental impact of replaci ng other \ncomponents like memory and hard drive. In 2021, the AMD IT department upgraded AMD 2nd \ngeneration EPYC processors with AMD 3rd generation EPYC processors to benefit from the increase in \nperformance without increasing power consumption.  \n \nINNOVATIN G ON COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS  \nAMD collaborates with enterprises, governments, researchers and others to help them put our \ntechnology to work solving some of the world\u2019s most pressing environmental challenges.  \n \n \n \nreal estate cost is ~$58320 using 3 racks. The total 3 TCO estimate for the Intel solution is  $751495.048.   \nAMD EPYC powered servers have a $228490 lower 3 -year TCO.  \n \nDelivering 10000   estimated score of SPECrate\u00ae2017_int_base performance produces the following estimated results: the AMD \nEPYC solution requires 29 percent fewer server s [1-(AMD server count / Intel server count)]; 33 percent less space [1 -(AMD  rack \ncount / Intel rack count)]; 29 percent less power [1 -(AMD power cost / Intel power cost)];   providing a 30 percent lower 3 -year \nTCO [1 -(AMD TCO / Intel TCO)].   delivering ~98  or ~1 percent Better w/ AMD SPECrate\u00ae2017_int_base solution score   \n \nAMD EPYC_7763 powered servers save ~227276.4kWh of electricity for the 3 years of this analysis. Leveraging this data, using \nthe Country / Region specific electricity factors from the '2 020 Grid Electricity Emissions Factors v1.4 \u2013 September  2020', and \nthe United States Environmental Protection Agency   'Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator', the AMD EPYC powered server \nsaves ~103.01 Metric Tons of CO2 equivalents. This results in the f ollowing estimated savings based  on United States data,   \n \nEmissions Avoided equivalent to one of the following:  \n     22 USA Passenger Cars Not Driven for 1 year; or  \n     7.45 USA Passenger Cars Not Driven Annually; or  \n     11640 Gallons of Gasoline Not Used; or  \nCarbon Sequestered equivalent to:  \n     1700 Tree Seedlings Grown for 10 years in USA; or   \n     41.2 Acres of USA Forests Annually.  \n \nThe 2020 Grid Electricity Emissions Factors v1.4 \u2013 September 2020 data used in this analysis can be found at \nhttps://www.carbonfootprint.com/docs/2020_09_emissions_factors_sources_for_2020_electricity_v14.pdf and   \nthe US EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator used in this analysis can be found \nathttps://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse -gas-equivale ncies -calculator  \n \nAMD processor pricing based on 1KU price as of Sept 2021.
