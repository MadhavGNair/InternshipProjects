Our approach exte nds \nfrom how our products are designed, manufactured and packaged to how they are assembled, shipped \nand used.  \nEmbedding Corporate Responsibility Across Our Value Chain  \n \nWe have mapped our corporate responsibility programs and initiatives to the primary activities of our \nvalue chain.  \n \nDESIGNING  \nAMD engineers design the circuitry for microprocessors, graphics, embedded devices and accelerated \nprocessing units.

A typical wafer is made from pure silico n that is \nformed into cylindrical ingots. These ingots are then sliced into wafers about 0.75 mm thick. Each wafer \nundergoes multiple steps in the fabrication process to produce an AMD -designed processor or \u201cdie.\u201d \nThe working die from the silicon wafer is cut and sent to be assembled into a chip.  \n\u2022 Supply Chain Responsibility  \n\u2022 Responsible Minerals  Sourcing   \n \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2022.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
