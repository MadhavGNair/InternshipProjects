As warrante d, suppliers are required to create a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) and submit it to \nAMD  per the deadlines and requirements informed by the RBA VAP Protocol, including onsite third -\nparty closure audits.  When priority nonconformances are found, AMD contacts the supplier and \nrequests details on the actions the site is implementing to immediately address the nonconformance \n(NC) prior to creating the longer -term CAP. Depending on the severity of the issue, discussions may be \nelevated for a more in -depth conversa tion between company executives. Regardless, if a supplier is not \nfollowing the RBA CAP closure timeline, AMD executives will be informed for appropriate action.    \nAccountability  \n  \nWe use supplier scorecards to hold suppliers accountable for their perform ance against AMD supply \nchain responsibility expectations.
