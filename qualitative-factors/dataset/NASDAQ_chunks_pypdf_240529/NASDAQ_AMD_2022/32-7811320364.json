Purdue University wanted to create a \n\u201cscience as a service\u201d system with forward -looking mixed (cloud) computing and c omposable \ncapabilities that could deliver the maximum amount of research computing capacity to the U.S. \nacademic community. With the help of Dell EMC PowerEdge servers powered by AMD EPYC processors, \nPurdue won a $10 million National Science Foundation (NS F) grant to provide the Extreme Science and \nEngineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) with the Anvil supercomputer.  \nRead Case Study  \n \nVestas supercharges sustainable energy with Azure \u2122 HPC powered by AMD EPYC \u2122 processors  \nVestas Wind Systems deployed mind.ai\u2019s DeepSim reinforced learning platform, running on Microsoft \nAzure HPC powered by 3rd Generation AMD EPYC processors, to optimize wind turbine orchestration. \nThe aim was to reduce power  lost due to wake turbulence and increase the generation of renewable \nenergy and improve value. The latest AMD CPUs offered high compute power and memory bandwidth \nthat is crucial for simulations involving large amounts of weather data. Vestas expects that  this \noptimization will create significant improvements for existing wind farms, and the company wants to \nhelp customers build future wind farms with these formulas in mind.  \nRead Case Study  \nFind more case studies on science, technology and healthcare  \n  \nEnvironmental Sustainability  \n \nWhy It Matters  \n \nAccording to the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2022 Global Risks Report , \u201cclimate action failure\u201d is the \nnumber one long -term threat to the world, and it is the risk that has potentially the most severe impacts \nover the next decade.15 This is not only a future challenge \u2013 the related issues are already manifesting. \nGlobally,  the years 2013 -2021 all rank among the ten warmest years on record.16 Temperatures are \nincreasing due to human activities, specifically emissions of greenhouse gas es (GHGs), according to \nexperts.
