One particular action has had a \nvisible effect on emissions. The installation \nof increased flaring capacity resulted in \nreduced emissions through cold vent. The \neffects of this can be seen in the reduced \nemission of a number of gasses most nota-\nbly Carbon Monoxide, Nitrous Oxide and \nMethane.During 2019, work progressed on devel-\noping a broad and long-term solution for \nhandling the associated gas that is produced \ntogether with the oil. A concept has been \nselected that includes utilising some of the \ngas for power generation in the field and \nthus replacing the diesel- powered genera-\ntors. Additional gas would be exported and \nsold. The effect of the gas utilisation pro-\nject would be to significantly reduce Blocks \n3&4\u2019s atmospheric emissions as flaring \nwould be minimised, diesel consumption \nreduced and excess gas sold to be consumed elsewhere rather than burned off to no ben-\nefit. A Front-End Engineering and Design \n(FEED) study will be conducted in parallel \nwith commercial discussions between part-\nners and government authorities.\nAs part of a pilot project gas powered gen-\nerators were installed and commissioned \non the Shahd field at the end of 2019. The \npower generated will be used to power the \nproduction infrastructure as well as the \ncamps. A similar project will be conducted \non the Saiwan field during 2020.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TETY_2019.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
