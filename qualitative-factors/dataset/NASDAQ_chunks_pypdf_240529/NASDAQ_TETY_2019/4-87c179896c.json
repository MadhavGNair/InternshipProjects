The strategic deci-\nsion to focus purely on onshore explora-\ntion and production of oil is a function \nof this approach. Onshore oil exploration \ninvolves a lower financial exposure due \nto lower drilling and development cost. \nIt also involves lower environmental and \nsafety risks compared to offshore drilling, particularly in harsh environments. The \nstrategic decision to focus on geographies \nwith proven hydrocarbons allows Tethys \nOil to reduce subsurface risk by seeking \nto explore in areas with previously over-\nlooked discoveries and plays using modern \ntechniques and with proven, conventional \ntechnology.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TETY_2019.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
