As a prominent part of the worldwide travel industry, we conduct our business in a \nmanner that protects human rights and the rights of children within our sphere of influence. We have \nadopted responsible workplace practices and endeavor to conduct our business operations free from \ncomplicity in human rights abuses.\nAmerican\u2019s commitment to human rights is outlined in our Standards of Business Conduct, which require \nall of American\u2019s team members and suppliers to uphold the human rights of all persons, including \npermanent and temporary team members both domestically and internationally. American\u2019s policies and \nother information on human trafficking, including links to educational and training resources, are available \nto all team members on our intranet site.\nOn National Human Trafficking Awareness Day in January 2018, American signed ECPAT-USA\u2019s Tourism \nChild-Protection Code of Conduct, a voluntary set of business principles to prevent child sex tourism \nand trafficking of children. Signing the code formally recognized our longstanding commitment to \nhelp frontline team members identify and report signs of human trafficking, and we continue to raise \nawareness of the issue among our team.\nAmerican has provided initial and recurrent human trafficking awareness training to our flight attendants \nfor several years. American also provides anti-trafficking training to team members with relevant \npurchasing responsibilities, including training teams that conduct on-site visits to American\u2019s international \nsuppliers to learn how to recognize signs of human trafficking and what action they should take if they \nsuspect human trafficking.\nAfter announcing our intention to sign ECPAT-USA\u2019s Code, we also initiated plans to conduct similar anti-\ntrafficking training for our pilots and airport customer service team members. As a result, in 2018 we put \nmandatory human trafficking awareness training in place for all of our frontline team \u2014 approximately \n26,000 flight attendants, 1 5,000 pilots and 18,000 airport agents.Build American Airlines to Thrive Forever ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2018.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
