{"page_content": "29\n2018 Corporate Responsibility ReportINNOVATING FOR  \nTHE FUTURE\nAmerican has an ongoing \npartnership with the FAA and \nNASA to develop the future of \nairspace and optimize ramp \nand gate management for \nmaximum efficiency. \nTeam members in American\u2019s Hub Control Center at CLT are working \nwith FAA and NASA engineers to reimagine tomorrow\u2019s airspace \nand operations management. This includes the Airspace Technology \nDemonstration 2 program, a five-year project to streamline arrivals and \ndepartures and improve ground operations to increase safety  \nand efficiency. \nCurrent systems rely on radar but tracking planes on the airport surface \nremains a blind spot that can leave planes idling as they wait for an \nopen gate or in line to take off. The new system uses GPS and satellite \ntechnology to incorporate real-time data across all systems and allow \ncoordination among the ramp, air traffic control tower, terminal and \nControl Center. This information will give air traffic controllers the tools to \nmake better decisions to reduce congestion in the air and on the ground. \nPlanners can also use this data to more precisely develop schedules, \nreducing push, taxi and take-off times.\nSimultaneous advancements are being made on aircraft as well. In May \n2018, American announced that it will equip its entire Airbus A321 fleet \nwith ACSS SafeRoute Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast \n(ADS-B), a next-generation surveillance technology. ADS-B incorporates \nboth air and ground data to give air traffic controllers a more accurate \npicture of an aircraft\u2019s position from gate to gate. American\u2019s fleet of \nAirbus A330s is already equipped with ADS-B technology.\nOur goal with these complementary projects is to improve the flow of \naircraft by taking real-time snapshots of what\u2019s happening on the ground, \nallowing us to provide a better travel experience for our customers and \nimprove fuel efficiency and safety conditions on the tarmac.\nTHINKING FORWARD  \nTO NEW TECHNOLOGIES \nWe are committed to innovating \ntoward solutions that equip our team \nof 1 30,000 with the tools they need to \nmake their jobs easier and safer.
