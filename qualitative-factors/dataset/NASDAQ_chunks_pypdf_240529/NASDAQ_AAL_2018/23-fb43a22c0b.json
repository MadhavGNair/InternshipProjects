We are making historic investments in innovation, breaking ground on new \nairport modernization projects and expanding our route network and partnerships around the world. \nLooking ahead, we will finalize our integration and continue to responsibly manage our assets like owners.\nOur team members\u2019 hard work helped produce pre-tax profit of $1.9 billion, or $2.8 billion excluding net special charges, in \n20181.

We\u2019re making significant \nfinancial contributions to the more than $50 billion in airport capital improvement projects approved, funded and underway at \nour hubs. In addition, our Corporate Real Estate (CRE) and IT teams have systematically analyzed our facilities to identify spaces that \nwere long overdue for improvement. We have refurbished more than 1 , 100 team member spaces around the system, including \nindividual work areas, break rooms and reservations offices.
