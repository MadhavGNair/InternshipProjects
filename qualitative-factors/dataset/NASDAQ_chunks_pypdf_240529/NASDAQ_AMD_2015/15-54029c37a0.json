Some key performance highlights:\n1. New, ground-up, high-performance x86 core design\n2. Simultaneous Multithreading architecture (SMT) for high throughput\n3. New high-bandwidth, low latency cache system\n4. Energy-efficient FinFET design scales from client to enterprise-class products\n5. 40% boost in performance (instructions per clock) expected1 \n6. Our Zen+ product will follow-on and deliver another anticipated step-up in performance \n7. AMD\u2019s all new CPU, \u201cSummit Ridge, \u201d targeting the desktop computer market will use  \nthe same package as our \u201cBristol Ridge\u201d APU, giving us a single platform for APU and  \nCPU products. This presents a tremendous advantage for customers who may want  \nto move systems between APU and CPU with a discrete GPU.LOOKING  \nAHEAD\nAMD AND THE  \nASSOCIATED PRESS  \nCOLLABORATE TO ENABLE \nNEXT-GENERATION  \nVIRTUAL REALITY (VR)  \nJOURNALISM\nAMD collaborated with the  \nAssociated Press (AP) to form a new \nvirtual reality experience news channel \nto fuel next-generation journalism. As \npart of the collaboration between the \ncompanies, AP leverages AMD Radeon\u2122 \ngraphics technology to render lifelike VR \nenvironments built around news and \ndocumentary content, and AMD \nprovides the hardware platforms, \nsoftware technology and VR expertise \nto support AP\u2019s journalism in  \nVR and 360\u02da video.\n1 Based on internal AMD estimates for \u201cZen\u201d x86 CPU core compared to \u201cExcavator\u201d x86 CPU core", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2015.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
