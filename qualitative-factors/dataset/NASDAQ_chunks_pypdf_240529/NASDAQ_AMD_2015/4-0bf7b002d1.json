Considering the technical challenges of the future, it\u2019s an important question \u2014 one that inspired the founders of zSpace.\nA staggering number of children report being bored in the classroom, especially when it comes to science, technology, engineering, and math \u2014 the so-called STEM skills.  \nOne study found that \u201conly 16% of American high school seniors are proficient in mathematics and interested in a STEM career. \u201d1 To truly engage students requires an innovative  \napproach. The zSpace system, powered by AMD technology, allows students to not only visualize complex topics, but interact with them in real time.From analyzing the human heart to deconstructing a piece of machinery, students simply put on a pair of zSpace glasses, pick up a stylus, and start exploring. Virtual holographic  \nimages can be \u201clifted\u201d from the screen and manipulated with the stylus. According to zSpace Marketing Manager Amanda Austin, \u201czSpace changes the human/computer interface.  \nInstead of leaving everything stuck behind the screen, you get to engage with it above the screen in your world. \u201d\nMade possible by AMD FirePro\u2122 graphics cards, zSpace is a technology borne of collaboration. With the only graphics card that could support the stereo imaging needs of the zSpace  \nhardware, AMD was the obvious partner. Inspired by what zSpace was doing, AMD used the experience to improve their own products. According to Eric Tripp, Senior Quality Assurance  \nLead at zSpace, \u201c AMD said, \u2018You know, we don\u2019t really have any clients doing this the way you are \u2026 we don\u2019t have anyone raising these issues. \u2019 So because of zSpace being sort of that  guinea pig and providing all this feedback, they\u2019ve now built a world-class driver. \u201d\nThe AMD and zSpace joint effort is a testament to the power of collaboration and inspiration. Applying innovative technology to help students learn,  \nthe companies worked together to create a world-class educational solution.\nI was working with a local district when a parent came rushing in and said, \n\u201cMy son came home from school today and said, \u2018Dad, I finally get it now.  I get why people do this and I get how the heart works. \u2019\u201d\n\u2013 Elizabeth Lytle, Director of Education & Product Experience, zSpaceZSPACE AND AMD: COLLABORATING  \nTO HELP STUDENTS LEARN SCIENCE  THOUGH VIRTUAL REALITY\n1 Dr. Jackie Gerstein, Education Insider\u2122, \u201cSTEM for Elementary School Students \u2014 How to Instill a Lifelong Love of Science, \u201d It\u2019s About Time 08/13/2015INSPIRED,  \nEVERY DAY \nWe are inspired by how \ndigital technology has improved our world.  \nFrom helping students  \nlearn to innovative new therapies for veterans,  \nto even mapping the universe we live in, AMD technology is opening new doors to a better world.
