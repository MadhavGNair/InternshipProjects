Austin, Texas employees also served meals to the homeless through Caritas \nCommunity Kitchen, and employees in Boxborough, Massachusetts packed 11,000 meals  \nfor Stop Hunger Now.What we learned\nKeep it flexible: While many employees liked being out in the community, others appreciated the flexibility of onsite projects. Hosting volunteer events at the office was successful for \nmany of our sites; in fact, the AMD office in Boxborough, Massachusetts more than doubled \ntheir expected participation rate. We also offered a variety of different causes that our \nemployees could choose to support.\nMake it personal: Email and social media are great tools for getting the word out, but our \nmost effective communications were face-to-face meetings with site leaders who then \nbecame champions for the cause.\nPlan early and share the load: An event of this scope takes a great deal of planning to \nexecute properly. AMD\u2019s global network of site champions were on the front line identifying \nvolunteer opportunities, recruiting employees, and leading projects.\nRecognize and reward: Recognition goes a long way and it\u2019s critical to acknowledge and  \nthank volunteer leaders and participants so they look forward to future activities.\nKeep the spirit going: While one day can definitely make an impact, one of the biggest \nbenefits of the Day of Service model is to raise awareness of the importance of volunteering \nin the community year-round.
