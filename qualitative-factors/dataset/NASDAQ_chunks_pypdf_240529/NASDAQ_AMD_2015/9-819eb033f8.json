Their mantra is \u201cStart Here, Get There. \u201d And for many of the college\u2019s \nroughly 50,000 enrollees, that means spending time in the ACCelerator. A high-tech learning lab, the ACCelerator is home to more than 600 Dell Wyse thin clients \npowered by AMD Embedded G-Series APUs. \u201cThin client\u201d refers to desktop computers that are connected to a server for centralized management so there are fewer points of failure, less susceptibility to viruses or malware, better security, and greater energy efficiency. The ACCelerator uses thin clients for traditional learning and for \ndelivery of a widely recognized and innovative math course called Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS). An adaptive learning program, ALEKS uses \nartificial intelligence to assess proficiency and progress, creating a customized learning plan which allows students to reach college-level math at their own pace with \nthe help of dedicated instructors who give one-on-one attention. \nThe ACCelerator lab is very much in line with ACC\u2019s mission of sustainability. As a signee of the Carbon Commitment (formerly known as the American College & University Presidents\u2019 Climate Commitment), ACC has pledged to make their facility and operations carbon neutral by 2050. According to Andy Kim, Director of Environmental Stewardship, \u201cWe always look at the best value for the district \u2014 which means that we are looking at the value and sustainability attributes of the products or services \nwe buy. \u201d When considering technology options, Mr. Kim believed that the Dell Wyse thin client computers powered by AMD processors would enable the ACC campus to \nreduce their energy consumption (compared with a traditional desktop environment). And he was right. AMD-powered Dell Wyse thin clients are estimated to reduce the \nlab\u2019s energy consumption and GHG emissions by 82%.As a community college, we are there to help anybody \n\u2014in any stage of their learning and formal education\u2014  \nget from where they are to where they want to go. \n\u2013 John Thomason, Professor, Austin Community CollegeCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY  \nSUMMARY MAGAZINE 18 \nTHE USE OF  \nTHIN CLIENTS  \nINSTEAD OF  \nDESKTOPS \nRESULTED  \nIN AN ESTIMATED  \n82% SAVINGS  \nIN ENERGY  \nAND  \nGREENHOUSE  \nGASES\n1\n1 Based on ACC\u2019s typical usage data and calculated using AMD\u2019s Total Savings Estimator available at www.amd.com/en-us/solutions/embedded/thin-client/tco-calculator", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2015.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
