EMBEDDED\nAMD embedded solutions are everywhere \u2014 delivering immersive experiences,  \npowering, protecting, automating, and \ndelivering efficient solutions to industry \nclients. AMD\u2019s embedded solutions offer innovative, graphically rich, scalable features designed to boost performance \nand capabilities while helping to reduce \ndevelopment time and total cost  \nof operation.GRAPHICS\nAMD continues its leadership in graphics architecture and products with award-winning AMD Radeon\u2122 and AMD \nFirePro\u2122 lines featuring the visionary \nGraphics Core Next (GCN) architecture. These graphics technologies are widely used in professional workstations, \ngaming PCs and consoles, servers  \nand embedded designs.\nhis is an exciting time to be in the semiconductor \nindustry, and an even more exciting time to be \nat AMD, as our talented global employees focus \non delivering the high-performance graphics \nand computing technologies that are creating a better future. A future defined by the combination of billions of connected \ndevices, expanding amounts of compute and storage \ncapabilities delivered by cloud servers, and the widespread  \nuse of visually immersive technologies that seamlessly blend \nthe physical and digital worlds. Together, these three trends will fundamentally improve how we use technology to  \ninteract with each other and the world around us.\nAt AMD, we believe that enabling tomorrow means more  \nthan just delivering great products. We must also remain  \ntrue to the beliefs and practices that have made AMD a  \nleader in corporate responsibility for more than 45 years. \nSuccess on both of these fronts requires that we further \nreduce our environmental impact while relentlessly pursuing the best ideas and unique perspectives through a diverse  \nand inclusive workforce.\n This year\u2019s corporate responsibility report highlights several \nexamples of how AMD technologies are improving the world \naround us. From powering new medical breakthroughs \nusing virtual reality to improving education by creating more \nengaging environments or providing the computational \nhorsepower to more accurately map the universe, AMD is \nproud to be leading the way on so many different fronts. \nI am privileged to lead AMD\u2019s thousands of employees \naround the world who are committed to acting as exemplary corporate citizens while remaining determined to deliver  \nthe innovations that will create a better world. \n \nDr. Lisa Su\nPresident and CEOTMESSAGE FROM OUR CEO AND PRESIDENT, DR.
