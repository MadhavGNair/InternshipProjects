ON TRACK FOR 25x 20 \nIn 2014, we announced a goal to accelerate the energy efficiency of  \nour mobile APU processors by 25 times by 2020. The first two products \nlaunched under the goal \u2014 the 6th and 7th generation A-Series APUs \u2014 \nposition AMD ahead of the trend line to meet 25x20.\nACCELERATING ENERGY EFFICIENCY\nTYPICAL USE ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\u201cTigris\u201d\u201cKaveri\u201d6th Generation APU,\n\u201cCarrizo\u201d7th Generation APU,\n\u201cBristol Ridge\u201dRequired Trend\nfor 25x20\nEnergy E\ufb03ciency \nof AMD APUs\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n10xINCREASE IN ENERGYEFFICIENCY(2009\u20132014) 25xADDITIONAL ENERGYEFFICIENCY BY 2020(2014\u20132020)\nEnergy ef\ufb01ciency gains from \u201cBristol Ridge\u201d puts AMD ahead of the trend line needed to achieve our 25x20 goal\nFor more information and substantiation please go to www.amd.com/en-us/innovations/software-technologies/25x20 PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP Security\nWith \u201calways connected\u201d computing devices and the increasing amount of sensitive  \ndata shared digitally, entire societies now depend on secure information technology (IT).  \nA trusted computing environment is a fundamental necessity for any IT infrastructure  \nto function properly. \nThe AMD Secure Processor is our robust security solution that provides built-in security  \non our SOCs and APUs. These products feature ARM\u00ae TrustZone\u00ae technology, a system- \nwide approach to security that enables partner software to run on top of our hardware  \nby partitioning the SOC/APU into two virtual \u201cworlds. \u201d Sensitive tasks run on the AMD \nSecure Processor \u2014 in the \u201csecure world\u201d \u2014 while other tasks run in \u201cnormal operation. \u201d\nWe\u2019ve been incorporating security features into our silicon and partnering with both \nindependent hardware vendor (IHV) and independent software vendor (ISV) companies  \nto create world class solutions for many years. We will continue working alongside \ncustomers, partners and public policy makers to bring innovative security measures  \nto market. Providing security to users of our processors is a top priority for AMD.\nLife Cycle Assessment\nOur aim is to minimize environmental impact at every stage of the product life cycle.  \nIn 2015, we conducted a life cycle carbon footprint study of our 6th Generation A-Series APU, \nwhich was then reviewed by a third party. They confirmed that using the 6th Generation \nA-Series APU can result in up to 50% reduction in GHG emissions compared to the previous \ngeneration APU, while more than doubling battery life and performance per watt.  \n \nThe overall power and GHG savings can be significant for our enterprise customers.  \nFor example, upgrading 100,000 PCs to the 6th Generation AMD A-Series APU  \n(from the previous generation) could save an estimated 4.9 million kilowatt hours  \nof electricity \u2014 or roughly USD$495,000 (assuming U.S. pricing) and 3,350 metric  tons of GHG over a 3-year product service life. These savings are equivalent to the  \nenergy needed to power 461 U.S. homes for a year.Packaging\nWe\u2019ve reduced the net weight of raw materials in our \u201cprocessor in a box\u201d (PIB) packaging  \nby 71% since 2010. The smaller and lighter packaging also utilizes more recycled and  \nreused materials. In the previous five years, the savings from these efficient designs  \nhave been remarkable:\nReduced 644 metric \ntons of raw materials, \nequivalent to the weight \nof 400 average cars  \nSaved more than  \nUSD$3million\nThe AMD carbon footprint study is available at www.amd.com/Documents/carbon-footprint-study.pdf1 For more information please visit www.amd.com/en-us/innovations/software-technologies/25x201 For more information, please visit http://www.amd.com/\nen-us/innovations/software-technologies/radeon-polaris80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n050% GHG drop \nin use phaseKgCO2-e / APU\n\u201cKaveri\u201d\nWater Fabrication\u201cCarrizo\u201d\nAssembly, Test & Pack Product UseCarbon Footprint Comparison of AMD A-Series APUs1", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2015.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
