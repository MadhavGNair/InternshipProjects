Other 2015 environmental  \nresults include a 10% reduction in global water use, and a 77% diversion of non-hazardous waste from landfills. In 2015, the savings from conservation  \nefforts exceeded an estimated USD$4million.\nExpanding Supply Chain Sustainability \nSilicon wafer manufacturing represents the bulk of AMD\u2019s environmental footprint within \nour supply chain. Starting in 2014, we partnered with our semiconductor foundry partners to \nestablish \u201cbest-in-class\u201d environmental goals for AMD wafer production. These goals were \ndesigned to significantly outperform industry averages across environmental and safety \nperformance metrics. AMD and our semiconductor foundry partners are on track for each  \ngoal as of the end of 2015. In 2016, we are expanding this partnership approach to other  \nmanufacturing suppliers.

It aims to educate and \ninspire AMDers around the globe to conserve resources, \nsave money, and improve the environment around them. \nIn 2015, we launched a web portal to support and encourage \nAMD employees in their efforts to improve the environment.  \nCalled \u201cMy Sustainability, \u201d the site lists 60 specific actions \nthat include eating local organic food, carpooling, and turning \noff office equipment each day. Employees can set goals,  earn badges, and see their \u201cEco-Ranking\u201d compared to peers. \nIn 2015, employees entered over 1,000 actions that resulted \nin measurable savings: Employee Eco Awards\nAwarding Eco Excellence \u2014 In 2015,  \nAMD held its 5th annual \u201cEco Awards\u201d  \nto recognize employees\u2019 personal  \ncommitment to sustainability.
