{"page_content": "PLANET  //  17\n/ PLANET\nCLEAN TECHNOLOGY CONTRIBUTIONS \u2013 OUR PRODUCT HANDPRINT\nAnsys develops, markets and supports engineering simulation software used to predict how product designs will behave in real-world environments. Ansys solutions \nsupport our customers in their efforts in sustainability and concerns over climate as well as improving the efficiency, performance and durability of products. This has \nthe positive effect of reducing total material use, increasing energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emission, supporting the circular economy and increasing \noperational performance. \nThrough simulations we support our customers\u2019 investments and innovation to develop and use low-carbon energy, and accelerate their pivot to electrification of \ntransportation, buildings and industrial processes.    \nThis phenomenon of positive impact is referred to by experts as net positive or product handprint.  \nWe believe that arguably most of our revenue impacts design optimization and production, operation of low carbon products or innovations that result in reduced \nemissions as well as material and energy use. \nMore particularly, we derive revenue from sales of our solutions to sectors, like automotive, industrial control, nuclear, wind energy, and hydropower, to name a few, \nthat could benefit the environment with lower emissions and reduced energy and water use. The global push to reduce carbon emissions and decarbonize energy \nproduction and usage demands new products and processes. \nOur engineering simulation software enables development of products that are more green and energy efficient. Our solutions assist with a systemic change towards \nhelping with global efforts on carbon avoidance.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANSS_2019.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
