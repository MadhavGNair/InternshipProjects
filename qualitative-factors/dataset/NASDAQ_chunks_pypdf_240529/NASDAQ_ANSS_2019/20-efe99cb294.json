Our growth and financial strength reflect our leading technology position and commitment to innovation. This commitment \nto innovation ensures that we continue our progress toward our goal of enabling Pervasive Engineering Simulation\u2122 , the trend of simulation being adopted across the \nentire product lifecycle, empowering engineers to imagine and evaluate more design options.\nOur Product Strategy is Based on Pervasive Engineering Simulation\nPervasive Simulation Is:\n\u2022 Integration across all physics on a single open platform\n\u2022 And the injection of simulation into partner ecosystem\nOur Product Stategy:\n\u2022 Continuing investment to extend leading positions in all physics\n\u2022 Leveraging and expanding platform to drive deeper client relationships\n\u2022 Selectively targeting highest-growth market opportunities\n\u2022 Accelerating opportunities and growth through world-class ecosystem\nWe make substantial investments in research and development and emphasize  \nfrequent, integrated product releases. In the last three years, we invested more than  \n18% of our revenues into research and development, expanding the ease of use and  \ncapabilities of our broad portfolio of engineering simulation software products.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANSS_2019.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
