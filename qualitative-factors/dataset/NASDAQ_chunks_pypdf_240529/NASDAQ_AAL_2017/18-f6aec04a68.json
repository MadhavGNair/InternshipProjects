In February, American began selling these no-\nfrills fares to better compete with ultra-low-cost carriers, while still offering an elevated level \nof service and established network.  \nWe also introduced Premium Economy in 201 7 , which offers enhanced seating between \nBusiness Class and the Main Cabin, including benefits such as more legroom and free on-\ndemand entertainment. We now have dozens of widebody aircraft offering this new option. \nIt has been so popular that we will continue to roll out Premium Economy on the majority of \nour widebody fleet. \nIn 2017, we also announced several other product enhancements, including: \n \u2022New, high-quality inflight bedding from Casper, the innovative sleep company\n \u2022More in-seat power, free entertainment and cutting-edge satellite Wi-Fi\n \u2022Amenity kits that feature an updated, chic look and include skincare products from \n3LAB, C.O. Bigelow and Clark\u2019s Botanicals, as well as the usual necessities like an eye \nmask, toothbrush and toothpaste\n \u2022Our Refuel and Refresh program (formerly known as Gateside Amenities) is now \navailable at all airports. During any delay over two hours, we will provide customers \nwith light snacks and drinks right in the gate area. For delays of three hours or more, \nwe will provide sandwiches or breakfast items.Create a World-Class Customer Experience\nWe have elevated the onboard sleep experience as part of a new partnership with Casper.\nSELF-SERVICE REBOOKING\nIn 201 7, we launched Dynamic \nRebooking, our new reservation \nre-accommodation tool that \ngives customers the ability \nto rebook themselves during \nirregular operations, such \nas a flight cancellation. The \nnew offering \u2014 accessible via \nAmerican\u2019s mobile app, airport \nkiosks or on aa.com \u2014 saves \ncustomers from having to \nmake a phone call or stand \nin long airport lines. When a \nflight is canceled, the system \nelectronically sends customers \na recommended rebooking or \nlets them choose the option that is most convenient for \nthem.
