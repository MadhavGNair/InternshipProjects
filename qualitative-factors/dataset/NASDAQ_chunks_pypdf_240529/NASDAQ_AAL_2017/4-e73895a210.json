Since the merger, we kept team member pay competitive through new joint \ncollective bargaining agreements and initiatives such as profit sharing, mid-contract pay increases for pilots and flight \nattendants and similar increases for maintenance and fleet service team members as we work toward a contract. \nDuring 2017, we launched the industry\u2019s best maternity and adoption program. And in early 2018, we also shared \nbenefits of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through $1,000 payments to all non-officer team members.\nWe are committed to improving our diversity and inclusion efforts to provide us with expanded sources of ideas and \nto better reflect our customer base and the communities we serve. American and Mr. Parker joined the CEO Action \nfor Diversity & Inclusion in 2017, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion \nwithin the workplace. American is one of more than 250 organizations that have taken the pledge and committed \nto cultivating a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected, where team members feel comfortable and encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion and where best practices can be shared. \nWe are proud of the diversity and inclusion initiatives already in place at American, but we know we can do even better. \nWe are eager to become global leaders in inclusion and diversity \u2014 and we are energized by the actions we plan to \ntake as a result.\nAs a global airline, we believe it is our responsibility to manage the impact that our operation has on the environment. \nWe purchase renewable energy to minimize our indirect emissions.
