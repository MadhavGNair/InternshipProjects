But we know \nchallenges and \u201cfriction points\u201d can arise, and we want to equip our teams with all the tools and resources \nwe can offer to support them in delivering customer-friendly experiences. With this in mind, we have \nreworked our policies and the product attributes that may contribute to unnecessary conflict: \n \u2022Our contract with every customer \u2014 American\u2019s Conditions of Carriage \u2014 states we will never \nremove a paying customer to seat another passenger. \n \u2022We simplified our Conditions of Carriage to include friendlier language and less corporate speak.\n \u2022Our Day of Departure Desk troubleshoots departure issues across the network, monitoring every \noverbooked flight and getting involved earlier to find volunteers to take a later flight. \n \u2022We\u2019ve established a dedicated hotline for gate agents to offer appropriate compensation that encourages volunteers when we are in an oversale situation. \n \u2022In early 2018, we launched a new technology that allows customer-facing team members to offer \non-the-spot compensation \u2014 in the form of AAdvantage miles \u2014 to customers for inconveniences \nat the first point of contact. \nGETTING FAMILIAR WITH FLIGHT\nOur team members care deeply about ensuring a pleasant flying experience for everyone. For families \ntraveling with children with autism, flying can be \noverwhelming.
