{"page_content": "17\n2017 Corporate Responsibility ReportBaggage performance has been a bright spot, as our year-over-year mishandled baggage rate (MBR) \u2014 the number of \nmishandled bags out of every 1,000 \u2014 improved each month in 2017. American\u2019s MBR is dropping thanks to the hard work \nand innovation of our team members.\n \u2022PRIME is American\u2019s new baggage tracking system that provides a detailed record of a bag\u2019s journey and highlights \nbags that are in jeopardy of missing their flights. \n \u2022Megascan is an initiative in place at our hubs to scan a bag up to 1 0 times. The more times we scan a bag, the more we know about its location and the better chance we have of preventing a mishandling. A bag\u2019s Megascan history feeds \ninto PRIME.  \nWe were also able to minimize inconveniences with the \nintroduction of Customer Bag Notification, a new tool \nthat went live in July 201 7. This tool sends alerts directly \nto customers if their bag doesn\u2019t arrive as intended, saving \nthem time spent waiting at an empty carousel and filing a \nclaim. In most cases, the customer can fill out a form online \nand provide a delivery address, and we\u2019ll bring their bags to \nthem. Early results are encouraging, as nearly 20 percent of customers notified of early or delayed bags are using \nCustomer Bag Notification to set up a bag delivery.Create a World-Class Customer Experience\nBuilding trust with customers is more important than ever to the airline industry today.
