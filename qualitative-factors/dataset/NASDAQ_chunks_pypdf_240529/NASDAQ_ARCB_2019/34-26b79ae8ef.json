As a professional truck driver, he knows the \nimportance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle while on the road. \nIt\u2019s\n\t\nhard\n\tfor\n\ta\n\t\ndriver\n\t\nto\n\t\nfind\n\t\ntime\n\t\nto\n\tget\n\tex\nercise,\n\tbut\n\twith\t\nall\n\t\nthe\n\t\nnew\n\t\nregulations\n\t\naround\n\t\nhealth\n\t\nand\n\tfitness,\n\tmany\t\ndriv\ners have to pay attention to their weight and health. \nI\u2019ve always been involved in sports and athletics, so I\u2019ve \ningrained exercise into my routine. I always exercise before I leave the house, and I\u2019ll stop driving every two hours\n\t\nfor\n\t\nabout\n\t\nfive\n\t\nminutes\n\tt\no\n\t\nrun\n\t\nin\n\t\nplace\n\tor\n\t\nwalk.\n\t\nIt\n\t\njust\t\ntak\nes discipline.\nEating right is also essential. Ralph typically packs his lunches with healthy foods and ensures he drinks plenty of water.  My motto is \u2018Don\u2019t eat anything out of a bag. Eat clean.\u2019 I\u2019ll pack anything that\u2019s natural \u2014 fruits, vegetables and meats that aren\u2019t processed, and I\u2019ll drink a lot of water. Staying hydrated is a big thing. A lot of drivers tend to drink soda instead of water. But as a truck driver, staying hydrated with water is so important to keep our organs from drying up. \nOverall, Ralph enjoys focusing on wellness and encouraging \nother drivers to do the same. \nExercising and eating right makes me feel better, and it makes \nme more alert on the road. I hardly miss work because I stay healthy, and it makes me a better husband to my wife, because I have enough energy to do things with her when I\u2019m home. Overall, wellness makes me a better person. \nRalph Garcia\nABF Freight Road Driver\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2019.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
