A: I love to run, play catch, play basketball, swim and hike with my family. Q: How do you feel about wellness being a company value? A: I think it\u2019s great! ArcBest thinks about our overall health and that speaks to the type of company they are. They invest in and want their people to be happy and healthy. Q: How do you promote wellness in the workplace? A: I jump on conference calls and discuss wellness with coworkers and ask how everyone is incorporating it into their life. I stress how important it is to have a healthy mind. \nShannon Fazikas\nDirectorEnterprise Sales\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2019.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
