I chose to get my MBA through the ArcBest program because I wanted to improve my leadership and people management skills while networking with people within the company. Prior to starting the program, I had a minor interest in Human Resources. The classes provided instilled a passion for HR and people. Now, I work on our Talent Management team as an Employee Experience Project Manager and hope to eventually lead a team of HR professionals. \nMindy Smith\nProject Manager Employee ExperienceLeadership Highlights\n \n\u2022\n The a\nverage tenure of a director is 20 years  \n\u2022\n 167\n\t\nemployees\n\t\nwere\n\t\npromoted\n\t\nto\n\t\nfirst-time\n\t\nleadership r\noles in 2019   \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2019.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
