This program is a partnership with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that allows us to hire potential drivers, even those without commercial driving experience or a CDL, and train them in-house. Program participants receive six weeks of paid training at a service center. At the end of the six weeks, the trainee receives a Class-A CDL with all endorsements and is offered a full-time position. \nNew Initiative: Virtual Reality Training  We continue to invest in innovative technology to make \nlogistics easier for everyone.
