I was overweight, had bad habits \nand was pushing 260 pounds when most of my life I had always been around 190. I was uncomfortable in my own skin. \nWith the positive example his supervisor set, Bobby became interested in making \nchanges to his eating habits and exercise routine. He now enjoys running 5Ks, half- and full-marathons and overall, lives a healthier lifestyle.\nBeing with ArcBest, I was so excited to have Wellness as one of our core values. Seeing \nthat our company truly wants its employees to be healthy and happy meant a lot to me. I\u2019ve never seen a company with such an emphasis on wellness in such a positive way and provide us with tools to help everyone achieve their own personal goals.  \nBobby Terrill\nTruckloadDistrict Sales Manager", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCB_2019.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
