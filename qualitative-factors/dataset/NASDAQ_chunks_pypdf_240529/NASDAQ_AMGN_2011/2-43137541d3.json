{"page_content": "3\nIn 2008, we set six environmental targets: energy, carbon dioxide, water, waste recycling, waste reduction, and the \nfuel efficiency of our U.S. sales fleet. We identified these as areas where we initially could make the most progress in reducing both our environmental impacts and our business costs. We designed our targets so that we track our progress through deliberate efforts we make, without influence from growth or contraction in our business. We use a formal measurement process to confirm results. We\u2019re proud that we have exceeded our energy, water, and waste targets, and we\u2019re on track to achieve the remaining targets by the end of 2012.
