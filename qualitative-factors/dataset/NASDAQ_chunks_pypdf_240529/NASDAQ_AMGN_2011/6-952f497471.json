By year-end 2011, we had exceeded our 2012 target for recycling by 50 percent. We\u2019ve identified a multitude of ways to recycle, including composting landscape, food, and disposable food-service waste; sending lab plastics and other hard-to-recycle items like Styrofoam to be converted to new items; and reusing equipment and office supplies on-site. With this success as a foundation, we are actively shifting to the practice of reducing the waste we generate in the first place.\nAmgen continuously strives to conserve water, a vital component of our \nmedicines. Water conservation solutions we\u2019ve implemented include a wastewater treatment plant in Puerto Rico that enabled approximately 318,000 cubic meters of treated wastewater to be recycled on-site in 2011 and low-water landscaping and smart-irrigation controls at a variety of facilities.\nWater Intake Water Intake Avoided* Through \nConservation Efforts3,000\n1,000\n5002,000\n1,5002,5003,500\n2009601\n2,537\n2008550\n2,738\n20073,286\n2010663\n2,574\n2011673\n2,586\n*Value represents year-over-year, cumulative avoidance.2007\u20132011 Water Intake and Intake Avoided* \nThrough Conservation Efforts (1,000 m3)WaterPerformance\n442\n0", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2011.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
