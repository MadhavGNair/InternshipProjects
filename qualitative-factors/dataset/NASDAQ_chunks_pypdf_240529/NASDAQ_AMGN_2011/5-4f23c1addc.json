Energy conservation also has a direct impact on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO\n2) we emit through \noperations. These are areas where we\u2019ve made an active effort to gather the knowledge we\u2019ve gained and share it across our facilities\u2019 networks. In 2011, projects and initiatives we\u2019ve executed both to limit our environmental impact and to achieve our targets resulted in energy savings of approximately 181,000 gigajoules and a CO\n2 \nreduction of 15,000 metric tons (MT). \nOur improvement target for the fuel efficiency of our U.S. sales fleet \nhas driven our approach to fleet management over the years. We\u2019ve steadily expanded fuel-efficient-vehicle choices available for mobile staff, rotating less-fuel-efficient vehicles out of the fleet for more-efficient options that achieve 23 miles or more per gallon.\n2007\u2013201 1 U.S. Fleet Fuel Use a nd Fuel Use Avoided \nThrough Conservation  (Per 1,000 Gal)*\n2,000\n1,000\n500\n01,5002,500\nFuel Used Fuel Use Avoided Through \nConservation Efforts20071,498\n20091,297173\n20081,44315\n20101,849347\n20111,794380Fuel Efficiency4,019245\n4,006\n36Performance", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2011.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
