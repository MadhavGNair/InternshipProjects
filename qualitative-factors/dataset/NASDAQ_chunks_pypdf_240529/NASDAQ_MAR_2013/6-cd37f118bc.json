Also, for \nMarriott to expand and continue to be successful, associates \nmust be motivated and committed to personal growth and \nadvancement, seeking opportunities for promotion and \nachievement of professional objectives.Through skills training programs, professional development \nopportunities and optional learning experiences, Marriott \nprovides associates with a multitude of choices for developing \nboth professional and personal skills and talents. Marriott \nassociates participate in about 10,000 training classes every \nyear. Associates can also take advantage of a wide variety of \neLearning and self-paced learning options. A few of our \nnewest programs include:\n\u25a0 In 2012, we launched The Professional Leadership Program, \na one-week leadership program for high-potential leaders \nfrom around the world. These senior-level managers have \nbeen identi\ufb01  ed as being ready for near-term career \nadvancement and the course exposes them to innovative, \nadvanced leadership practices. Participants identify their \nstrengths and areas for growth, and create an action plan \nto support ongoing development.\n\u25a0 Marriott\u2019s Women in Leadership (WILL) program helps our \nwomen leaders assess and determine leadership and business \nchallenges, develop successful leadership pro\ufb01  les, identify \nleadership development expectations, de\ufb01  ne the impact of \ncultural issues, and create measures of success. Participants \nare immersed in an intensive leadership development \ncurriculum including executive coaching.\nIn November 2012, we launched the Marriott Culinary \nApprenticeship Academy (MCAA), in the United Kingdom to \ntrain and offer young people a viable career in the culinary and \nhospitality industry. Apprentices who successfully complete the \nprogram are guaranteed an entry-level chef position at a Marriott \nhotel. We also launched a pilot Engineer apprenticeship program \nin London, which recruited young people to work in our hotels \nunder the guidance of our engineering teams. Across Europe, \nwe continue to offer apprenticeships in all areas of the business. Fifteen years ago, Tanya Ritter worked the overnight shift in Room \nService at the Melbourne Marriott. Within three months, she was promoted \nto the Front Of\ufb01  ce and later progressed to front of\ufb01  ce manager. She took \nadvantage of training opportunities and networked with other hotel \nmanagers to share best practices. As a result of Tanya\u2019s experience and \ncommitment to the company, she was recently promoted to operations \nmanager at Courtyard\u00ae North Ryde in Sydney, Australia.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2013.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
