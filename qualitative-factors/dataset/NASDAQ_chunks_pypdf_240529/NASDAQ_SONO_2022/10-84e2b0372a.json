{"page_content": "In FY22, Sonos conducted our first climate risk screening \nassessment. The screening evaluated physical and transition \nrisks and opportunities using the framework established by the \nTask Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \nIn alignment with that guidance, we examined the potential \nimpacts of climate change on our business operations up \nto the year 2050. Our physical risk assessment considered \nthe effects of climate-related events, including extreme heat, \nwater stress, flooding, storms and fires, on our offices and the \nlocations of our contract manufacturers. This initial screening \nfound that Sonos' exposure to such physical risks is low. \nDuring the screening, we found that transition risks (such as \nlegal, reputational, and policy changes) are more difficult to \npredict and require further investigation. In FY23, we will plan  \nto expand the scope of our risk analysis and explore a full  \nTCFD report.\nEnvironmental Social Governance ESG Supplement2022 Listen Better Report\n11Climate Change Risks", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SONO_2022.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
