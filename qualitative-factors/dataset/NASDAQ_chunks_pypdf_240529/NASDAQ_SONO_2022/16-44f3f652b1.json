{"page_content": "Product Sustainability\nNEW COLOR, LOWER IMPACT\nDuring the research and development of our PCR plastic, \nwe learned that the existing shade of white used in our \nspeakers was difficult to match. When plastics from landfill \nare recycled, all light colors are combined to create light \ncolored material, resulting in a distinct shade. Knowing \nthis, we challenged ourselves and developed a new white \nto accommodate PCR plastic without compromising on \npremium quality and durability. Our new white will be used \nacross our portfolio going forward.\u201c This shade is softer and \nblends in better with home \ninteriors, while retaining \nthe product longevity our \ncustomers expect. We are \nexcited to bring this more \nresponsible white to market \non products launching in \nFY23 and beyond.\u201d\nKITTY SUIDMAN\nHEAD OF PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY AT SONOS\n2022 Listen Better Report\nEnvironmental Social Governance ESG Supplement 17", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SONO_2022.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
