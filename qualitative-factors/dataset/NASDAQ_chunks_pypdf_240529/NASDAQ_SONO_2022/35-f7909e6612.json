In FY22, we received  \n63 requests for information from law enforcement agencies \nin the U.S. and Europe, 33 of which provided sufficient \ninformation and were granted. The overwhelming majority  \nof these requests come from customers who reported \nproducts stolen from their homes.\nMaintaining high levels of privacy and cybersecurity takes \nmany hands. All employees are required to complete privacy \nand security training to ensure the company can suitably \nprotect the security and privacy of our systems, products and \ndata, including customer data.\nWe engage with third-party privacy organizations to identify \nareas for improvement and solicit feedback on our approach. \nMembers of our team regularly attend events hosted by the \nInternational Association of Privacy Professionals, the largest \nglobal network of information privacy experts, and participate \nin their KnowledgeNet program to stay up to date on the \nprivacy landscape.\nWe also seek feedback on our security practices from \nthe global community.
