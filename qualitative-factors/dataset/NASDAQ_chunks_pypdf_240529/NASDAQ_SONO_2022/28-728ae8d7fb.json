{"page_content": "How we acted\nWe conduct regular supply chain audits as part of our strategy \nfor identifying, mitigating and preventing risks across our \nsupply chain. In FY22, we audited 100% of key suppliers \nthrough the RBA Self Assessment Questionnaire or on-site \naudits, achieving our FY25 target of 100% of key suppliers \naudited annually. Our on-site audits covered 70.8% of key \nsuppliers in FY22. \nIssues found during audits are categorized based on their \nseverity: critical, major or minor. In FY22, we identified a total \nof 359 findings during audits, deeming 12 critical (3.3%), 212 \nmajor (59.1%) and 135 minor (37 .6%). Of the critical and major \nissues, 89.7% were closed within the target time, progressing \ntoward our FY25 goal of 95% of critical and major issues \nclosed within target time. The remaining three critical issues \nand 20 major issues are actively undergoing improvement. \nThe most common issues concerned working hours and \nemergency preparedness and response plans.   \nAs part of our partnership with RBA, we set a goal in FY21 \nto conduct in-person audits (in coordination with RBA) of at \nleast 50% of suppliers where we identified critical issues in \nthe previous year. In FY22, we surpassed this goal by auditing \n100% of suppliers where critical issues were identified.How we keep trackSupply Chain Responsibility\nPerformance\nTarget Annual \n50%of suppliers with critical \nissues audited in person, \nin coordination with RBA\nPerformance\nTarget FY25\n10 0%of key suppliers  \naudited annually\nPerformance\nTarget FY25\n95%of critical and major \nissues closed within \ntarget timeKey Suppliers Audited(%)\nFY20F Y 2 1F Y 2 2F Y 2 5\nTarget40%74%70%100%Critical and Major Issues Closed \nWithin Target Time\n(%)\nFY20F Y 2 1F Y 2 2F Y 2 5\nTarget85%89% 90%95%Key Suppliers Audited\n(%)\nFY20F Y 2 1F Y 2 2F Y 2 5\nTarget40%74%100% 100%Critical and Major Issues Closed \nWithin Target Time\n(%)\nFY20F Y 2 1F Y 2 2F Y 2 5\nTarget85%89% 90%95%ACHIEVED2022 Listen Better Report\n29 Environmental Social Governance ESG Supplement", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SONO_2022.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
