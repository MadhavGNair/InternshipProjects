{"page_content": " 3\nPreface analog.com/sustainability\n 1This report may contain forward-looking statements that include, among other things, statements about our sustainability efforts, economic impacts, environmental, \nhealth, and safety performance, stakeholder engagement, product stewardship, and labor practices that are based on our current expectations, beliefs, assumptions, \nestimates, forecasts, and projections, and which are subject to change. Those statements are not guarantees of future performance, but rather are inherently uncertain and involve risks and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed in this report, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations and beliefs as of any date after the date of this report.Preface\nScope\nThe data in this report cover the two-year period ending on December 31, \n2015, unless stated otherwise.1 Between scheduled biennial reporting \nperiods, updates are provided on the ADI website, analog.com/sustainability. When available, information is included for four fiscal years. This report is limited to our directly managed operations and wholly owned subsidiaries. ADI does not participate in any joint ventures.\nThis report amalgamates the company\u2019s sustainability efforts across four \nkey areas of sustainability: economic prosperity; environment, health, and safety stewardship; social well-being, and governance and ethics. We have used a materiality determination to identify the most relevant topics to address in this report. Each of the following was used to deter -\nmine the content for this report: GRI G4 reporting guidelines, resource utilization (energy, water, and materials ), waste generation, major \nsustainability-related impacts and opportunities, information covered in other semiconductor manufacturing companies\u2019 reports, feedback from stakeholders, including employees and investors, and comments from sustainability experts. \nAdditional information about ADI\u2019s business operations and financial \nperformance can be found in our annual reports on Form 10-K and in our financial statements. \nThe ADI website also provides more detail about our environmental, health, \nand safety activities. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines and other information on our management structure are also available on our website. \nIn addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to our \ndirectors, officers, and employees, is provided on our website. We seek to make available on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that are required to be publicly disclosed. Boundary\nThis report contains information updated from the 2012\u20132013 Sustainability Report, along with additional information regarding ADI\u2019s sustainability programs. ADI has used the GRI Boundary Protocol to establish the boundary of this report, which includes operational data and management performance for activities that have a significant impact and in which ADI has direct control or significant influence. For transparency, this report also includes descriptions of some relevant activities in which ADI does not have an influence over significant impacts. \nAssurance\nIndependent auditors review our environmental, health, and safety objec-tives, targets, and programs during the semiannual surveillance audits undertaken to maintain certifications to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. \nMuch of the financial data included in the Economic Impacts section of this \nreport is drawn from the financial statements included in our Form 10-K filings for 2014 and 2015. Those financial statements were audited by Ernst & Young LLP .\nOur sustainability report was reviewed by outside consultants with relevant \nexpertise. Additionally, our greenhouse gas emissions calculations have been independently verified and certified. We continue to evaluate other forms of assurance as our sustainability program matures.\nFeedback\nWe welcome stakeholder comments and feedback, which provide impor-tant input for the continual improvement of our sustainability programs and performance.
