{"page_content": "2\nPreface 2014\u20132015 Sustainability Report\nA Message from Our CEO \nThank you for your interest in Analog Devices\u2019 \n(ADI) Sustainability Report for 2014\u20132015.\nIn 2015, ADI celebrated its 50th anniversary\u2014 \nfifty years of delivering innovations and \ntechnologies that have changed the world by facilitating dramatic advances in communications, healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, and scientific inquiry. We achieved this milestone through an \nunwavering commitment to engineering excellence, tight alignment to market dynamics, and focus on our larger stakeholder ecosystem including our employees, customers, partners, communities, and investors. These same principles guide our actions today and ensure that ADI will remain a vibrant business for the next 50 years and beyond.\nADI\u2019s tagline, \u201cAhead of What\u2019s Possible,\u201d reflects our focus on the future. \nMany of the innovations the world will marvel at tomorrow are being developed at ADI today. Sometimes, those innovations take years or even decades to achieve their full potential. The toughest technological challenges\u2014the ones that most excite and inspire us\u2014defy easy or short-term solutions and by necessity require a longer-term perspective.\nThat long-term perspective requires ADI to take a broader, more comprehensive \nview of our web of interconnections here and now. It requires thinking through actions and reactions and causes and consequences in everything we do. From our facilities, to our assets, to our materials, to our operations, sustainability isn\u2019t just a corporate social responsibility initiative; it\u2019s a business imperative.\nAt ADI, we pursue sustainability along four axes\u2014economic, environmental, \nsocial, and governance and ethics.\nEconomic sustainability\u2014While ADI is in business to make a profit, we are \nfocused not just on the next quarter but on ensuring that our technological innovations continue to have impact and our employees and investors continue to share in the success of ADI for years to come. Our best-in-class financial model, global operations, and smart supply chain management are just a few of the ways we are able to successfully serve our stakeholders while maximizing our ability to pursue the business practices and innovations that support our longer-term success.\nEnvironmental sustainability\u2014To update the famous saying, any intel-\nligent fool can make things more wasteful and harmful. It takes a touch of genius\u2014and a lot of courage\u2014to move in the opposite direction. ADI approaches the environmental impact of its operations, including the manufacturing and distribution of its products, with the same focus on innovation as it does the design of those products. We are committed to conserving resources, minimizing the environmental impacts of our opera-tions, and providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees and the communities in which we operate. We view this as an economic imperative as much as an environmental one.\nSocial sustainability\u2014ADI\u2019s stakeholder ecosystem extends beyond the \ntypical focus on employees, customers, and investors to the communities and world in which we operate. We strive to be a positive influence in our communities by living up to the highest ethical standards, pursuing socially minded business practices, providing rewarding career and employment opportunities, and giving back to our communities in concert with our employees\u2019 individual efforts.\nGovernance and ethical sustainability\u2014Ethical behavior has been a core \ntenet of our company\u2019s values since our earliest days. Our employees, across all locations and job functions, have internalized the value of ethical behavior, routinely going beyond mere compliance with applicable laws and regula-tions. Our long history of leadership in the area of governance and ethics has resulted in a trusted reputation among our customers, investors, and employees, as well as the communities where we operate. That is a trust that we have worked hard to earn and one we don\u2019t take lightly.\nThis focus on the long-term and growing a sustainable business has given \nADI the ability to deliver life-changing innovations for 50 years. \nWe are in technologies that even a decade ago were still science fiction \nbut today we take for granted. We are in cell phones that put the world\u2019s information at the world\u2019s finger tips. We are enabling the emergence of remote personalized healthcare management and treatment systems. We are in devices that are verifying the quality of our food and medicines. We are enabling more sustainable agricultural processes that are increasing both crop yields and nutrition. We are in applications that are used to monitor and reduce air and water pollution. We are improving fuel efficiency in cars and trucks, enabling drivers to operate their vehicles more safely, and saving lives daily through more effective, safer airbag deployments.\nWe are pleased to share this report, which catalogs the ways in which we have \nbuilt a sustainable business that 50 years after its founding continues to bring incredible innovations to life. We pledge ourselves individually and as a company to remain focused on the future and staying Ahead of What\u2019s Possible.\n\u2122\nSincerely,\nv \nVincent T.
