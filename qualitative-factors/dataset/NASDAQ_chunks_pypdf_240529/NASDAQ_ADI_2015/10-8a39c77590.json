The CRB routinely reviews regulations and industry standards and drives actions to address potential impacts. We regularly perform environmental management systems certifi-cations and track and review our EHS performance against goals. \nReview Process\nWe regularly review the aspects and impacts of our operations as part of our environmental management systems certification. This review is in the form of quarterly internal assessments and surveillance and recertification audits. Our management systems are certified to ISO 14001 and in process of upgrading to the recently released ISO 14001:2015, in addition to OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001, and TS 16949. We are proactively planning to upgrade OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001 when that standard is finalized. Where opportunities for continual improvement exist, they are evaluated and considered for implementation.\nWe track and review our EH&S performance against goals on a regular basis. \nResults of our review are reported to management on a quarterly basis, and responsive actions are implemented where appropriate. \nWe have also engaged a third-party auditor to conduct compliance audits of \nour facilities once every three years. The most recent corporate EH&S audit was conducted in 2015 for all manufacturing sites. Any risk areas identified by those audits are evaluated and appropriate steps are initiated to manage and reduce them. Any opportunities for improvement resulting from those assess-ments are evaluated and considered for implementation, including energy and water efficiency and conservation programs.\nWe maintain records and documentation relating to government inspections \nand share that information on a quarterly basis across sites to continually improve our EH&S management system. During the time period covered by this report, we received a number of awards related to our EH&S performance, including being named the U.S. National Most Valuable Pollution Prevention Awardee (MVP2 ) 2015. This has inspired our \nemployees to further excel in these areas. We will share a few of their experi-ences with you in this report. \nADI participates in the annual Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) EH&S \nperformance metrics survey. We use the survey results to identify opportunities \nfor improvement and benchmark performance with other industry leaders. \nBusiness \nThis sustainability report examines the progress we have made toward our five-year goals in the following areas:\n\ufffd Energy\n\ufffd Emissions\n\ufffd Water\n\ufffd Waste\ufffd Materials\n\ufffd Chemicals\n\ufffd Land use and biodiversity\ufffd Regulatory compliance\n\ufffd Occupational safety and health\nIn addition to absolute values, we calculate our emissions relative to our manufacturing production output (surface area of silicon processed ) \nand report those calculations as \u201cnormalized\u201d emissions. With overall manufacturing volumes holding consistent, we have improved our efficiencies and thereby continue to reduce normalized emissions overall.\nWe routinely review measures of our performance relative to planned \nactivities; those metrics indicate that we have successfully met our 2015 reduction goals in air emissions, and by forming programs around water consumption, waste generation, and energy use to continue to make progress toward our objectives.
