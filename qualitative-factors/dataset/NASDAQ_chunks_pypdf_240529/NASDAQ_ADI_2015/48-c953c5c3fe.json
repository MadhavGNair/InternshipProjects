ADI strives to improve the strategic clarity around investment priorities, ensuring we focus our valuable R&D dollars on the most promising opportunities where we can achieve and sustain growth and profits.Transportation\nADI has adopted a strategy of storing most finished product in warehouse operations that are either adjacent to or in regional proximity to the facilities where the parts finish the manufacturing process, allowing us to ship from these operations directly to our customers and distributors. In conjunction with our regional warehouse strategy, ADI has focused on reducing the transit points for shipment to our end customers in all regions. We continue to focus on streamlined flows to improve the efficiency of our transportation flows in conjunction with our transportation partners for reduction of emis-sions in global supply chain logistics. Exceptions to this occur only when service level requirements necessitate local stocking. In addition, we actively pursue efficiencies by consolidating all customer shipments to a given region to the extent possible. \nFor the transportation managed by ADI, the company partners with a limited \nand select number of transportation service providers. We rely on these companies making the investments required to develop sustainability best practices, and we believe that they have active, robust programs in place. \nPackaging\nProperly packaging our products to adequately protect them against damage during transit is critical. While safeguarding our product is key, we strive to achieve this without adding unnecessary extra packaging, or fill content. Our warehouse operations team has developed a goal of continu-ous waste reduction through development of a paperless environment initiative using RF wireless technology where applicable in our distribution centers. Additional programs to reduce our packaging footprint for our products have resulted in significant reductions in paper usage throughout our logistics supply chain. We continue to employ a lean approach in both our internal and external partner warehouses and our transportation suppliers for reduction of waste. It is our aim wherever possible to use materials that can be fully recycled by the recipient. Packing and shipping operations are also reviewed to reduce paper generation, printing only those forms that are essential to the process. For inbound shipments, ADI utilizes approved partners for recycling of packaging materials.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2015.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
