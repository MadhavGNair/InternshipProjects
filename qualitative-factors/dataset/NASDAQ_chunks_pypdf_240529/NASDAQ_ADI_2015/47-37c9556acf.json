These devices are typically installed on the back of a watch or other device strapped to a skin surface. The emit-ted light is reflected by the skin or internal tissue. The amount of reflected light or the ratio of multiple light frequencies can discern certain medical parameters. Pulse rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) devices are already being sold by our customers, and other useful medical parameters are being developed. This is useful for fitness monitoring as well as general medical conditions.\nCamera Shake Reduction Devices\u2014ADI Helps Keep Your Photos Sharp\nFor many years, ADI has provided a series of products that are used to autofocus the lens in cameras from cell phones to high end digital SLRs. In the past couple of years, we have added the ability to stabilize the lens against camera movement. These products, such as the ADXRS290, sense movement or rotation of the camera body and counter this by moving the small capsule holding the lens. The result is an image focused on the backplane sensor that doesn\u2019t move while the shutter is open. These devices are being used in high end cameras as well as in medical scanners to provide better resolution in diagnostic images. Newer appli-cations include virtual reality headsets.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2015.pdf", "page": 47, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
