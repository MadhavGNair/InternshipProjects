The NRWA brings together citizens, scientists, engineers, and local officials to solve real-world problems. They work at the city and town level, recruiting volunteers to test water and carry out hands-on restoration projects, visiting schools to educate kids about water, and working together with communities to stop water waste and pollution.Matching Community Gifts Program\nFor over 50 years, our employees have made a difference in the com-munities where we operate. In support of employees\u2019 generosity, we provide a matching gift program that enables employees to receive a match for their financial contributions to nonprofits. The goal of this program is to give ADI employees a say in how the company distributes a portion of its charitable donations. Certified nonprofit organizations are eligible to receive matching gifts if they are not primarily religious or political in purpose, and if their services are available to all individuals on an equal basis. In addition, we support the cultural organizations in the greater Boston area where we operate our corporate headquarters and employ several thousand people.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2015.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
