Our core curriculum of programs target learning that is linked to ADI\u2019s internal Leadership Characteristics, and is meant to address development needs identified in an employee\u2019s individual career and management path. \nOur learning and development resources include the following: \n\ufffd Tuition reimbursement for all full-time employees, up to $5,250 for \nundergraduate education and $7,500 for graduate education annually in the United States (amounts vary outside the U.S. ). \n\ufffd A formal, instructor-led leadership development curriculum for first level, middle, and senior managers.\n\ufffd An online e-learning system with 18 professional and management courses targeted to managers, available globally 24 hours a day, seven days a week in 28 countries.\n\ufffd Computer business simulation programs targeted to select high potential leaders to improve business and financial acumen. \n\ufffd Internal and external executive coaches for targeted development. \n\ufffd A New College Graduate Orientation Program that exposes recent gradu-ates to ADI\u2019s history, products, people, and technology. \nIntern/Co-Op Program \nADI offers full-time paid internships and co-ops to qualified candidates. In 2014, ADI hired nearly 100 interns and 109 in 2015 in North America. Across Europe, ADI hired 87 and 81 interns in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Within China, ADI hired 20 and 13 interns in 2014 and 2015, respectively. During their assignments, ADI interns and co-ops have the opportunity to work on challenging and meaningful projects with top engineering talent. ADI also helps identify intern requirements that are feeders to specific new college grad requirements. ADI makes every attempt to fill those requirements with graduating students to maximize potential job opportunities for students returning to school for their final year.\nCo-Op/Intern Sample Work Assignments \n\ufffd Design Engineering: Analysis, design, simulation, and evaluation of analog \nsignal processing cells and mixed-signal circuits. \n\ufffd Applications Engineering: Develop customer product evaluation software and hardware for IC products. Some assignments for an applications intern include board layout improvements, VA component creations, board characterization, and phase noise debugging on an ADI part. \n\ufffd Product/Test Engineering: Perform characterization and test development activities for the successful development and release of new products. Perform characterization/yield analysis data collection and complete analysis reports for use by product/test engineering staff in support of device evaluations and qualification. \n\ufffd Advanced Development: Develop next-generation analog integrated circuit processes and devices in silicon and silicon germanium. \nNetworking and Professional Development \nInterns have the opportunity to network with managers, engineers and other interns. Social outings such as a welcome breakfast, bowling in 2014, Dave and Buster\u2019s in 2015, three brown bag lunches, and professional develop-ment seminars are among the many events planned to complement their regular assignments. In addition, at the end of each assignment all students have an opportunity talk about their work with a broader base of engineers and managers at the Poster Presentation Showcase.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2015.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
