At the time, the organization was a small and effective three-person operation with much bigger aspirations: to fully restore the Ipswich River to its natural state on behalf of future generations. \nBuoyed by Analog Devices\u2019 commitment, the Ipswich River Watershed \nAssociation was able to successfully secure similar sized pledges from \ntwo additional local corporate supporters and more recently a third donor has joined this effort. With these generous donations the watershed can continue to work toward its ambitious river restoration strategy. With this invaluable gift the vision of a fully restored river for people and nature seems more possible than ever. \nThe following are some of the specific achievements made possible due \nin part to Analog Devices investment in the Ipswich River:\n\ufffd Produced a detailed River Restoration Action Plan for the river to guide our work\ufffd Surveyed and assessed more than 1000 man-made structures \n(bridges, culverts, etc. ) that restrict fish and wildlife movements and \nobstruct the natural flow of the river and its tributaries throughout the \nwatershed\n\ufffd Secured funding for the removal and/or improved fish passage at all three of the mainstream dams on the river, which will make the Ipswich the only free flowing river in eastern Massachusetts\n\ufffd Reduced the impact of water withdrawals overall and halted the decades-long trend of declining river flows such that the flow regime in the river has begun to improve\n\ufffd Led the statewide effort to enact the nationally recognized Massachusetts Sustainable Water Management Initiative based in part on the ground-breaking research in the Ipswich\n\ufffd Water used by businesses and certain households has been reduced dramatically\n\ufffd Grew the organization from 350 to over 1000 active members, doubled the size of the budget, and increased staffing to six employeesCommunity Contributions\nADI is committed to the communities in and around where we operate. Much of the company\u2019s volunteer, philanthropic, and community investment activities are managed at the site level and many are initiated by employees who have a passion for their causes. This approach not only ensures that our very active employee base is able to remain involved, but also allows them to determine how best to leverage ADI resources given the needs of the specific communi-ties in which they live and work, and the specific organizations to which they volunteer their time and donate funds. We are continually impressed with the energy and dedication that our employees exhibit in giving back to society, protecting the environment, and providing for those in need, and we support them in their efforts. One way we do this is through the company\u2019s Matching Gifts Program, which provides employees a voice in how ADI distributes a por -\ntion of its charitable donations. Employees who make donations to charitable causes can have their gifts matched by the company.Like most companies, we receive several hundred requests for funding each year. We target programs that benefit the communities where our employees live and work.\nThe Corporate Contributions Program\nEach year, Analog Devices donates to human services, art and cultural \norganizations, community organizations, and environmental organiza-tions through its Community Contributions Program.\nMatching Grants to Education\nThis program was created as part of Analog Devices\u2019 overall Education \nSupport Strategy. ADI has made an ongoing commitment to the support of education in the belief that a well educated population is critical to suc-cess in a global economy. All accredited secondary schools, colleges, and universities are eligible to receive matching grants under this program.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2015.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
