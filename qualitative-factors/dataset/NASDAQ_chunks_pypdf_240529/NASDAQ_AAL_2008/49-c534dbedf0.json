Many hotels, cruise lines, and rental car companies offer \nsubstantial discounts to our team members. For more than 70 years we have operated a member-owned credit union, a cooperative \u201cbank\u201d that pays savings \nrates above those that commercial banks provide, provides loans at below-average \nrates, and offers a range of financial planning and credit counseling services.\n\u2022 Retirement Benefits\n Since the beginning of 2002, American has funded more than $2 billion to our  pension trust funds and another $1 billion to other defined contribution programs \nfor our employees. For this, PLANSPONSOR magazine named American Sponsor \nof the Year for its ongoing strategic approach and unwavering commitment to retirement plans for approximately 133,000 participants.  The company\u2019s commitment remains. Despite a challenging year in 2008, AMR continues to fund its defined-benefit pension plan and continues to match employee 401K programs. Most importantly, under the Pension Protection Act \nfunding provisions, our pension plans remained more than 80 percent funded at \nthe beginning of 2009, and we do not anticipate benefit restrictions in 2009.\n In addition to the pension benefits we provide, retirees who have achieved specified ages and years of service continue to enjoy subsidized health insurance for themselves and their family, can purchase a range of other health \nand welfare coverages, and have access to travel privileges on American, Eagle, \nand many other airlines.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2008.pdf", "page": 49, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
