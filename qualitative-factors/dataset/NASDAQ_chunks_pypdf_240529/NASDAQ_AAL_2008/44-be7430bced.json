Heather Bell is a former flight attendant \nfor American. Thanks to the interests of Heather and her fellow flight \nattendants, the endangered Tennessee purple coneflower is proposed for \ndelisting from the endangered species list due to recovery \u2014 a rare event.\nWhile American\u2019s flight attendants were not solely responsible for this \nsuccess, past donations from American\u2019s flight attendant recycling program \nsupported The Nature Conservancy\u2019s (TNC) purchase of property to protect \nthis flower. The recovery efforts of TNC and others funded by donors like \nAmerican\u2019s flight have made it possible for this flower to be considered for \nremoval from the endangered species list.\nHeather is now a natural resource specialist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, the agency responsible for the listing and recovery of endangered \nspecies, and was proud to share the news with her former peers. We \nthought this news would be equally interesting to readers of our CRR. \nAmerican\u2019s flight attendants continue their philanthropic traditions today. \nAMR is proud of the results they achieve and thanks each of them for their \ncontinued interest and effort. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2008.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
