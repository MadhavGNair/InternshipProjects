Women- and minority-owned businesses are among the \nfastest growing segments of the economy. They are important to American, \nboth as customers and as suppliers. Investing in the growth of entrepreneurial, minority- and women-owned businesses in our major locations is important for \nour communities, for building mutually beneficial business relationships, and for the \nenvironment. \n As an airline, American is an economic engine that fuels economies around the world, and it is our responsibility to extend the opportunity for women- and minority-owned and small businesses to grow and prosper as part of our supply \nchain. Since the inception of our Supplier Diversity Program in 1989, American \nhas spent more than $3.6 billion with certified women- and minority-owned businesses. \n  In addition to our direct expenditures, we require majority contractors on major projects, such as airport terminal construction, to meet diversity objectives in their \nsubcontracted work.
