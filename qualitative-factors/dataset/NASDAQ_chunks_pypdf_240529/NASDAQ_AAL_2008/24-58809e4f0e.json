To facilitate this continuous effort, we \nconsulted with industry leaders to develop our Partnership for Safety (PFS) \ninitiative. PFS is a joint effort between management, unions, and employees that focuses on safety at work and at home.Teamwork may seem like an overused buzzword. But since no single person can get an airplane safely off the ground, teamwork and safety are inseparable \nprinciples. AMR\u2019s PFS is perhaps the ultimate teamwork experience. \n The initiative began at our Chicago station in 2004. In 2008, we completed \nthe extension of this initiative to all U.S. and Canadian stations, representing \napproximately 75 percent of our employee network. In 2009, PFS has expanded internationally, starting at London Heathrow, our largest international station.
