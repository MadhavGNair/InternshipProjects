Even simple \nthings \u2014 a briefing by the captain to the cabin crew or safety walks by \nmanagement and union representatives \u2014 are signs of goodwill and \nteamwork. As part of PFS, employees focus on safety by establishing teams to investigate employee injuries, and, most importantly, identify the \nbest preventative measures. Through this effort, teams have recommended \nand implemented changes that reduce injuries. Examples:\u2022 Turbulence injuries are reduced in-flight because of the efforts of a task \nforce of flight attendants and pilots. As a result of their recommendations, turbulence safety tips are posted on the flight attendant Web site, and turbulence information is more prominently displayed on AA.com.\n\u2022 With the support of front-line employees, policies were strengthened to \nmake highly visible safety vests the standard garment for any employee \u2014 or employee doing business on our behalf \u2014 who works in the \nairport operating area or who is involved in ramp operations. New vests \nare required to be brighter, more reflective, and break-away style.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2008.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
