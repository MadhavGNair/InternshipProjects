American uses a combination of third-party advisers, newly formed external advisory councils, ERGs, and relationships with \nkey advocacy organizations to gain insights into how to provide the best travel \nexperience for all customers.\n Because service is the focus of our diverse segment and women\u2019s marketing efforts, we recognize that we must go beyond marketing and sales to deliver a positive travel experience. Only then will we be successful in earning customer loyalty and \nretaining brand equity we\u2019ve built over our 80-year history. Some examples of how \nwe do this are highlighted in the box on page 55.\n\u2022 Featured Diverse Segment and Women\u2019s Organizations\n Although American partners with numerous organizations around the world, some \nkey organizations supported by AMR include the Minority Business Council and the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council.
