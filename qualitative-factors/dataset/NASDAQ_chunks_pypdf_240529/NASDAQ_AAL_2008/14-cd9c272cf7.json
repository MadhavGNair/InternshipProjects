To ensure ethical compliance with both the \nletter and spirit of the laws in every country in which we do business, we developed a Business Ethics \n& Compliance Program and adopted standards \nof business conduct for all employees. The basic principles of our standards:\n\u2022 Safety is the first consideration at AMR. It is \ncrucial that all employees perform their jobs with the highest regard for safety \u2014 both for our \ncustomers and their fellow employees.\u2022 We do not take unfair advantage of anyone \nthrough manipulation, concealment, abuse of \nprivileged information, misrepresentation of material \nfacts, or any other unfair-dealing practice. \n\u2022 We do not tolerate unlawful discrimination, \nharassment, or hate-related behavior.\n\u2022 We continually encourage our employees to be \nresponsible for their own actions. No one will \nbe excused for misconduct just because it was \ndirected or requested by someone else. \n\u2022 We educate our staff that they are also responsible \nfor the conduct of employees reporting to them and can be held responsible for negligently failing \nto take reasonable steps to prevent and detect criminal conduct by their employees. \n\u2022 We encourage all our employees to immediately \nreport suspected illegal or unethical activity, including financial fraud/accounting matters. \n\u2022 We do not tolerate retaliation against employees \nwho act in good faith by reporting suspected illegal acts or unethical behavior and we are prepared \nto react swiftly against anyone encouraging such \nbehavior with corrective action and possible termination. \nThrough our business ethics and compliance training and an annual compliance certification, we provide \nanti-corruption and business ethics training to all upper-\nlevel management and most lower-level management employees. In 2008, 91 percent of this group had completed this online training.\n7  They in turn \ncommunicate our standards to their staff.
