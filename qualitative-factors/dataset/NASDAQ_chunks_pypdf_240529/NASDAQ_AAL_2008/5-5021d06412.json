{"page_content": "5 AMR Corporation \u2022 Corporate Responsibility ReportAbout This Report2\nThis report is our first corporate responsibility \nreport (CRR) and represents our efforts to expand the scope of our reporting to include more in-depth social and economic aspects of AMR Corporation (AMR). Close followers of AMR \nwill note this was one goal set forth in our 2007 \nenvironmental responsibility report (ERR). We are happy to have achieved that goal and present this CRR, our first fully integrated record of corporate citizenship, economic impact, and environmental performance. This CRR is for calendar year 2008.\nThis report has been completed to meet the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \nLevel C reporting requirements for AMR, the parent company of American Airlines \n(American) and its regional affiliate, American Eagle (Eagle). Unless otherwise \nspecified, any reference to AMR indicates that the subject material applies broadly to both airlines. Where constraints associated with data collection have limited our \nreporting ability in select areas, we have estimated relevant values or \nincluded statements indicating whether we believe the incomplete measurements are material. \n2GRI standard disclosure 3.1-3.8, 3.10-3.11, 4.14-4.15", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2008.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
