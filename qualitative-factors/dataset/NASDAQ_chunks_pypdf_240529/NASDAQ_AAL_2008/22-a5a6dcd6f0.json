Examples of these collection and analysis \nprograms include:\u2022 Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA): FOQA collects and analyzes digital flight \ndata generated during normal flight operations. This data provides greater insight into the total flight operations environment.\n\u2022 Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP): The foundation of ASAP is a safety \npartnership between the FAA, AMR, and our employee labor unions. The program\u2019s focus is to encourage voluntary reporting of any safety issues and events that come to the attention of pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers, and maintenance workers. \nEvents or issues are analyzed, and corrective action is taken when necessary. In \nconjunction with the FAA, American was the first airline to implement ASAP . \n\u2022 Internal Evaluation Program (IEP): IEP audits and inspects company policies, \nprocedures, and systems to identify and correct potential findings before they occur. IEP provides a functionally independent review beyond what is required for regulatory compliance.For all of us at AMR, our first \nand top priority is the safety \nand security of our co-workers \nand customers.
