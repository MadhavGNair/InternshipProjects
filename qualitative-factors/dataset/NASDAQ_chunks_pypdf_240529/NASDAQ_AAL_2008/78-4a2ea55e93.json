{"page_content": "Global Community \u2022 Global Commitment 78Awards47Improving Customer Service During Disruptive Weather\nWeather, high passenger loads, and air traffic control (ATC) issues \u2014 among \nother operational issues \u2014 also are part of the daily challenges for the airline \nindustry. While poor weather and congestion related to the ATC system are \nbeyond our control, American has taken decisive steps to improve overall performance and reliability during those situations. \n\u2022 Storm Policy: Customers who call to request changes based on \nanticipated weather disruptions can receive change-fee waivers and will \nbe accommodated to reach their destinations as close as possible to their \ndesired dates. This policy assists in reducing the number of potentially inconvenienced customers during disruptive weather. \n\u2022 Improved customer notification about reaccommodation: When \na flight has been canceled for disruptive weather or ATC issues, we notify \nand give priority reaccommodations to our most frequent customers \u2014 \nthose who have achieved Executive Platinum, Platinum, Gold AAdvantage\n\u00ae \nstatus \u2014 as well as to AAirpass members, elderly travelers, people with \ndisabilities, unaccompanied minors and those who\u2019ve purchased first-class \nand business-class seats. \n\u2022 Enhanced diversion plans: When an aircraft must be diverted to \nanother airport, we make sure that the diversion airports are equipped with the necessary equipment to handle arriving aircraft. For example, \ndesignated diversion airports that previously didn\u2019t have stairs to allow \npassengers to deplane from a Boeing 757 aircraft now have them. Additionally, diverted international flights are sent to airports with U.S. \nCustoms facilities, so American has the option of deplaning customers if \nnecessary. Diverted flights are spread across several airports to reduce backups on the ground. \u2022 Active seat management: Seats held for delayed in-bound customers with \nno chance of making a connection are released for other passengers. \n\u2022 Trip insurance: Customers can go to AA.com to buy this protection, which \nprovides reimbursement of prepaid, non-refundable travel expenses when a trip is \ncancelled, interrupted or delayed. \n\u2022 Customer communication during extreme weather events: In each \nairport, we supply information brochures to customers delayed by extreme \nweather. The brochures contain comprehensive information on how to proceed without having to contact an airport agent or reservations representative. \nBrochures also include important locations in the airport, hotel and other \nfrequently used phone numbers, information about vouchers, frequently asked questions, and links to related AA.com Web sites. \nAmong the accolades received by American for reliability and dependability:\u2022 Business Traveler readers give American top honors\u2022 Global Traveler names American best in domestic first class\n\u2022 Brazil magazine names American best international airline\n\u2022 American Airlines Cargo wins an award at AirCargo 2008 Conference\u2022 American named best economy/coach class at OAG Airline Industry \nAwards\n\u2022 AA Cargo Division receives customer excellence and innovation award \nfrom Descartes Systems Group\n47GRI standard disclosure 2.10", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2008.pdf", "page": 78, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
