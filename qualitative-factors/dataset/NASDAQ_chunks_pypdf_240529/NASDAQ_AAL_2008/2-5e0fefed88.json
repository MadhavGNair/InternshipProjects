{"page_content": "Global Community \u2022 Global Commitment 2\nDear Friends of AMR Corporation:\nFor more than 80 years, through good times and bad, AMR Corporation (AMR) has sustained its \nposition as one of the world\u2019s leading airlines. We have not done it alone. Our success has been \nbuilt on the support of our customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities we serve and \ncall home. In turn, we have done our best to make AMR a good place to work, a good neighbor, a positive contributor to the economy, and a reasonable investment.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s corporate responsibility report is commitment. The report aims to provide a \nclear picture of AMR\u2019s commitment to being a responsible corporation and describe the steps AMR \nis taking to meet the commitments made to the company\u2019s many constituencies. The report also \nhighlights how AMR\u2019s employees demonstrate genuine care and citizenship in communities around the world beyond compliance with government rules and regulations. \nThis year\u2019s report has been enhanced in two important ways. First, it contains much more \ninformation than last year\u2019s report, in keeping with AMR\u2019s commitment to communicate with \nemployees, customers, suppliers, communities, and investors. Second, the report provides more \nexamples of AMR employees volunteering their time and talent to bring the value of these activities to life.\nThe choices AMR makes will always be driven by the values and aspirations that have sustained the \ncompany for more than 80 years. We are committed to improving our performance each and every \nyear. I encourage you to chart our progress in the years to come.\nGerard Arpey\n1\nChairman, President, and CEO\nAMR Corporation and American Airlines\n1GRI standard disclosure 1.1\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2008.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
