American employees who didn\u2019t even know each other provided \na one-of-a-kind experience for the families. Emotions ran high as teary-eyed employees checked in baggage. One stood in full salute as the children and \nparents were taxied in.\n\u201cEveryone wanted to make sure it was an incredible experience for the kids, \nbut as it turned out, it was an incredible experience for us,\u201d says Seattle agent \nTina Towner.AMR, Airpower Foundation Give It Up\nfor Veterans and Military Families  \nAMR employees are passionate about helping veterans and military \nfamilies.\nThat sentiment was evident at the 2008 annual Airpower Foundation\u2019s \nSky Ball on Oct. 11, when more than $600,000 was raised for families \nof north Texas military members serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nMore than 750 American volunteers supported the event, attended by \nmore than 3,000 guests.

The iBOT\u00ae, a state-of-the-\nart mobility device, provides significantly more flexibility and freedom \nto users than ordinary wheelchairs. But the $25,000 price tag keeps it \nfrom being an option for most soldiers.\n\u201cHelping North Texas military families is important to the employees of \nAmerican Airlines and American Eagle because they know these are our neighbors fighting to defend our freedom,\u201d said Mike Snyder, Fort Worth \nAirpower Foundation chairman. \u201cThese employees have made this effort \ntheir own. Without their passion, this cause and this event would not be possible.\u201d\nFor its efforts, AMR was honored with the Tony Orlando Yellow Ribbon \nAward in recognition of its commitment to veterans\u2019 initiatives.\nInauguration of the Flagship Freedom aircraft in \nrecognition of the men and women in the armed forces.\n12GRI standard disclosure 4.12", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2008.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
