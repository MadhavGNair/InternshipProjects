In last year\u2019s report, we provided detailed descriptions of many \nFuel Smart programs. We are happy to report that this program has matured into a steady source of fuel savings initiatives that in 2008 resulted in a reduction of 111 million gallons of fuel that would \nhave been combusted if these initiatives were not in place. Our goal is to increase this to 120 million \ngallons by the end of 2009.\nIn last year\u2019s ERR, we provided detailed fleet renewal plans as part of our long-term strategy to reduce fuel consumption \nand lower operating costs. These efforts \nhave been bolstered by the mid-2009 announcement of an order for eight more \nBoeing 737-800 aircraft, scheduled for \ndelivery beginning in 2011, in additional to the 76 aircraft that will be delivered in 2009 \nand 2010.Run-Rate\u00a0Fuel\u00a0Savings \u00a0(millions)\n20046080100120\n200520062007200848849596111\n21GRI performance indicator EN4\n22GRI performance indicator EN5 and EN18", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2008.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
