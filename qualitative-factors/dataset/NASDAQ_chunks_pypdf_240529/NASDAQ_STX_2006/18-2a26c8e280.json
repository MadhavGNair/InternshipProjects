Hancock discussed the importance of developing a global perspective to maintain job competitiveness. \n\"Adaptability and cultural agility are key skills we look for when hiring new talent at Seagate,\" Hancock said. \" Building relationships is key to being successful in today's global marketplace. You can have the best technologies and the best systems in the world, but if you don't have people that can work well together--across borders, time zones and languages--the project has an increased potential to fail.\" \nAlso representing Seagate were Nahid Afshar, executive director of business excellence for RMO and product development, who welcomed the more than 5,000 attendees during the opening reception, and Charlotte Narvaez, an e-business project manager who joined a panel sharing their professional experiences with teenage girls attending the Seagate-sponsored Young Women's Program. \nreturn to top >\nhttp://ehs.seagate.com/gc_annual_report/comm_invol_case.htm (7 of 7)12/15/2006 5:41:12 AM", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2006.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
