Indeed, we are aiming to use 100% renewable electricity \nacross Mondel\u0113z International manufacturing sites by 2030.  \nThis includes working with governments and suppliers to \ngenerate and purchase renewable electricity where we operate.\nThis transition integrated into the electrification roadmap  \nalso can deliver reductions on the consumption of fuels. \nIn 2022, approximately 39% of the electricity used in our \nmanufacturing sites was renewable, compared to approximately \n32% in 2021.We are focusing on both increasing our \nenergy efficiency and our use of renewable \nenergy across Mondel\u0113z International \u2013 so \nwe can aim to go further in reducing our \ncarbon emissions and reducing our costs.Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan (MENAP) \nProgress Against End-to-End CO2e Reduction Goal \nby 2025 - Renewables\nWe signed several agreements across Egypt, Bahrain \nand Pakistan during 2022 that aim at accelerating the \ninstallation of solar. In Pakistan, the hub confectionery \nplant will become the first MENAP site to commission \nsolar-energy sources. The system is anticipated to be able to \ncontribute to a CO\u2082e reduction of 79 metric tonnes annually. \nIn Bahrain, we have an agreement to utilize over 4,200 \nsolar panels for both rooftop and carport applications. \nOnce completed, the solar plant is expected to produce \n3,820 megawatt-hours of clean energy in the first year \nof operation, equivalent to reducing carbon emissions by \n2,400 metric tonnes, and potentially allowing us to convert \n24% of our energy usage into clean energy. In Egypt, we \nsigned an agreement that will seek to convert 11% of the \nenergy in Borg El Arab (BEA) to clean energy. \nRecovering Heat from our Biscuits Ovens\nOur factories in La Haie-Fouassi\u00e8re (France) and East Suzhou \n(China) implemented heat recovery systems in their biscuits \novens. These initiatives are saving natural gas previously \nused in the same oven or in other equipment. The reduction \nin fossil fuel consumption from both initiatives is saving \nmore than 6,000 CO\u2082e metric tonnes per year.\n100% Renewable Energy in Brazil\nThe business unit reduced it\u2019s CO\u2082e footprint while \ngrowing\u00a0in volume.\nIn Brazil, volume increased, so we needed to review our \nenergy strategy to enable sustainable growth. With the \nfocus of contributing 2025 end-to-end carbon reduction \ngoals, the market invested in a new source of energy \nin order to produce 100% snacks in its factories using \nrenewable energy. This builds upon progress made by  \nthe Brazil business unit in 2021.OUR ENERGY PROGRESS\n2019 2020 2021 2022\nTotal energy consumed 18,089,730 17,967,884 18,051,643 17,900,000\nTotal renewable energy (%) 8% 23% 32% 39%\nManufacturing Scope 1 and 2 CO\u2082e \nemissions from energy  \n(CO\u2082e market-based Metric Tonnes)11,336,793 1,189,684 1,132,844 1,060,000\nCO\u2082e emissions reductions across \nour\u00a0manufacturing operations by 2025 \n(vs.\u00a02018)-5% -15% -19% -25%\n1 For Scope 1 and 2 conversion factors applied, please see the Carbon Accounting Manual\nOverview Social Sustainability & Human Rights Sustainable Packaging Sustainable IngredientsClimate & Environmental\nStrategy & Performance Snacking more mindfully more SuS tainable Snacking governance colleague & c ommunity Well-being", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2022.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
