That\u2019s why \nwe engage in multi-stakeholder engagement to help improve \naccess to education. \nFor example, we are a part of the Child Learning and Education \nFacility (CLEF), a collaboration between the Jacobs Foundation, \nthe UBS Optimus Foundation, the Ivorian government, and \nthe broader cocoa sector. The collaboration aims to reach \napproximately 5 million children in cocoa-growing areas and \nprovide them with improved access to quality primary education. \nLack of access to quality education is an underlying cause of \nchild labor, and with a target investment of CHF110 million, \nthis initiative, led by the Ivorian government, has the potential \nto provide a blueprint for public private partnership that can \nreplicated by other countries in the future as a systemic solution.\nWe are also joining forces with peers, suppliers, and local  \nchild protection authorities to implement area-based landscape \napproaches, under the umbrella of the International Cocoa \nInitiative (ICI).\nTo learn more, see our video \u2018 Growing opportunities through \neducation \u2019.

To help tackle these challenges, with support of \nCocoa Life\u2019s implementing partner CARE, the community \ndeveloped a CAP, established a Community Development \nCommittee, provided training to community members,  \nand established VSLAs. \nThe community\u2019s discussions and action plans are focused \non four goals: diversifying the sources of income of \ncommunity members; constructing a local health center; \nconstructing three classrooms with a director's office and \nteachers' accommodation, and installing a village hydraulic \npump.

Events were conducted in  \nrural communities, focusing on education, health, hygiene, \nand women empowerment, covering topics ranging from \nfinancial literacy to safe working environments. \nIn addition, the school infrastructure development project \nin the states of Andhra and Kerala benefited with provisions \nsuch as classrooms, dining halls, bathroom, toilets,  \nand drinking water facilities across these schools.\nhelping to \nlift c ocoa \ncoMMunitieS  \ncont.\n\u201c At Cocoa Life in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,  \nwe continue to collaborate with implementing \npartners and government bodies to help \nmake cocoa farming more profitable, \nempower communities and protecting forests. \nCommunity Action Plans are key to help lift \ncocoa communities so they can advocate \nfor their development needs and shape their \nown future.
