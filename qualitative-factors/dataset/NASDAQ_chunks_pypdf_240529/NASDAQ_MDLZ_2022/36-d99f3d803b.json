Our Progress\n246,000Cocoa Life registered farms \nmapped and monitored\n415,000Community members and farmers \ntrained on Good Environmental \nPractices.\n6,720,000Economic shade trees distributed1By the end of 2022, we distributed over 6.7 million non-cocoa (or \nshade) trees. The distribution of non-cocoa trees is an important \npart of more sustainable cocoa farming: they help safeguard \ncocoa against too much sun and heat, help promote biodiversity, \nand can help provide additional income for farmers.\nAs Cocoa Life continues to scale up, farm mapping continues \nto be crucial. Unless we understand where, and under which \nconditions, cocoa is produced, we cannot identify areas to help \nstop deforestation. Farm mapping is vital to help identify problem \nareas and guide us where actions are most needed. As new farmers \nand cooperatives join the Cocoa Life program each year, mapping \nprogresses, often requiring collaboration with agents across \nindividual farms in hard-to-reach areas.\nWe have mapped more than 246,000 farms in an effort to gain a \ndeeper understanding of the needs of farming communities and \nthe boundaries of farms.\nUnderstanding Our Impact On Forests \nWe work with our partner Satelligence, a remote sensing \ncompany, to understand Cocoa Life\u2019s impact on natural forests  \nby applying satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes  \nthat can indicate likely deforestation events. \nSatellites continuously circle the earth collecting data, and  \nevery year there is more information available on global  \nland use. More information means better models. \nThis year, Satelligence introduced a new machine-learning  \nmethod to measure deforestation rates and used an updated \nforest baseline providing a more comprehensive overview  \nof the remaining extent of mature natural forest globally. \nThis new model was applied to both Cocoa Life\u2019s 2021 and 2022 \nprogress data, aiming to reiterate the results published in the \n2021 Snacking Made Right Report in May 2022 using the updated \nforest baseline. This allows us to compare how the scale-up of the \nCocoa Life program influences our deforestation footprint. Helping to Protect Landscapes Where Cocoa Grows\nWe believe conserving the land and forests is a promise to future \ngenerations. Forests help stabilize the climate: they regulate \necosystems, protect biodiversity, drive more sustainable growth \n\u2014\u00a0and play an integral part in the carbon cycle. Climate change \nremains one of the biggest challenges facing our planet, its  \npeople \u2013 and businesses \u2014 and the cocoa sector has a key  \nrole in helping to tackle this issue. Developing a more sustainable, \nscaled and thriving cocoa supply chain will help us to reduce \nour total GHG footprint and in turn, achieve  \nour long-term goal to realize net zero CO\u2082e emissions.\nOur work in the area of forest protection and restoration is \ntargeted to needs of farming communities and driven by the \nlocal external environment. The cocoa-producing regions in West \nAfrica and Indonesia experience wide-spread deforestation, \nwith cocoa farming being a key driver. In India, cocoa farming is \nseen as an additional source of income for farmers who practice \nintercropping with other crops such as coconut or areca nut.  \nIn Brazil, cocoa farming helps to restore degraded pastureland.\nWe focus on supporting farming communities with the right on \nand off-farm tree planting activities and applying farm mapping \ntechnologies and agroforestry techniques. To do that, we look at deforestation signals starting in 2018 until \nthe latest available data (2022), in alignment with our Cocoa & \nForest Initiative ambitions. \nBy using an updated forest baseline, the results show a smaller \nshare of forest disturbances in Ghana on Cocoa Life participating \nfarms in 2022 compared to those farms participating in 2021. \nHowever, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, we detected a slightly higher rate of \nlikely deforestation events on Cocoa Life participating farms in \n2022 compared to the farms participating in 2021.2 As a result, we \nsee near to no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life farms \nin West Africa since 2018 (approximately 0.7% in Ghana & 1.3% in \nCote d'Ivoire).\nThese rates show that only a small number of Cocoa Life \nparticipating farms have any likely deforestation events. However, \nwhere there are occurrences, we will prioritize our engagements \nwith supply chain partners to help identify the potential high-risk \nareas, help prevent future deforestation, and help rehabilitate \nimpacted areas as appropriate, as currently mentioned on page 15 .\n1 Reported information covers Brazil, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire , Dominican Republic, Ghana, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria.\n2 Updates have been made to the metric's reporting methodology for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Reported performance for 2021 covering C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana has been revised for year-over-year comparison.\u201c Our collaboration on deforestation \nassessment based on Cocoa Life farm \nmapping data and Mondel\u0113z International \ncarbon footprint assessment exemplifies \nour joint commitment to sustainability.  \nBy working together, we are able to \ncalculate emission factors specific to land \nuse change, to help drive positive change \nfor more sustainable cocoa production,  \nand ultimately for our planet.\u201d\n Niels Wielaard  \n  CEO & Founder  \nSatelligence \nOverview Social Sustainability & Human Rights Climate & Environmental Sustainable PackagingSustainable Ingredients\nStrategy & Performance Snacking more mindfully more SuS tainable Snacking governance colleague & c ommunity Well-being", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2022.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
