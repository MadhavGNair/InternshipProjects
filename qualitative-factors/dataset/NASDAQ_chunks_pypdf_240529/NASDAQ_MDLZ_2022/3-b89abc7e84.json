Our insights guide our \ngrowth strategy, inform our purpose to \nempower people to snack right, and form \nthe basis for the vast knowledge estate that \nwe\u2019ve amassed on the important and e ver-\nchanging role snacking plays in our \neveryday lives.  \nAnd in a year like 2020, our instinct to learn \nfrom people and to put our consumer at the \nheart of everything we do, has proven more \nimportant than ever. Our second annual \nState of Snacking Report underlines what \nwe have long known to be true: even in the \nface of worldwide uncertainty with COVID -\n19 reshaping our rituals and routines, \nsnacking is a growing behavior with the \npotential to provide comfort, connection \nand community,  while also providing the \nmoments of respite, reward and relief as \nconsumers look to balance nutrition and \nemotional well -being.\nOur proven expertise in the understanding \nof global trends and consumer behavior is \ncomplemented by this independent \nresearch, which uses direct consumer \npolling from 12 markets around the world to \ngenerate a rich, fascinating and entertaining \npicture of how we snack today. The insights \ngleaned from thousands of consumers once \nagain confirm our strategy is the right one \nas we continue to take a bite from the $1.2 trillion total snack industry and fulfil our \nmission to lead the future of snacking, \nwith the right snack, for the right \nmoment, made the right way. \nAs the global snacking category continues \nto grow, and we all adjust to our new \nnormal, it\u2019s not surprising that almost 9 in 10 \nadults worldwide say they are snacking \nmore or the same during the pandemic than \nthey were before. Digging deeper, \nmillennials and those who are working from \nhome right now are especially likely to say \nthey prefer snacks over meals. It pleases me \nto know that more than half of global adults \nsay snacking has been a \u201clifeline\u201d for them \nduring the pandemic, especially parents \nwho are working from home, and for whom \nsnacks have provided welcome nutrition for \nthemselves and treats for their children. \nTaking time out for a snack, from a familiar \nand much -loved brand, can prove to be an \nantidote to our busy lives and an avenue for \nconnection with others during these \nunpredictable times. \nAt Mondel \u0113zInternational, we have long \nknown that emotional well -being plays an \nimportant role in why we snack, alongside \nhealth and nutrition. We\u2019re committed to \nhelping people around the world be more \nmindful in the way they enjoy our products, \nwhich range from wholesome bites to \nindulgent treats. Hearing our consumers \ncontinue to highlight the importance of \nsnacks that enable them to lead healthier lifestyles or that provide a boost or comfort, \nreinforces to me that snacking will continue \nto thrive as part of our new normal, finding \nits place alongside a renewed focus on \nhealth and an ever -more holistic view of \nwell-being.\nWith more snacking happening at home, \nconsumers is have more opportunities to \npractice mindful snacking habits, with two \nthirds of respondents in our study noting \nthey now have more control over their \nsnack portion sizes and that they are now \nmore aware of the snacks their bodies need. \nFor over 6 in 10 people, snacks are also \nnourishing their \u201cbody, mind and soul \nduring these strange times,\u201d underscoring \ntheir important role in our lives.\nThinking about my own life, I know savoring \na few squares of my favorite Cote d\u2019Or \nchocolate or passing a box of Triscuits\nbetween my family as we come back \ntogether at the end of the day, have been a \nsource of comfort, connection and \ncommunity that have, at times, been \ndifficult to find in this year of isolation. I \nhope you feel the same.\nI\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what \nsnacking mean in our lives today: You\u2019ll find \nmore as you read through this year\u2019s State \nof Snacking: 2020 Global Consumer \nSnacking Trends Study.
