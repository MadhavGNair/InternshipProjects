{"page_content": "Water, energy, and food are three vital components of  \nsustainable development. The interaction of these factors is \ncommonly referred to as the Water-Energy-Food Nexus  \n(WEF-Nexus). The lynchpin of the WEF-Nexus is water\u2014as a \nfinite resource, water scarcity has a direct impact on food  \nsupply. If a local WEF-Nexus spirals out of balance, lack of \nwater shifts from being a global sustainability concept to a \nmore local and immediate problem. \nToday, nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s population lives in  \nwater-scarce regions. As the impact of climate change  \nintensifies, more regions grapple with water scarcity and  \nassociated WEF-Nexus pressures. Key indicators of  \nlooming environmental reforms include:\n\u25a0 More frequent droughts and rising food prices\n\u25a0 Consistent overdraws on river systems and aquifers\n\u25a0 Agricultural inefficiency\u2014low yields and/or tilt to  \nnonfood crops\n\u25a0 Impact of pollution on public health and quality of life\n\u25a0 Low unemployment\u2014politicians can address ecological \nissues when there is less economic pressureAs the pull on this finite resource pushes more and more \nregions into water scarcity, we anticipate greater intervention \nfrom governments as they struggle to manage their water, \nenergy, and food resources. In turn, this is likely to have a downstream effect for the energy, utility, and transportation \nsectors as well as other sectors that are indirectly exposed  \nto the WEF-Nexus.\nWhen we observe one WEF-Nexus component fall out of  \nbalance, we can analyze how it will affect the other  \nWEF-Nexus components and the companies that operate \nwithin them. China offers an example of this. An overreliance \non coal blended with relatively lax environmental standards \nhas thrown China\u2019s WEF-Nexus out of balance and resulted  \nin health hazards, water shortages, and threats to food  \nsupplies. In response, the Chinese government targeted  \n10 industries that overextended China\u2019s natural resource \nbalance\u2014with the goal of reducing waste and  improving efficiencies. \nThough it is still early on for an expected multi-decade  \neconomic restructuring, our team continually evaluates  \nhow companies are faring with wide-ranging industry  \nreforms, as we believe insights into ESG factors will play  \nan important role alongside financial analysis.\n 18  |  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2018   |  T.
