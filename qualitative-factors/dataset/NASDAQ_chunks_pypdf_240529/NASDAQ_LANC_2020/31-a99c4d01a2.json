The key to our approach is measurement, \nand we work to continually improve our data quality and stewardship.\nMateriality\nMaterial Entities/Boundaries\nOf our 20+ locations, roughly 44% reflect 80%+, and 56% reflect \n90%+ of our physical area and headcount. Therefore, unless otherwise \nspecified, the disclosures in this CSR focus on the most material parts of \nour business, and are not considerate of co-packers and related service \nproviders. \nDefining Report Content\nTo prioritize the issues of most importance to our stakeholders, we hired \na third-party consultant to assist us in assessing disclosure topics. Our \nassessment focused on identifying, prioritizing, and validating aspects \nfrom the following key sources: \n \u2022  Investors  \u2022 Customers\u2019 views (e.g., client survey, etc.)  \u2022 Employees\u2019 views (e.g., employee survey, etc.)    \u2022 Lancaster Colony\u2019s sustainability strategy documents   \u2022 Feedback from key internal stakeholders  \u2022 Industry protocols (GRI, SASB, CDP , UN, etc.)  \u2022 Market research  \u2022 Regulatory drivers  \u2022 Authorities and surveys of U.S. environmental attitudes\n \u2022 Findings from peer benchmarking studies  \u2022 Leadership alignment  on decisions and timings of proposed \n  pay changes\nFinally, for each topic, we determined the boundary of applicability. \nFor example, when considering [X], our boundary included [Y]Material Aspects\nThe aspects Lancaster Colony has defined as material for this CSR, \norganized by disclosure categories and sub-categories, are as follows:\n \u2022 Corporate/Reporting \u2013 Governance Structure, Privacy, Ethics,  \n  Brands/Products/Markets, Facilities/Countries, Workforce/Union,  \n  Supply Chain, Stakeholder Engagement, Privacy\n \n \u2022 Economic \u2013 Performance, Innovation\n \u2022 Environment \u2013 Energy, Water, Waste\n \u2022 Social \u2013 Health and Safety, Human Capital (Training, Engagement,  \n  Diversity), Community\n \u2022 Reporting \u2013 Materiality, Stakeholder Engagement\n For more information contact: \nClarence Mingo, Vice President \nESG and Corporate Affairs \nclarence.mingo@lancastercolony.com", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LANC_2020.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
