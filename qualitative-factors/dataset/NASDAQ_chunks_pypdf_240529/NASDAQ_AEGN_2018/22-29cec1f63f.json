By excluding, we lose influence. We exclude some investments, however \u2013 where there is unacceptable risk or no scope for improving performance or transforming existing business models (the case, for example, with tobacco); these exclusions are set out in Aegon's Responsible Investment Policy. \nOn behalf of Aegon, we exclude companies involved in controversial \nweapons, thermal coal production, oil sands and tobacco\n27. \nAdditionally, we exclude investment in government bonds and  \nother forms of debt from fifteen countries \u2013 where there are international sanctions in place, or evidence of systematic violations of human rights. Our exclusions support Aegon\u2019s Responsible Business approach; they are a response to clear health or environmental concerns and \u2013 in the case of coal and oil sands \u2013 are in line with our commitments under the 2015 Paris Pledge.\nFor other affiliated or third-party clients, there may be exceptions \n\u2013 usually because of client preference or specific fund structures.We do, however, engage with our clients, where possible, tosuggest they apply the same exclusions\n28.\nW\ne also reserve the right to exclude other companies with a \npoor ESG record \u2013 if, after a period of engagement, they do not take sufficient steps to improve performance. In such cases, our Responsible Investment Strategy Committee (RISC) decides on next steps; divestment and exclusions are options we consider.\nPreferred / bondholder\nRoutine / businessRelated to directorsCapitalizationReorganization & mergersNon-salary compensationRelated to anti-takeover34%\n43%\n10%Votes against management proposals by subject\n0%\n1%11%\n1,4471%\nRoutine / businessRelated to directorsCorp. governanceSocial / human rightsCompensationGeneral economic issuesHealth / environmentOthers / miscellaneousSocial proposal10%9%\n53%Votes in favor of shareholder proposals by subject\n3%\n13%\n6%4%0%\n2%15727 A list of exclusions may be found online at www .aegonassetmanagement.com.
