The ILG\u2019s report \u2013 \u2018In search of impact\u2019 \u2013 was launched at the beginning of2019; it proposes metrics in six areas: resource security,healthy eco-systems, climate stability, basic needs, well-beingand decent work; each one is linked directly to the SDGs.The result would be a dashboard, allowing investors to assessESG performance at a glance. By doing so, it should giveinvestors insight into real-world impacts \u2013 and help drivemore investment towards the SDGs.\nFor more information on Aegon Group\u2019s approach to the SDGs, see our 2018 Integrated Annual Report, available online at www.aegon.com.\nRelevant SDG and underlying targets Aegon Asset Management contributionLink to Aegon\u2019s \nbroader Responsible Business approach\nNo poverty (SDG1) 1.2: By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion \nof men, women and children living in poverty in all its dimensions, according to national definitions.
