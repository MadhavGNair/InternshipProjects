When investing responsibly, we have to balance various factors \u2013 not only the needs of society and our clients, but also regulation and the financial markets. \nWe have a clear, comprehensive approach to responsible invest-  \nment built around: \n\u2022Investment analysis \u2013 ensuring we integrate ESG factors\ninto our decision-making across asset classes and investment \nstrategies.\n\u2022 Active ownership \u2013 playing an active role as an investor, voting \nat shareholder meetings, engaging with the companies we \ninvest in and, in some cases, excluding investment where this is \nin line with our policy.\n\u2022 Responsible investment solutions and impact investments \n\u2013 developing new products, funds and strategies that offer a\nresponsible approach, while also investing in  assets that \ndeliver not only financial returns, but also seek positive social \nand /or environmental impact.\nTo support our strategy\n, we have a clear system of governance \n\u2013 Aegon\u2019s Responsible Investment Policy sets out the Group\u2019sposition on key social and environmental issues (see page 12).\nWe have a long history in responsible investment. Over the years, \nour approach has evolved. An initial focus on exclusions (for \u2018sin\u2019 sectors such as tobacco and alcohol) has given way to more integration, engagement and dedicated solutions and strategies. In the years ahead, we expect our strategy to evolve further, with more emphasis on impact investments that support long-term sustainable development. \nClimate has been an important part of our strategy since \n2014 \u2013 we invest in clean and renewable energy, engage extensively on climate change issues and, on behalf of Aegon\n9, \nare divesting from companies that derive 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal or oil sands production.  \nIn 2018 \u2013 following our first report against recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \u2013 we started to measure and benchmark part of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio\n10, and carried out detailed analysis of \ndifferent climate scenarios.\nResponsible Business \nLaunched in 2018, Aegon's Responsible Business \napproach is built on three pillars: \u2022 \nFinancial security and well-being for customers\n\u2022 Secure retirement and healthy aging for society\n\u2022 Clean energy and sustainable real estate for\nthe environment.\nFor Aegon, this is about helpi ng people achieve a lifetime \nof financial security \u2013 this  mean s smart, long-term \nfinancial planning. It also means  healthier lifestyles, \nredefining retirement, and building a cleaner environment. \nThis Responsible Business approach   is about addressing \nchanges in society \u2013 particula rly concerns about aging, \nclimate and the long-term affo rdability of social \nhealthcare systems. \nThe approach also means suppor ting the UN's \nSustainable Development Goals \u2013 five in particular: No \npoverty, Good health and wel l-being, Affordable and \nclean energy, Decent work and ec onomic growth, and \nClimate action; these are the  goals Aegon believes are \nmost relevant to its business. \nAs Aegon Asset Management, our p rincipal contribution \nis through not only ESG integrat ion and engagement, but \nalso through investments in ar eas like renewables, green \nbonds, care homes for the elderly and affordable housing \nFor more information on Aegon  Asset Management's \ncontribution to the SDGs, pleas e see page 2411. \n9See page 2 for all notes, references and definitions; these include definitions of scope with regard to both Aegon and our approach to exclusions. \n10 In 2018, we measured the carbon footprint of our Dutch General Account and insurance-linked equity investments.\nFor more information, see our TCFD reporting from page 28.\n11 For more details on Aegon\u2019s strategy and approach to the UN SDGs, see the Company\u2019s 2018 Integrated Annual Report, available online. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2018.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
