{"page_content": "Volunteerism is woven into the fabric of AMD culture. Every year we \namplify the spirit of giving back through our annual AMD Cares Day of \nService \u2014 encouraging our global workforce to volunteer in educational, societal and environmental projects, reinforcing our longstanding commitment to our communities. \nWith COVID-19 and social distancing, community service has taken on \na different look as we expand our definition of volunteering to include acts of kindness towards others. Instead of team events, employees are shopping for homebound or elderly neighbors, delivering protective masks and meals to frontline health workers, raising money for various causes, donating blood, cleaning up around their neighborhoods, making phone calls to homebound seniors, supporting small businesses and providing virtual pro bono legal services to low-income individuals. \nAdditionally, AMD has created a special 2:1 employee matching gifts \nprogram to support employees\u2019 charitable donations during the global health crisis.
