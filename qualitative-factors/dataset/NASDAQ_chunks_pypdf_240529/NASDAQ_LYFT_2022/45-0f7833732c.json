{"page_content": "ESG Report 202246\nPolicy progress\nPublic policy is critical in setting the right market conditions and expanding access to EVs and EV \ncharging infrastructure for all communities. Lyft has continued to advocate for policies that will \naccelerate equitable adoption of EVs.\nFederal Policy: In 2021, Lyft joined environmental \njustice groups in advocating for expanding equity-\nfocused EV policies, including modifying the \ncurrent federal EV tax incentive and prioritizing \nEV charging infrastructure in underserved and \ndisadvantaged communities. Lyft supported the \nElectric Vehicles for Underserved Communities Act \n(H.R. 1221), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs \nAct (H.R.3684 ), as well as the EV provisions of the \nInflation Reduction Act.\nCalifornia: Lyft advocated for aggressive targets \nin the CA Clean Miles Standard rulemaking \nprocess and supported the California Air Resources \nBoard (CARB)\u2019s final rules, which CARB approved \nin 2021. The final CARB regulations will lead \nTNCs to achieve 0 grams of carbon emissions \nper passenger-mile traveled by 2030. Lyft also \npartnered with environmental, labor, and business \ngroups to launch the Clean Air California Coalition \nto support the Clean Cars, Clean Air Act initiative in \nthe 2022 election, which would curb the state\u2019s two \nbiggest sources of air pollution and greenhouse \ngas emissions: transportation and wildfires.\nColorado: Lyft supported S.B. 260 , which Gov. Polis  \nsigned into law in June 2021. S.B. 260 will direct \nmillions of dollars each year toward EV affordability \nand accessibility, in part through TNC fees.Massachusetts: From October 2020 to April \n2021, Lyft participated in Massachusetts\u2019 \nRide for Hire Electrification Working Group, \nwhich included members of state agencies, \nenvironmental groups, utilities, taxi and livery \nindustries, and the private sector. Through \nrobust discussions, this group developed a set of \nnear- and long-term policy recommendations  \nto increase the adoption of EVs. Two of the \nhighest-priority recommendations were to \nestablish stand-alone or additional EV rebates \nfor: (1) qualified high-mileage fleet operators \nand drivers and (2) low- to moderate-income \ndrivers. We look forward to working with state \npolicymakers to advance these and other \nrecommendations.\nOregon: We supported S.B. 1558, a bill that \nwould require full electrification of vehicles on \nour platform by 2032. This innovative bill built \nupon lessons from California\u2019s Clean Miles \nStandard and Incentive Program.\nWashington: We supported H.B. 1075 , which, \nsimilar to the California Clean Miles Standard, \nwould regulate TNC emissions on a greenhouse-\ngas-per-passenger-mile-traveled basis.Hybrid-electric vehicles\nHigh-efficiency hybrid-electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles on the Lyft platform. In 2021, \nnearly 13% of all Lyft miles were provided by hybrids, as well as 50% of Express Drive rides. By the end \nof the year, hybrids comprised almost 40% of vehicles in the Express Drive program. Going forward, \nwe expect the vast majority of Flexdrive vehicles in the Express Drive program to be EVs or hybrids.ESG Report 2022", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LYFT_2022.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
