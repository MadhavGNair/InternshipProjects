Last year, we embarked on a bold multi-year \njourney to help improve some of the world\u2019s \nacute conditions and help address climate \nchange, which poses a serious threat to  \nbusiness and society globally. Our new  \nsustainability and social impact platform,  \nServe 360: Doing Good in Every Direction, is \nguiding the company\u2019s efforts and delivering \npositive results through four priority areas,  \nor what we call our \u201ccoordinates\u201d: \n\u2022 Nurture Our World \u2013 Advancing the  \nresiliency and development of our  \ncommunities. \n\u2022 Sustain Responsible Operations \u2013  \nReducing the company's environmental \nimpacts, sourcing responsibly and building \nand operating sustainable hotels. \n\u2022 Empower Through Opportunity \u2013 Helping \npeople explore opportunity in the hospitality \nindustry.\n\u2022 Welcome All & Advance Human Rights \u2013\nCreating a safe and welcoming environment \nfor our associates and travelers alike. \nIn this Report, I invite you to learn more about \nServe 360 and our strategies, programs and \nfuture plans to meet the ambitious goals  \nwe\u2019ve set. We are pleased to share, for the first \ntime, our collective progress against our 2025 \nSustainability and Social Impact Goals across \neach of our four Serve 360 coordinates.A few of the things I\u2019m most excited about \ninclude initiatives we began work on in 2017. \nOne of them is our plan to remove disposable \nplastic straws and stirrers from our more than \n6,500 properties across 30 brands around \nthe world by July 2019 \u2014 a decision that could \neliminate more than 1 billion plastic straws a \nyear. We also decided to reduce waste by  \nreplacing small toiletry bottles in the guest-\nroom showers at more than 1,500 hotels in \nNorth America by the end of 2018 with larger, \npump-topped bottles. Additionally in 2017, \nwe trained more than 240,000 associates on \nhuman trafficking awareness.\nAt Marriott, we like to say that success is never \nfinal. Indeed, our work here will be ongoing \nas we adapt to the needs of our world. I am \nproud of the progress we have already made, \nand I look forward to us continuing to do good \nin every direction.\n \n \nArne Sorenson\nPresident and CEO of  \nMarriott International, Inc.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2018.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
