Guests are able to enjoy views of Kigali's sprawling \nhills and valleys, explore nearby national parks. \nThis luxury hotel has created more than 500 jobs in Rwanda. \nWe partnered with the Akilah Institute, a Kigali-based wom-\nen\u2019s college, to recruit and train potential candidates, some \nof whom prepared by interning at Marriott properties in the \nMiddle East. Marriott has also been working with local philan-\nthropies to equip Rwandan women with the needed skills to \napply for entry-level hotel positions or to supply the hotel with \nitems like baskets, cheese, and honey. \nThe Kigali Marriott Hotel manages an internal development \nprogram that aims to transfer skills from longtime Marriott \nassociates from abroad to local employees, approximately \n89% of whom are Rwandan nationals. Forty-one percent \nof the hotel\u2019s employees and 53% of the hotel\u2019s managers \nare women. The hotel also participates in country-wide and \ninternational activities in cooperation with the Rwanda De-\nvelopment Board to promote the country as a destination.Global Diversity and Inclusion\nAbove: An Akiliah Institute student prepares desserts at the  \nKigali Marriott Hotel in Kigali, Rwanda. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2018.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
