Our team of nurses provides on-site care at properties and telephonic care for  \nassociates. They also assist with case management.\nLife and Health Coaching: Marriott medical plan participants have access to free personalized health \ncoaching by phone. Additionally, more than 50 properties across the U.S. and corporate headquarters \nhave on-site health coaches who offer in-person counseling to help associates stay on track with their \nphysical and emotional wellbeing. \nMany of Marriott\u2019s largest hotels and offices have on-site health coaches who are employed by the  \nmedical plan offered in the area. They offer personal coaching sessions, on-site health education  \nsessions and sponsor group health activities. Coaches also help connect associates with health plan \nnurses for condition and disease management. About 12% of all U.S. associates have access to an  \non-site health coach. During 2018, this program will be expanded with an on-site health concierge pilot.\nTakeCare: In 2010, we created TakeCare for our associates as a primary focus of Marriott\u2019s healthcare  \nstrategy.
