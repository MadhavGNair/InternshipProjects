With people now working from home, we had to pivot in \nour delivery process. We innovated with virtual delivery, using a mixture of \ncollaborative tools to deliver online training for our leadership team across \nthe globe. Our tech-savvy employee base helped us to deploy this training \neffectively, combined with our prior experience in video conferencing.\nWe will build on our success with this program by delivering a more in-depth \ninclusive leadership program, spanning at least one day, to executives and their \ndirect reports to help enhance awareness and drive diversity through  \nthe leadership team.\nEnhancing recruitment practices \nAnother 2020 goal involved enhancing our attraction, recruitment, and selection \n(ARS) practices with inclusivity training. We spent 2020 adapting our training \nplan to support virtual delivery, and we plan to deliver this during 2021. We\nalso implemented a new applicant tracking system to ensure a more equitable \nrecruitment process.\nEmerging Professionals employee resource group \nWe are committed to building structured career paths that nurture new entrants \nto our workforce and provide equal opportunities for all genders and races.
