Our people-driven \nsustainability effort faced many challenges in 2020, not least because so many \nemployees transitioned to working from home. We were forced to defer some \nof our 2020 commitments as we focused on the pandemic.\nIn spite of 2020\u2019s challenges, we are proud to report some key wins in areas \nincluding diversity and employee well-being. We continue to enhance and \nexpand the status of women at Sierra Wireless, especially in senior management \npositions. This continues to be a focus for our CEO, who has been vocal in his \nsupport for a more diverse workforce with greater opportunities for all.\nThe Sierra Wireless Five-Pillar D&I StrategyLisa Blackham,\nSenior Director, Human Resources, North America, \nand Inclusion & Diversity Program Lead\nEvolve our \nD&I cultureHire more diverse candidates \nwithin our pipeline Recognize, promote, \nand compensate fairlyDevelop a more diverse \nleadership-succession pipeline Champion D&I \nin our community\n15", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SWIR_2020.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
