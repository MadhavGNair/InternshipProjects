FOCUSING ON  \nSUSTAINABLE PACKAGING\nAs a key pillar of our sustainability \nstrategy, we aim to create zero \nnet waste packaging and to form \ninnovative partnerships to improve \nrecycling infrastructure globally. To \nthis end, we want to design 100% \nof our packaging to be recycled, \ncontribute to improvements and \nadvancements in waste management \ninfrastructure, reduce the amount of \nvirgin material used and stimulate \na change in consumer behavior by \nproviding more recycling information \non pack for consumers. \nDESIGNING FOR RECYCLABILITY\nA key goal is to have all our packaging designed \nto be recyclable by 2025. We are well on the \nway with this \u2013 achieving 94% in 2020. \nAll our paper and carton board, and some rigid \nplastics and flexible plastic films are already \ndesigned to be recycled. \nREDUCING PACKAGING\nWe achieved ten months ahead of schedule \nour\u00a02020 goal of taking action to reduce \npackaging materials by 65,000 tons since 2012. \nYear-on-year, we reduced packaging by 4,100 \ntons. Our\u00a0actual reduction over these 8 years \nwas over 68,000 tons.OUR PACKAGING MIX\nThe chart below shows the amount and mix of \npackaging we used in 2020 (metric tons):\nRigid Plastics 49,000 5.4%\nFlexible Plastics 140,500 15.6%\nCorrugated 410,500 45.5%\nPaper 277,000 30.7%\nGlass 15,500 1.7%\nMetals 10,000 1.1%\nTotal 902,500\nAs the chart shows, the great majority of our \npackaging, around 79%, is non-plastic. There \nare relatively well-developed recycling markets \naround the world for this packaging. \nWithin the remaining 21% of our packaging, \nwhich is plastic, about 75% is lightweight \nflexible packaging. This packaging works well \nto protect our products for our consumers, \nkeeping it safe and fresh for longer. It also \nreduces shipping costs and CO\u2082 emissions from \ntransportation due to its relative light weight. \nIndeed, only 5% of our total CO\u2082 emissions \ncome from packaging.\nHowever, lightweight flexible packaging creates \nenvironmental challenges as collection and \nrecycling are underdeveloped in most countries. \nAs a result, only 2% of our plastic packaging is \ncurrently recycled. We\u2019re working on this.\nWe set a virgin plastic reduction target for \n2025 that will result in a 5% absolute reduction \nin virgin plastic use in overall plastic packaging \nrelative to 2020, including a 25% cut in virgin \nplastic in its rigid plastic packaging. These \nactions are expected to result in a 10,000  \nton reduction of virgin plastic packaging in  \nfive years.TACKLING THE PLASTICS CHALLENGES\nThe challenges around plastics involve process, \npolicy and perception. Flexible plastics films are \ndifficult to collect, sort and reprocess because \nthey are lightweight in nature and formed \nfrom multiple different materials. In addition, \nthere is a lack of adequate, harmonized policy \nframeworks and incentives for profitable \ninvestment in infrastructure for the collection, \nsorting and reprocessing of flexible plastics. \nAnd consumers are confused about recycling \nflexible plastic films, even where the \ninfrastructure to collect and recycle them is  \nin place.\nOur sustainable packaging strategy proactively \ntackles the challenges in three key ways:\nINNOVATE\nWe aim to innovate in designing packaging \nto be recycled, as well as optimizing packs \nto reduce excess packaging. This includes \neliminating unnecessary plastic where climate \nchange impact is favorable while delivering \nproduct safety and quality. \n2025 goal: 100% packaging designed to be recycled\nENABLE\nWe aim to enable the recycling of materials, \nparticularly flexibles, by improving the \ninfrastructure for collection and recycling. \nWe are, for example, investing in waste \nmanagement and increasing post-consumer \nrecycled material in our plastic packaging. \n2025 goal: 5% recycled content in our plastic \npackaging\nENGAGE\nWe are advocating for sound policy and take a \nleading position in on-pack communication for \nrecycling relevant to consumers\u2019 local context. \nTo this end, we support local and global plastics \npacts and treaties to inform effective policy \nframeworks and placing guidance on pack.\n2025 goal: recycling labeling on all packs2017 2018 2019 2020\nPackaging \nmaterials \neliminated \nvs 2013 \n(metric tons)53,500 59,600 64,850 68,000\nPackaging \ndesigned to \nbe recycledNA 92.5% 93% 94%\nPaper-based \npackaging \nsustainably \nsourced75% 90% 100% 100%\nReference page 10 of this report for baseline figures\n36\n36\nMONDEL \u0112Z INTERNATIONAL  SNACKING MADE RIGHT 2020 ESG REPORTRight Moment Performance Right Snack Right Way Sustainable Ingredients Governance\nOverview Landscape  \n& InsightsDiversity, Equity \n& Inclusion Workplace \nsafetyWorkplace  \nwellnessHuman  \nrightsClimate Energy Packaging Waste Water", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2020.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
