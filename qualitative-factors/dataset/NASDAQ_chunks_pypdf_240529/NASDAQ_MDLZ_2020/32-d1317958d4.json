Our 2018 \nHuman Rights Report identified them as salient \nhuman risks in our value chain. They are the \nconsequence of several complex socioeconomic \nchallenges and we are taking a stand and \naddressing them through our sustainable \ncocoa sourcing program Cocoa Life, our Palm \nOil Action Plan, and collective action within the \nInternational Cocoa Initiative and the Consumer \nGoods Forum. \nADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES \nCocoa Life\u2019s holistic approach addresses child \nlabor\u2019s root causes through interventions \nto increase income, empower communities \nto advocate for their development, and the \nempowerment of women at household and \ncommunity level. \nThrough Cocoa Life, we train communities on \nchild protection issues and monitor conditions \nto identify high risk farms or communities. \nWe\u2019re also leading the response across our \ncocoa-growing communities by establishing \nand training Child Protection Committees \nwithin communities, and working with schools \nand district authorities. MONITORING & REMEDIATION \nIn West Africa, to respond to the relatively \nhigh level of risk, we are rolling out CLMRS \n(Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation \nSystems) and our goal is to have all Cocoa Life \ncommunities in West Africa covered by 2025. \nIn Indonesia, where the risk is relatively low, we \nare focusing on interventions so that children \nwho do work in cocoa outside of school hours \ndo not engage in any tasks deemed hazardous.\nCOLLABORATING ACROSS THE SECTOR \nTo achieve widespread change across \nwhole supply chains, we collaborate with \npeer companies, expert organizations and \ngovernments. As a board member of the \nInternational Cocoa Initiative (ICI) for example, \nwe work collaboratively with our peers, \nsuppliers and civil society organizations to \naddress both child and forced labor in the \ncocoa supply chain, and drive efforts to \nstrengthen public-private partnership with the \ngovernments of Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. As a board member of the Consumer Goods \nForum (CGF) we work collaboratively to help \neradicate forced labor. We support CGF\u2019s \nPriority Industry Principles on Forced Labor. \nIn addition, we co-chair CGF\u2019s Forest Positive \nCoalition of Action and the Palm Oil Working \nGroup, and are members of the Human Rights \nCoalition of Action. \nRESPECTING RIGHTS THROUGHOUT  \nSUPPLY CHAINS \nThrough our Palm Oil Action Plan (POAP), we \nrequire suppliers to respect the labor rights \nof all workers and embed the CGF Priority \nIndustry Principles against Forced Labor within \nboth their own operations and their supply \nchains. The POAP requires suppliers to provide \nannual assurance of continuous improvement, \nverified by third party labor rights experts. \nSUPPORTING MANDATORY DUE DILIGENCE \nRecognizing the need for everyone involved to \nwork together to tackle human rights issues \nin global supply chains, we support legislative \nefforts to enable practical, proactive, ongoing \nhuman rights due diligence. \nGOAL PROGRESS\nOur goal is 100% CLMRS coverage in West \nAfrica by 2025. As of the end of 2020, \nwe have coverage across 28% of total \ncommunities in West Africa.Cocoa: \n\u2022  Commitment to 100% coverage of Cocoa \nLife communities in West Africa with Child \nLabor Monitoring & Remediation Systems \n(CLMRS) by 2025\n\u2022  Ongoing International Cocoa Initiative pilot \non forced labor, to also address adult forced \nlabor risk \nPalm oil: \n\u2022  Continued engagement with suppliers on \nour Palm Oil Action Plan, to support the \ntransition to sustainable practices \n\u2022  Collaborative action through the \nConsumer Goods Forum, driving industry \nimprovements in palm oil sourcing COCOA AND PALM OIL\nReference page 10 of this report for baseline figures\n33\n33\nMONDEL \u0112Z INTERNATIONAL  SNACKING MADE RIGHT 2020 ESG REPORTRight Moment Performance Right Snack Right Way Sustainable Ingredients Governance\nOverview Landscape  \n& InsightsDiversity, Equity \n& Inclusion Workplace \nsafetyWorkplace  \nwellnessHuman  \nrightsClimate Energy Packaging Waste Water", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2020.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
