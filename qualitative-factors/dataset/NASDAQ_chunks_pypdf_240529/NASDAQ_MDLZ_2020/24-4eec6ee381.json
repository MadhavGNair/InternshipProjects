{"page_content": "GLOBAL CASE STUDY\nHELPING TO BUILD HEALTHY RESILIENT  \nCOMMUNITIES IN SOUTH AFRICA\nWe aim to build healthy and resilient communities in our \nlocal communities through new impact investments. In South \nAfrica, we are focusing on the challenges surrounding many \ncommunities, with a focus on climate change, racial injustice  \nand food security. As part of our Sustainable Futures \nengagement we are concentrating on seed investment in social \nenterprises to deliver lasting positive social and environmental \nimpact to and help marginalized people. \nSustainable Futures is helping finance the Aquaponics Social \nEnterprise (ASE). An innovative new enterprise aiming to deliver \nmore lasting and self-sustainable social impact, ASE combines \nfish farming in aquacultures together with hydroponics \nfor soilless crop production, as a climate-smart agriculture process. By using less space, water and energy, ASE is helping \nhistorically disadvantaged populations in South Africa progress \nfrom subsistence to commercial agriculture production, with \nsustainable income opportunities and access to nutritious  \nfood. Together with INMED, we are a founding investor in ASE, \nhave representation on the company\u2019s board and are committed \nto continue supporting through financial support and skill-\nbased volunteering.\nOur first impact investment pilot, ASE is set to positively  \nimpact 90,000 people, create over 270 jobs and educate more \nthan 18,000 people over the next three years.IMPacT  \nInveSTIng\nIMPACT INVESTMENT THROUGH \nSUSTAINABLE FUTURES\nTo do more for the greater \ngood requires new ways \nof thinking and working \nfor positive, long-lasting \nimpact on people and the planet.\nThat\u2019s why in 2020 we created Sustainable \nFutures, an Impact Investment platform \ndesigned to address today\u2019s most complex \nchallenges such as climate change,  \npackaging, waste and recycling, and build \nresilient communities. \nSustainable Futures incubates and finances \ninnovative social investments and partnerships \nthat amplify our positive impact and create a \nfuture where people and planet thrive.\nThe Sustainable Futures investment strategy \nconsists of two key pillars:\n\u2022  Contributing to impact-focused funds that \ninvest in sustainability initiatives \n\u2022  Working with our business and partners \non the ground to find, fund and scale local \nenterprises that have created unique solutions \nto global challenges\nThe Mondel\u0113z International Foundation (MIF) \ncontinues to support communities in time \nof need by providing disaster relief to the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross \n(ICRC) and other partners.\n25\nMONDEL \u0112Z INTERNATIONAL  SNACKING MADE RIGHT 2020 ESG REPORT\nRight Moment Performance Right Snack Right Way Sustainable Ingredients Governance\nOverview Landscape  \n& InsightsMindful  \nsnackingPortion  \ncontrolLabeling  \n& MarketingNutrition \npartnershipsMaking a difference \nwhere it countsCommunity \nImpactImpact  \ninvesting", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2020.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
