{"page_content": "STRONG COMMITMENT AND GOVERNANCE \nWe follow the United Nations Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights as a \nframework to guide our approach to identify \nand address risks, and to disclose our progress. \nFor more information, please see our  \n2019 Human Rights Report. \nOur Human Rights Working Group defines our \nhuman rights due diligence strategy and drives its \nimplementation throughout our organization. The \nBoard has ultimate accountability for governance. \nBusiness units manage human rights issues \nin operations and with local suppliers; global \nfunctions manage them across supply chains. \nWe work with a range of expert external advisors \nto help us assess and strengthen our approach, \nincluding TwentyFifty, Embode and our Cocoa Life \nExternal Advisory Board.\nSPEAKING UP AND INVESTIGATING \nIn line with our worldwide Speaking Up \nand Investigations Policy, employees and \nexternal stakeholders can confidentially, and \nanonymously if they wish, report issues through \nthe HelpLine and WebLine. Our policy includes \nzero tolerance for retaliation. Management \nAction Plans (MAP) are established to address \nany gaps or weaknesses identified in the course \nof investigations. MANAGING RISK IN OUR OWN OPERATIONS \nTo identify potential human rights issues and \nmonitor compliance with our policies, we use \nthe Sedex Member Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) \nprotocol to evaluate our internal manufacturing \nsites against a common set of corporate social \nresponsibility standards developed for the \nconsumer goods industry. \nWORKING WITH SUPPLIERS \nWe expect our suppliers to follow our Corporate \nResponsibility Guidelines, including \u2018to endeavor \nto provide safe working conditions.\u2019 We also ask \nprioritized suppliers to undergo SMETA audits \nto support the identification of potential human \nrights risks and help guide our approach for \nimpact mitigation and monitoring. \nWe have increased our focus on supply chain \ntransparency, including publishing a list of \npalm oil mills in our upstream supply chain and \nproviding an online overview of the locations of \nCocoa Life registered farms. \nIn the 2020 update of the Palm Oil Action Plan, \nwe strengthened our supplier expectations on \nhuman rights. This included spelling out the due \ndiligence steps we expect our palm oil suppliers \nto follow in order to identify and mitigate risks \nin their own operations and supply chain, in \nline with the framework of the UN Guiding \nPrinciples on Business & Human Rights and our \nown commitment to respect the rights of people \nacross the value chain.\nBUILDING AWARENESS AND CAPACITY \nWe are strengthening human rights due \ndiligence systems and have prioritized key \nrisks, including forced labor across our own \noperations and supply chain. \nIn 2019, we carried out extensive Human \nRights Impact Assessments in two of our \nmanufacturing plants in Thailand and Malaysia. \nThe assessments allowed us to better \nevaluate our exposure, identify opportunities \nto strengthen our practices globally and \nimplement improvements. \nhuMan \nRIghTS\n2017 2018 2019 2020\nPrioritized \nsuppliers audited 330 248 338 257\n\u2022  We met our targets on audits of our own \nplants; 100% of our manufacturing sites \nwere independently audited following a \nthree-year cycle, using the SMETA protocol, \nwhich includes forced labor risk indicators\n\u2022  We met our targets on audits of prioritized \ntier 1 supplier; 100% of 2020's highest \npriority suppliers completed a SMETA audit\n\u2022  We conducted comprehensive Human \nRights Impact Assessments in plants \nlocated in high risk geographies in 2020, \nand are working on integrating the \nlearnings into our global practices in 2021HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESSWe are committed to doing \nbusiness the right way and to \nrespecting human rights.\nRESEARCHING HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS  \nAND RECOMMENDING IMPROVEMENTS\nIn 2020 we co-commissioned a report offering \nan independent assessment of the issue of \nmigrant labor in the palm oil sector in Malaysia. \nThe study was conducted by the human rights \nconsultancy Embode. The report \u2018The Road to \nWorthy Work and Valuable Labour\u2019 is publicly \navailable on Embode\u2019s website.\nOur collective goals in commissioning the \nreport were to assess the extent of human \nrights risks among migrant laborers in this \nsector, and obtain informed, credible, and \nspecific recommendations on how to address \nany such risks.\nWe discovered a number of things through \nthe on-the-ground research: the situation \nof migrant workers in Malaysia is an issue \nof significant concern; the labor issues on \nMalaysian palm plantations are complex, \ndriven by economic and socio-political \ndynamics; Malaysia is an economy where there \nis demand for cheap, low-skilled labor, which \npoorer countries in the region are providing; \nrisk of exploitation arises because migrant \nlaborers are not well represented and often \ndon\u2019t fully understand their rights.\nKey actions recommended to improve  \nthe situation included advancing public-\nprivate platforms and collective action to \naddress the situation surrounding migrant \nworkers in\u00a0Malaysia, promoting greater \nrepresentation formigrant workers in \nMalaysia, and encouraging stakeholders to \nbetter protect and resource migrant workers \nby improving worker protection services and \ncomplaints mechanisms.\nWe are also continuing our active \nparticipation in the Consumer Goods Forum \nPalm Oil & Human Rights working groups.  \nWe will continue our focus on compliance \nand due diligence.\u201c What we discovered through our \non-the-ground research is that \nthe situation of migrant workers in \nMalaysia is of significant concern. \nMigrant workers are not adequately \nrepresented and their voices need to be \nbetter heard. We need more collective \naction by governments industry, and \nNGOs, building on industry efforts \nmade to improve worker standards \nand in full consultation with migrant \nworkers themselves.\u201dGLOBAL CASE STUDY\nAarti Kapoor,  \nExecutive Director,  \nEmbode\nReference page 10 of this report for baseline figures\n32\n32\nMONDEL \u0112Z INTERNATIONAL  SNACKING MADE RIGHT 2020 ESG REPORTRight Moment Performance Right Snack Right Way Sustainable Ingredients Governance\nOverview Landscape  \n& InsightsDiversity, Equity \n& Inclusion Workplace \nsafetyWorkplace  \nwellnessHuman  \nrightsClimate Energy Packaging Waste Water", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2020.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
