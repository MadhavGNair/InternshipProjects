Individually \nwrapped products enable people to \nenjoy the treats they love, become \nmore mindful when they eat, and help \nmanage their calories.\nWe are committed to growing our portion \ncontrol products to 20% of our global snacks \nnet revenue by 2025. In 2018, we achieved our \n2020 target of 15% and increased it to 16% in \n2019. We maintained this 16% level in 2020, as \nthe pandemic slowed overall portion control \ngrowth, to 1%, and affected consumer demand \nin different ways across chocolate, biscuits \nand candy. Portion control in chocolate grew \n10% year-on-year in 2020 to 15.5% of snacks \nnet revenue, while biscuits decreased 6% to \n18%. Overall, our portion control offerings as \na percentage of our snacks net revenue have \nrisen from ~10% in 2012 to 16% in 2020. Looking ahead, we are committed to driving our \nportion control growth more actively to meet \nour 2025 target.\nIn 2020 we committed to bring all of our \nCadbury chocolate bars sold as part of a \nmultipack under 200 calories by the end of \n2021. This move will see over 2 billion calories \nremoved from the UK market each year. It \nbuilds on our pledge to bring all Cadbury \nchocolate and biscuit products typically bought \nby parents for children to under 100 calories by \nthe end of 2020. The much-loved Cadbury bars, \nFudge, Curly Wurly and Chomp, as well as Barny \nSponge Bears and Cadbury Mini Fingers and \nCadbury Animals are now all under 100 calories.We are mindful of balancing our growth in \nportion control with our commitment to \nreducing waste and plastic packaging.
