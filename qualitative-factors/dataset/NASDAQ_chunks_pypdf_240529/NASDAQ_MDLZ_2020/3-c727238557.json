Through this \napproach we are able to achieve significant, \nbusiness-impacting results.\nClear long-term goals, measurable progress \nand transparency are vital to building trust \nwith our stakeholders, and this trust must \nbe earned through action and maintained \nthrough enhanced disclosure and dialogue. \nOur consumers, our customers, our colleagues, \nand our investors want to support a company \nthey trust and that\u2019s why ESG is woven into the \nfabric of our business. \nLaura: What were you particularly proud of \nlast year, and what do you want to continue \nto accomplish?\nChris: I am incredibly proud of our teams, \nwhose work led us to exceed our 2020 \nSnacking Made Right goals in key areas like CO\u2082, \nwater and waste reduction.
