We have now been on the ground \nfor nine years and well on track to deliver this \ncommitment, reaching more than 188,000 \nfarmers and more than 2,100 communities \nby 2020. In 2020, we invested $31 million in \nimplementing the Cocoa Life program and \n$46.3 million for Cocoa Life premiums to farmer \norganizations and their farmers.\nGOING BEYOND CERTIFICATION\nOur mission is to lead the transformation of \nthe cocoa sector. We work on the ground to \ncreate this transformation by moving beyond \ncomplying to standards and investing directly \non the ground, where change is most needed. We set Cocoa Life up as an independent \nverification program to ensure we are \naccountable for the sustainability of the cocoa \nwe use. Working with external experts, we \nverify that the benefits of our program are \nreaching farmers and their families. \nLEARNING THROUGH IMPACT \nMaking cocoa right is only possible through  \nin-depth impact measurement against clear \nKPIs, and we have years of experience of this  \nso we can share learnings and better address \nthe challenges.\nTo help us keep learning and improving, we \nengage two independent third-parties, Ipsos \nand FLOCERT, to measure and verify that we are \naccomplishing what we set out to do. PARTNERING FOR LASTING CHANGE\nWe believe partnership is key to lasting  \nchange. So we work closely with the  \npeople on the ground and engage in public-\nprivate collaboration.\nBEING HOLISTIC\nWe know how important it is to take a holistic \nview and look for interconnected solutions, \nrather than fixing one problem in isolation only \nto create another.\nLIVING INCOME DIFFERENTIAL\nMondel\u0113z International also endorses the \nproducing governments\u2019 initiatives and  \nfully embraced the Living Income Differential \nfor all the cocoa we source from Ghana and \nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire, paying the full increase of 400 \nUSD per tonne.TOGETHER, WE MAKE COCOA RIGHT \nWe are passionate about chocolate. We \nchannel that passion for maximum positive \nimpact through Cocoa Life, our global cocoa \nsustainability program designed to ensure \ncocoa is made right and safeguard a sustainable \nfuture for this essential ingredient. Through \nCocoa Life we tackle the complex challenges \nthat cocoa farmers and their communities face, \nwe focus our efforts on solutions to address \nthe interwoven root causes, the challenges \nthat threaten a sustainable supply. We enable \nand empower the farmers and communities we \npartner with to drive their own development \nand work in partnership across the public \nand private sectors to innovate and invest in \nsolutions that improve the economics of cocoa \nfarming. We do this across six cocoa-growing \ncountries: Ghana, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Indonesia, \nDominican Republic, India and Brazil.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2020.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
