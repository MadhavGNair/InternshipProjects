{"page_content": "We have continued our focus on reducing \nour CO\u2082 emissions from manufacturing. This \nincludes improving energy management \nsystems and investing in energy efficient \ntechnologies in our factories. We are also \nusing low-carbon renewable energy sources \nto reduce our CO\u2082 emissions.\nIMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY\nIn 2020, we succeeded in improving our overall \nenergy efficiency by 9%, leading to a total 117,000 tons \nreduction in CO\u2082 emissions in our manufacturing plants. \nAs an example, at our BIMO plant we saved four hours \nof gas use by synchronizing oven pre-heats and dough \ncrossing. This resulted in a reduction of 813 tons of CO\u2082v \nand a total saving of $100,000. REDUCING CO \u2082 EMISSIONS BY INCREASING OUR \nUSE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY\nThrough the year, we significantly increased our use of \nrenewable energy, from 8% to 23% of total energy used. \nThis increase played a key part in enabling us to achieve \na big reduction in CO\u2082 emissions \u2013 by 147,109 tons, from \n1,336,793 tons in 2019 to 1,189,684 tons in 2020. The \nannual reduction in CO\u2082 is equivalent to taking 31,993 \ncars off the road for a year.\n\u2022  Our Mexican manufacturing plants now use 100% \nrenewable energy from wind farm plants. This equates \nto 33,000 less tons of CO\u2082.\n\u2022  In Australia, we have signed a ten-year agreement to \nsource 100% renewable electricity for our Victorian \nmanufacturing sites, reducing our Australia and New \nZealand carbon emissions by 50% \u2013 34,217 tons over 10 \nyears (after verification).eneRgy\nWe continue to focus on reducing our \nenergy consumption as part of our ongoing \ncommitment to reduce our CO\u2082 emissions.\n2017 2018 2019 2020\nManufacturing Scope \n1+2 CO\u2082 emissions from \nenergy(CO\u2082e Metric \nTon \u2013 market-based)1,494,340 1,404,481 1,336,793 1,189,684\nTotal energy used  \n(GJ/ton)3.68 3.64 3.61 3.45 \nTotal electricity used \n(GJ/ton)1.34 1.34 1.27 1.31\nTotal natural gas used \n(GJ/ton)2.03 2.07 2.03 1.96\nTotal renewables used \n(%)6% 6% 8% 23%\nGOAL PROGRESS\nIn 2020, we exceeded our goal to reduce carbon \nemissions across our manufacturing operations by 15%, \ncompared to 2013 \u2013 achieving a 24% reduction.\nReference page 10 of this report for baseline figures\n35\n35\nMONDEL \u0112Z INTERNATIONAL  SNACKING MADE RIGHT 2020 ESG REPORTRight Moment Performance Right Snack Right Way Sustainable Ingredients Governance\nOverview Landscape  \n& InsightsDiversity, Equity \n& Inclusion Workplace \nsafetyWorkplace  \nwellnessHuman  \nrightsClimate Energy Packaging Waste Water\nENERGY PROGRESS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2020.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
