The aim of the mental health competition was to \nfind new ideas and create healthy spaces in schools for students \nand teachers alike. Students and families were encouraged to do \nphysical activity at home together and to post updates on social \nmedia. Several hundred participants took part in the challenge, \nwhich had a very positive effect on them.HELPING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES LIVE WELL TOGETHER \nIN MEXICO\nSave the Children Mexico designed a digital strategy to address \nthe comprehensive needs children face during quarantine. \nDelivering their program virtually reduced delivery costs, and \nenabled them to reach more schools and benefit a greater \nnumber of children than originally targeted. \nThe program focused on addressing physical activity, healthy \neating, COVID-19 knowledge, personal hygiene and general \nhealth promotion, as well as offering psychosocial support and \nmental health. \nThe aim was to help improve practices that bring children and \ntheir family\u2019s comprehensive well-being, and above all, allow \nthem to explore new ways of living together that promote \nhealth at home and in the family.coMMunIT y \nIMPacT\nGOAL PROGRESS\nIn 2020, 100% of the $50 million \ncommitment was allocated to programs.COMMUNITY IMPACT\nPROGRESS*We continue to partner with leading \ncommunity organizations to transform the \nlives of children around the world and fund \ndisaster relief efforts.
