{"page_content": "10 CEO Letter Environmental Social Governance Appendix About ACI SustainabilityEnergy Improvements  \nAre Making an  \nImmediate Impact\nEfficient energy use is important to ACI and our customers as it impacts our business costs \nas well as our carbon footprint. We recently began tracking electricity usage in our data \ncenters and will analyze this data to see how we can be more efficient. In addition, in 2020, \nwe completed an office optimization initiative that reduced our global office footprint by \napproximately 20%. Conservation is a management priority, and we have already made \nimportant steps to improve efficiency and expect to provide more details on our progress in \nfuture disclosures.\n1/2 Lighting Electrical Load\nACI recently converted its U.S. and Indian offices from fluorescent and T-8/T-12 \nto LED lighting. The switch to LED lighting has already produced positive energy \nsavings and will continue to do so in the future. By converting to LED lighting, ACI \ncut its lighting electrical load roughly in half.\nLower HVAC Energy Costs\nACI utilizes building management systems to control HVAC where possible. \nWe have limited the usage of air conditioning, depending on the occupancy \nof a particular office area. These efforts resulted in both decreased energy \nconsumption and lower energy costs. HVAC efficiency initiatives in our Pune, \nIndia office alone resulted in annual energy savings of approximately $27,000 USD.\nClimate Resiliency Strategy\nACI Worldwide has data centers dispersed globally that help mitigate risks such as those \nassociated with natural disasters. Our infrastructure is positioned operationally to minimize \nconcentration risk.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACIW_2021.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
