{"page_content": "19 CEO Letter Social Governance Appendix About ACI Sustainability EnvironmentalEmployee Health and \nWell-Being \nRetirement and Financial Benefits\nACI believes in helping employees save for the future. Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan \n(ESPP) is available globally, with a few country exceptions, and is accessible no matter the \nemployee\u2019s level in the company. Employees can elect to deduct 1 to 10 percent of eligible \ncompensation to purchase ESPP shares at a discounted price. \nIn the U.S., we offer a 401(k) retirement savings plan to full-time, part-time and temporary \nemployees. Employees can elect to contribute 1 to 75 percent of eligible compensation to their \n401(k). ACI matches 100% of the first 4% an employee contributes and matches 50% of the \nnext 4% an employee contributes, up to a cap of $5,000.\nIn the U.K., we offer a pension plan and perk program. The latter offers discounts on retail \npurchases and leisure activities.\nCOVID-19 Benefits\nIn 2021, in response to the COVID-19 crisis in India, ACI took extraordinary action to boost \nbenefits for India employees. New hires in the country gained advance access to their entire \nannual leave balance. All India employees were permitted to use their volunteer hours to care \nfor loved ones impacted by COVID. ACI added bereavement leave to existing India benefits, \noffering three days paid leave for those who experience the loss of a family member. India team \nmembers who exhaust their leave balance due to COVID can also receive a grant of additional \nleave. In addition, ACI made Employee Hardship Assistance available to India employees \nand their immediate family members who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19 and have \nexceeded the sum insured under our insurance policy.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACIW_2021.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
