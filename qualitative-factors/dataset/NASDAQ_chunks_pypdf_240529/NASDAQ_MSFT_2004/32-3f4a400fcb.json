The broad \nrange of courses available include technical cer -\nti\ufb01cations on Microsoft products and develop -\nment of skills such as communications, public \nspeaking, management, and strategic leadership.\nCompensation Philosophy and Practice\nMicrosoft\u2019s compensation philosophy is to  \nprovide all employees with a competitive and \ndistinctive compensation package, and the \nopportunity to earn recognition and additional \nrewards for outstanding performance through \na pay-for-performance approach. Our broad-\nbased compensation program includes: \n\u2022 competitive base salaries \u2014 we pay better than \ntwo-thirds of the companies in the industry;\n\u2022 a broad-based stock awards plan;\n\u2022 a retirement plan for U.S. employees that \ncombines employee contributions with a  \npartial match from Microsoft (not all of our  \nemployee retirement plans in other countries  \ninclude the partial match) ; and \n\u2022 an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)  that \nenables employees to purchase Microsoft \nstock at a substantial discount. \nIn July 2003, we announced our decision to \naward stock grants to all employees, in place \nof stock options, beginning in September 2003. \nThe Stock Award program offers the compa -\nny\u2019s employees the opportunity to earn actual \nshares of Microsoft stock over time, rather than \noptions that give employees the right to pur -\nchase stock at a set price. \nAlso in \ufb01scal year 2004, Microsoft instituted the \nShared Performance Stock Award (SPSA)  pro-\ngram, a long-term incentive program for exec -\nutives and other senior leaders that makes a \nsigni\ufb01cant portion of their stock-based com -\npensation dependent upon the company\u2019s \ngrowth and customer satisfaction over a three-\nyear period. The size of an employee\u2019s SPSA \ngrant depends on competitive long-term com -pensation data, the person\u2019s job, and his or \nher anticipated contribution to Microsoft\u2019s \nlong-term performance.\nIn December 2003, we launched an innovative \nOption Transfer program to enable employees \nto realize some value on portions of their  \nstock options that had not increased in value. \nMicrosoft will make payouts of approximately \n$382 million over three years under  \nthis program.\nEmployee Bene\ufb01ts\nWe offer employees one of the most compre -\nhensive bene\ufb01ts packages in the high-tech \nindustry, which helps us attract and retain the \nbest talent. The bene\ufb01ts discussed in this sec -\ntion are a partial list of the bene\ufb01ts package \nfor U.S. employees. Because bene\ufb01ts for \nMicrosoft employees outside the U.S. often \nvary, and are based on local norms and must \nbe customized to address legal and cultural \ndifferences in other countries and regions, \nsome of the bene\ufb01ts described here apply only \nto Microsoft\u2019s employees based in the U.S.\nHealth bene\ufb01ts include medical, dental, pre -\nscription drugs, vision, disability, life insurance, \n\ufb02exible spending accounts, a group legal net -\nwork, a health club membership subsidy, paid \nvacation and sick leave, and various leaves of \nabsence programs. Employees are able to cus -\ntomize their health bene\ufb01ts package to meet \ntheir individual needs \u2014 there are a variety of \nmedical plans and two dental plans \u2014 and \nhealthcare coverage is also offered to same-\nsex domestic partners.\nMicrosoft offers an adoption assistance plan; \nmatching charitable contributions; tuition  \nassistance; generous maternity and paternity \nleave policies; \ufb02exible work schedules; an \nextensive resource and referral service, includ -\ning Microsoft CARES, an employee assistance  \nprogram that offers counseling for family \nmembers during personal crises; and  \ndiscounted software.
