Microsoft\u2019s standards implementation  \nis focused on customer needs and includes \nimplementation of open standards, de facto \nstandards, product standards, and proprietary \nstandards. A 2003 study by Lawrence  \nAssociates/Forbes found that Windows provides \na 102-percent improvement over competing \nopen source products for standards compliance.\nOpen standards are technical speci\ufb01cations \ndeveloped and maintained, or af\ufb01rmed and \nrati\ufb01ed, by consensus in a market-driven pro -\ncess, in which the technical speci\ufb01cation is (a) \npublicly available to all interested in imple -\nmenting, (b) vendor and product neutral (not \ntied to the services of any particular vendor and \nimplementation is not limited to particular products) , \nand (c) whose patent rights are available to all \nimplementers on at least reasonable and non-\ndiscriminatory (RAND)  terms (either with payment \nof a reasonable royalty or without) . We believe \nthey provide a highly effective way to develop \nplatform-neutral, market-based standards that \neffectively promote interoperability. Microsoft \nhas been actively working with customers, partners, competitors, and governments to \ndevelop standards for several critical technol -\nogy areas. Those efforts include but are not \nlimited to our work on:\n\u2022 E-commerce and Web-based standards  \nfor Web services in organizations such as \nW3C, OASIS, and the Web Services  \nInteroperability Forum\n\u2022 Hardware standards in the PCI Special  \nInterest Group, the Personal Computer \nMemory Card International Association,  \nand the Infrared Data Association\n\u2022 Industry-speci\ufb01c business standards in  \nthe School Interoperability Forum and  \nHealth Level 7\n\u2022 Internet protocol standards in the IETF\n\u2022 Language and runtime environment  \nstandards in the ECMA\nSupply Chain Management \nOur supply chain management philosophy is \nsimple. We believe in working proactively with \nthe most responsible, strongest, and most pro -\nductive suppliers available to deliver value to \nour customers, and we expect them to share \nour corporate values and operating philosophy.\nWe expect our suppliers to operate with the \nsame honesty, integrity, and commitment to \nservice and quality that we demand from our \nemployees. We also expect them to behave \nresponsibly toward the environment, ensure \nworkforce diversity in their own supply chains, \nand provide fair and safe working conditions \nfor their employees. \nTo ensure our suppliers understand the depth \nof our commitment to citizenship and social \nresponsibility, we ask them to read and sign \nour Vendor Code of Conduct, and we monitor \ncode compliance among our top suppliers.\nWe also foster a strong supplier diversity pro -\ngram. Our spending with diverse \ufb01rms in the \nU.S. has grown more than 200 percent over the \npast three years. In addition, we have increased \nthe number and amount of deposits made in For information on our procure -\nment practices and policies, see \nhttp://www.microsoft.com/\nmscorp/procurement/  \nprocess/contracting.asp .\nFor more information on our  \nsupplier diversity program, visit  \nour Web site at  \nhttp://www.microsoft.com/  \nprocurement/diversity .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MSFT_2004.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
