Our people \nbring the Red Robin brand to life, curating \na fun atmosphere for our Guests to enjoy.    \nTeams as Diverse \nas Our Communities\nWe strive to create inclusive environments \n\u2013 spaces where individuals can come as \nthey are. Each Red Robin restaurant is part \nof a unique community, so it\u2019s important \nthat our teams are as diverse as the \nGuests they serve. We are exploring the \nlabor marketplace to identify diverse and \nextraordinary talent. This is a key aspect \nof the start of our diversity, equity and \ninclusion journey. \nInclusive environments run on equitable \nopportunities. In 2021, we launched \nunconscious bias training for leaders in  \nour Restaurant Support Center (RSC),  \nwith plans to roll it out more widely in  \nthe years to come. Keeping Our People Safe\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we \nhave worked tirelessly to protect our people. \nAt the peak of the pandemic, we introduced \na sick pay policy to support Team Members \nwith wage replacement during periods \nof absence. Team Members from our \nRSC also switched to remote working. \nFlexible schedules and hours allowed \nTeam Members to balance the demands \nof their home life, such as childcare, with \nwork responsibilities. \nWe continue to work to create the safest \nenvironments possible, aligning efforts \nwith the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and public health guidance. \npersonal protective equipment (PPE), mask \nguidance, heightened sanitation standards \nand a robust team member health policy \nhave all helped reduce the risk of COVID-19 \ntransmission in our restaurants. \nCompelling Value Propositions \nWhile we already offer competitive pay, \nin 2021, we implemented a compensation \nprogram for all Red Robin positions as part \nof our attractive career path opportunities \nfor Team Members. The program enables \nobjective pay analyses based on skill set \nand experience. Our Global Talent strategy outlines our \ncommitment to develop people from \nwithin. We don\u2019t want this to be \u201cjust a \njob\u201d but instead the key to a career in the \nrestaurant industry. Each of our restaurants \nhas certified learning coaches who \nprepare new Team Members for success \nwith on- the-job training and final skills \ncertification for their position.  \nSupporting Communities\nWe want to give back to the communities \nwe call home. Through a partnership with \nnonprofit Denver Kids Inc., Team Members \nat our RSC pitch in to bring holiday cheer to \nlocal families. Our Team Members donate \ngifts, as well as gift cards for local grocery \nretailers. Over 24 years, Red Robin has \nsupported over 820 families. \nEstablished by Team Members in 2006,  \nthe Red Robin Giving Fund was created  \nto assist our Team Members facing \nemergent and catastrophic situations. \nThe Giving Fund, which sits within \nthe Red Robin Foundation, provides \nemergency financial assistance, \nand has granted over $12.5 million to \nover 3,000 Team Members to date. \n04  Red Robin Sustainability Report 2021\nDiversity at Red Robin in FY2021\nTotal Workforce\nGender:\n 55%  Women  \n 45%  Men\nEthnicity:\n 44%  BIPOC  \n 54%  White  \n 2%   Declined  \nExecutive Team\nGender:\n 29%  Women  \n 71%  Men\nEthnicity:\n 29%  BIPOC  \n 57%  White  \n 14%   Declined  \n \nBoard of Directors\nGender:\n 4  Women  \n 6  Men\nEthnicity: \n 1  BIPOC  \n 9  White  44+54+255+45\n29+57+1429+71\n10+9040+60", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_RRGB_2021.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
