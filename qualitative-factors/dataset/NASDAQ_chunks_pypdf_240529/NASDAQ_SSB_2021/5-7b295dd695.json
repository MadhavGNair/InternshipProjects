The Company sponsors a broad leave plan employees may use for vacation, personal use and illness, and it awards paid leave based on tenure of service and title. \nWe believe that gauging our employees\u2019 satisfaction is \ncrucial to understanding the needs of our employees and developing a cohesive engagement and retention plan.  Given the recent merger, integration and conversion of South State Bank and CenterState Bank, N.A. to create the Bank as it exists today, we are focused on developing an employee satisfaction survey suitable to reflect and gather information about the combined Bank, its operations and its emerging culture.  We intend to deploy this tool in early 2022.  \nWe promote the health and wellness of our employees \nby strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, keeping the employee portion of health care premiums to a minimum and sponsoring various wellness programs.
