{"page_content": "The Foundation\u2019s donor advised fund service, Advance Change Funds, asks funders to agree to distribute at least 10% of \ntheir fund size to charities each year. Donors holding accounts also have the option of carving out 1% of their accounts for a communal fund that is administered by Amalgamated advisors to make grants to support urgent and timely community needs. Instead of keeping resources sitting in investments, we are helping to put dollars to work today. Since launching the Advance Change Funds, 50% of the resources that have come in have been granted out.
