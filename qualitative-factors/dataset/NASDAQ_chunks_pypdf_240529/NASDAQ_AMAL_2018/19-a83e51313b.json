It will be a symbol of our commitment to the transformation of young people and our work to advance social justice and policy. It is the physical manifestation of our work and a national model of a youth organizing space that other communities will learn from as they work within their own communities.\u201d\nBro/Sis continues to work with Amalgamated Bank, who currently handles the organization\u2019s commercial accounts.When Lazarre-White was asked why he chose to work with Amalgamated, he cited three reasons:\u201cFirst, it\u2019s because of the attention given to us as an account. Senior leaders at the bank have been very involved, which is \nnot something you get from larger, commercial banks.\u201d\nThe second reason is the security attached to the organization\u2019s account, and the ability for Amalgamated to securely \nsupport the organization\u2019s needs, especially in small check distribution.\nLastly, he cited an alignment in values between the two organizations.\nAmalgamated is proud to have Bro/Sis as a customer and to partner with them to meet their current and emerging needs.\n\u201cOur next chapter includes expanding our services to reach even more youth in New York City,\u201d said Lazarre-White.The Brotherhood/SisterSol website lays out the successful outcomes and testimonials that demonstrate the positive \nimpact the organization makes in the community, but what Lazarre-White says what he\u2019s most proud of is the organization\u2019s unyielding commitment to young people and that their mission has not changed from the very beginning.\nTo learn more, visit: www.brotherhood-sistersol.org\n19\u201cSo many components of the banking industry have been destructive,\u201d \nhe said. \u201cWe like being with a labor bank, one who has partnered with working New Yorkers and one who has served the working community. Amalgamated has a di\ufb00erent type of mission than other banks. They are aligned with our political views and, importantly, they support our mission.\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2018.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
