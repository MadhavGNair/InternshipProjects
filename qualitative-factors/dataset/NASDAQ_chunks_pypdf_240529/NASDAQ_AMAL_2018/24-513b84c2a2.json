{"page_content": "Equator doesn\u2019t just buy, roast and brew co\ufb00ee. They travel the world and connect with farmers and all of the other \nstakeholders along the \u2018chain of well-being.\u2019 \nFor McDonnell and Russell, their relationships with everyone involved in the process are important. \u201cIt takes a lot of energy to grow co\ufb00ee,\u201d said Russell. \u201cI think that the energy that goes into a cup of co\ufb00ee would be very \nsurprising to many of our customers.\u201d\nEquator does everything it can to make the process from seed to cup more e\ufb03cient and more sustainable. That can mean \nworking with farmers who operate hydroelectric mills on their properties to installing energy e\ufb03cient roasters that use 80% less natural gas than conventional roasters.\nIn 2011, Equator formalized its commitment to sustainability by becoming the \ufb01rst California co\ufb00ee roaster to attain \naccreditation as a Certi\ufb01ed B Corporation, a globally-recognized certi\ufb01cation that is only o\ufb00ered to businesses that are fully committed to rede\ufb01ning success to include a mission to create a more socially equitable world. Today, Equator operates seven retail cafes in the San Francisco Bay Area and has an expanding national wholesale business.\n\u201cWith every decision we look at the triple bottom line and how we a\ufb00ect our communities,\u201d continued Russell. \u201cWe \nbelieve business can be a force for good, and in Amalgamated Bank we found a partner that looks at the world in the same way.\u201d\nFor the last 15 years in a row, Equator has remained on The San Francisco Business Times\u2019 list of the Top 100 Women-\nOwned Businesses and was the \ufb01rst LGBTQ Certi\ufb01ed business to win the National SBA Small Business of the Year.
