{"page_content": "The project will reduce emissions by an estimated 1,360 metric tons of CO2 annually \u2014 roughly equivalent to removing 300 \ncars from the road each year. These reductions are a critical component of the District\u2019s ongoing e\ufb00orts to achieve the Sustainable DC and Clean Energy DC goals, as well as Mayor Bowser\u2019s recent commitment for the District to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This installation will also increase the city\u2019s installed solar capacity by almost 3%.\nThe buildings hosting these installations are owned by several of the largest nonpro\ufb01t a\ufb00ordable housing organizations in \nthe District, including So Others Might Eat, Victory Housing, Mi Casa, and Mission First, as well as for-pro\ufb01t housing owners, Urban Atlantic and Somerset Development Company.\n\u201cWe are very proud to support this outstanding group of nonpro\ufb01t a\ufb00ordable housing organizations and the residents that \ncall their properties home. These nonpro\ufb01t owners already do a great service by assisting thousands of hardworking residents with lower cost housing, and through this project they\u2019ll be able to help their residents even further by reducing their utility expenses,\u201d said NHT Assistant Vice President of Sustainability, Jared Lang.\nThis project is made possible through support from the DC Department of Energy and the Environment\u2019s (DOEE) Solar for \nAll program and the McArthur Foundation. Project \ufb01nancing included a $2.7 million loan from New Resource Bank, now part of Amalgamated Bank, and a $1.7 million investment by Monarch Private Capital, a tax equity partner.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be able to support so many great organizations with one single loan, and to help bring signi\ufb01cant clean \nenergy to DC and \ufb01nancial relief to low-income residents,\u201d said Keith Mestrich, President & CEO of Amalgamated Bank. \u201cThe District has built a powerful network of allies for a\ufb00ordable housing and for the expansion of solar energy and this project is a testament to their expertise and commitment, and \ufb01ts perfectly our mission of helping those who do good,do better.\u201d\n26", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2018.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
