They are at the heart of a network of groups \ncommitted to making change happen.\u201d\nLooking ahead, the Brennan Center believes that Amalgamated can and will empower the organization to invest in the \nfuture as Brennan continues to grow and expand its capacity to meet the moment. \n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful that Amalgamated has proven ready to help us fuel that growth and to help forge an alliance of like-\nminded organizations, especially as we embark on a path toward strengthening this country for all, not just the powerful few,\u201d concluded Butler.\n15\u201cLike the Brennan Center, Amalgamated is a mission-driven \norganization that believes every choice we makes needs to be intentional and informed with purpose,\u201d said Butler. \u201cAmalgamated is a partner in the truest sense of the word.
