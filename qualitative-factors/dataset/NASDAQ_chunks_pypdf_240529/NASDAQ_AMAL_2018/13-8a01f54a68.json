Many were being displaced as landlords were raising rents.\u201d\nAt least 60% of the tenants\u2019 employees meet the low-income threshold at the time they were hired. This requirement \nhelped the development qualify for New Market Tax Credits (NMTC) that included a target population requirement.\n13", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2018.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
