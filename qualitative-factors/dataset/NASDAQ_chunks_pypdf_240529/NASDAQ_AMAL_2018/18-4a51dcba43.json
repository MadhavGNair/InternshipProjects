{"page_content": "The Brotherhood/Sister Sol (Bro/Sis) was established in 1994 by two childhood friends, Jason \nWarwin and Khary Lazarre-White, to o\ufb00er supportive programs for Black and Latino youth in economically distressed communities. In its \ufb01rst year, the program helped guide 15 young men away from criminal activity and disassociated behavior, and back into school and stable lives. Today, in its twenty-fourth year of growth, the Harlem-based nonpro\ufb01t organization continues its work to develop youth into empowered critical thinkers and community leaders with more than a thousand youth participating in their programs annually.Brotherhood/Sister Sol helps youth in \neconomically distressed communities\nAn unyielding commitment to young people\nBro/Sis began working with Amalgamated Bank in 2000.\n\u201cThey took over the mortgage on our property, a brownstone in Harlem that served as our headquarters,\u201d recalls Lazarre-\nWhite. \u201cThen, in 2007 , we had the opportunity to purchase the adjacent land and we immediately needed capital, so we completed a re\ufb01nance and some of the necessary funds came from Amalgamated Bank.\u201d\nThat land represented promise and opportunity for the growing organization that was already creating a legacy through \nthe positive impact it was having on the youth it served, the communities it worked in and the broader community that learned from it.\nIn 2019, Bro/Sis will begin construction of a new, 20,000 square foot home for the organization.\n18", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2018.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
