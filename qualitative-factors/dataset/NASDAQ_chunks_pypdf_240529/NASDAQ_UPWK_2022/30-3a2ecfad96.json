We deprecated our previous survey instrument and implemented a new platform that will allow for broader sampling, greater automation and integration, and more robust tools for analysis, reporting, and post-survey action planning. Our new listening approach retains our existing bi-annual engagement survey but expands its scope to include both full-time employees and our hybrid workforce. In addition to this effort, our continuous-listening \u201cpulse\u201d surveys target specific segments of our workforce at different phases of their Upwork journey.\nIn Q4, we implemented these new pulse surveys in place of a company-wide engagement survey and developed \nnew overall targets for key dimensions in 2023:\n2023 Workforce Engagement Targets\nUpwork team members, Charlotte Johnson and Leslie Anderson, meet up for a windy coffee.\nMembers of the Outsourced Solutions team out for a walk in San Francisco's Chinatown.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_UPWK_2022.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
