{"page_content": "26Boosting income in rural Myanmar \nMuch of rural Myanmar\u2019s population is composed of \nsmall-plot farmers living in extreme poverty, without \nelectricity or modern technology. Proximity Designs  \nworks with these farmers to develop accessible, affordable products and services that decrease labor \nintensity and reduce environmental impacts while increasing average crop yields and related income.\nProximity Designs takes a user-centered design \napproach, soliciting customer input to ensure that \nproducts are relevant, useful, and appropriate for \ntheir daily use. It employs an iterative design process of rapid prototyping to create new \nproducts as quickly as possible.\u00a0 \nThe organization\u2019s design, manufacturing, and \ndistribution network now reaches about 80 percent \nof Myanmar\u2019s rural population. Its products and \nservices include irrigation equipment, crop advisory \nservices, solar lighting for off-grid households, and \nrural financial services. In late 2014, we began providing funding, software, and technical training \nto support the nonprofit.  \nIn one decade, Proximity Designs has helped 2.5 \nmillion people generate approximately US$54 million \nin additional income. In the next two years, Proximity Designs intends to expand services to 4,000 \nadditional villages and help its customers generate \nUS$122 million in additional income.\nBuild Change improves construction practices and \nsaves lives in emerging \ncountries by designing \ndisaster-resistant houses and \nschools and then training local homeowners, engineers, \nbuilders, and government \nofficials to build them.D-Rev designs, develops, and distributes products to improve \nthe health and income of people \nliving on less than US$4 a day. \nFrom a durable, affordable \nprosthetic knee for amputees to high-powered, low-maintenance \nphototherapy lamps to help treat \nbabies with jaundice, D-Rev\u2019s \nprojects are designed to scale for \nmaximum global impact.Design that Matters (DtM) is a nonprofit that uses design to \nsolve problems for and with the \npoor in developing countries. \nDtM designs new projects and \nservices and finds the best channels to deliver those \nsolutions by working with social \nenterprises, project partners, \ntechnology students, and \nprofessional volunteers in  \n20 countries.\nImpact design in action\nImage courtesy of Proximity Designs\nImage courtesy of Build Change Image courtesy of D-Rev Image courtesy of Design  \nthat Matters", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2015.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
