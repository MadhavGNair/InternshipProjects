View historical employee engagement data on page 28.\nDiversity and inclusion \nAutodesk employees represent a wide variety of backgrounds and contribute many different perspectives. Such diversity reflects the varied customer base we serve and leads to new ideas and creativity, contributing to the \ngrowth and value of the company. There is strong \nmomentum at Autodesk to ensure we have the right programs and approach to supporting diversity. Our employees see the value of diversity as well, taking the \ninitiative to establish and facilitate a number of diversity-\nfocused employee groups that provide networking and mentoring opportunities (see page 22). \nOur commitment to diversity is reinforced in our Code of \nBusiness Conduct, which states that discrimination or harassment based on a person\u2019s race, color, creed, religion, national origin, citizenship, age, gender, sexual \norientation, marital status, mental or physical disability, \nor any other classification protected by law will not be tolerated. This protection applies to all Autodesk employees and contingent workers worldwide. We \nrequire all managers with U.S. employees to complete \nharassment training every two years.\nWe ensure that our hiring practices are fair and non-\ndiscriminatory. In addition, we post all job openings on DiversityWorking.com, which is the largest diversity job board. We also partner with the Society of Women Engineers to engage female engineering talent, and \ncollaborate with Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit \norganization working to close the gender gap in the technology and engineering sectors. In early 2015, we hosted a Girl Geek Dinner , during which several female \nAutodesk employees had an opportunity to speak to women working in technology-focused fields or pursuing careers in technology. \nView global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity \ndata on page 28.\nTraining and development\nTraining and development opportunities are fundamental to our employees\u2019 continued professional development and to Autodesk\u2019s ongoing success.\nCareer development is a shared responsibility among \nemployees, their managers, and the company.

Managers, in turn, help set appropriate expectations, direct employees to useful resources and tools, and champion their staff \nfor relevant opportunities.
