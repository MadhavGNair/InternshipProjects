The training \nprovides them with the tools to identify, evaluate, \nand prevent potential corruption risks and keep them apprised of key anti-corruption regulation in \nthe markets that we serve. In 2017, 189 employees, \nincluding 14 members of our board of directors and \nexecutive leadership team, underwent this training.\nRESPONSIBLE GAMING\nWe have a suite of training courses for our Casino \nDivision on responsible gaming covering key \ntopics such as problem gaming (for both guests  \nand employees), recognizing fraudulent identification \ndocuments, and anti-money laundering, including  \na specialized class on the Bank Secrecy Act.   \nPROTECTING DATA \nInformation is one of our most valuable company \nassets, and protecting it from misuse, loss, or theft is \na high priority at Wynn Resorts.
