RMR served as a trusted business collaborator to \nproactively address the pandemic\u2019s impact on tenants.\nThe agreed upon rent deferral arrangements allowed tenants to delay rent payments for \nan agreed upon period of months or, in certain cases, a longer period. These restructures \nfor longer term deferred rent generally included lease term extensions and were entered \ninto with tenants of 1.4 million square feet of leased space in the aggregate. \nIn addition to providing rapid solutions, the RMR team made sure that tenants were \naware of available government support programs. Given the unpredictable nature of \nthe pandemic, with reopenings based on municipal mandates, the asset and property \nmanagement teams continue to stay in close contact with tenants as circumstances \ncontinue to shift. Many tenants are already on their way toward recovery and new \ndeferral requests are minimal. \nA beneficial outcome of the pandemic is the increased strength of the relationships \namong RMR and SVC\u2019s tenants. As we look toward the future, we plan to maintain a high \nlevel of social engagement and leverage the relationships built during this difficult time.\nINDUSTRY ALIGNED COVID-19 RESPONSEINTRODUCTION /\n11\nTHE RMR GROUP ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\nWWW.RMRGROUP.COM", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_RMR_2020.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
