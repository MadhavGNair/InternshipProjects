These engagement activities are coordinated through monthly conference calls.\nThe AAM engagement program is monitored by the Aegon RI Committee. Developments in \nengagement dialogues and progress made are a standing agenda item, and decisions on initiation and termination of engagement dialogues are made by the RI Committee. Where possible, AAM seeks to directly involve portfolio managers and analysts at AAM units in the engagement activities.\nIn 2013, the RI Committee adopted an Engagement Guideline as a supplement to the RI Policy. This \nEngagement Guideline sets out in more detail how engagement and related activities are organized at Aegon and AAM.
