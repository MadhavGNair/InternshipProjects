{"page_content": "20Policy Case Study: Firearms\nIn 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Connecticut in \nDecember 2012, and in light of the increased public concern and a major policy debate over the manufacture and retail sales of firearms in the United States, Aegon held internal discussions related to the regulation of manufacturers or retailers of civilian firearms and the call for divestment in this area.  \nDuring 2013, the RI Committee met, not only to consider the potential risks of exposure in this \narea, but also to identify certain research tools available to integrate firearms research and screening into investment decision-making practice. During these discussions the RI Committee determined that AAM clients\u2019 needs and exposure in this area did not necessitate a formal firearms screening or exclusion approach at this point. \nThe Committee further determined that if, in the future, increased risks or client concerns \nin this area necessitate further action, we have access to the necessary ESG research and data and service providers in order to implement screening, ESG integration or engagement strategies.  \nWhile the RI Policy does not currently take a position in the firearms debate, Aegon considers \nthis a very important topic and is therefore actively following the discussion and monitoring the related policy debate.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2013.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
