It was created through years of multi-stakeholder consultations including global law firms, companies, investors, NGOs, and international institutions.\nThe framework is increasingly necessary to identify the distinct but complementary \nresponsibilities of states and corporations in addressing human rights, so that each does not claim that the other is responsible while abuses continue unabated. In short, according to the framework and guidelines, global companies are expected to comply by:\u2022\n A\ndopting a human rights policy\n\u2022\n V\nerifying non-infringement through human rights due diligence\n\u2022\n A\nddressing any human rights abuses the company was involved in\n\u2022\n M\neasuring and reporting on human rights compliance\nEnvironmental protection \n\u2022 T he important engagement issues in 2013 included mining and operational safety \nperformance, oil drilling in sensitive environments, artisanal mining, oil-sands, shale gas, new project development standards environmental & social performance standards, operations subject to regulatory fines and other. \n\u2022\n K\names Capital is an investor signatory to the Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative \n(EITI), which supports improved governance in resource-rich countries through the verification and full publication of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas and mining.
