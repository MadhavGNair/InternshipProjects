The Board\u2019s goal is to create long-term value for \nBio-Techne\u2019s shareholders and ensure the vitality of the Company \nfor its customers, employees and other stakeholders. To achieve \nthis goal, the Board routinely monitors both the performance of \nthe CEO and the company as a whole. It also partners with the \nleadership team in the strategic planning process.
