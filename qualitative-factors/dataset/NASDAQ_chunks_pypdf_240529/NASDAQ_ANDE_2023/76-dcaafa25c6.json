These statements are based on assumptions and various \nfactors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nForward-looking statements are made in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Non-GAAP Financial measures. These statements are based on current expectations which involve several \nrisks and uncertainties and do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, but rather to plans and objectives for future operations. These statements include words such as \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cforecast\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201ccontinue\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cseek\u201d, \n\u201cmight\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cpredict\u201d, \u201cproject\u201d, \u201ctarget\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d or other similar expressions as well as statements regarding projections of future operating results, business strategy, environment, key trends and benefits \nof actual or planned acquisitions. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and you should not rely unduly on them, as they involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. While our management considers these \nassumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. \nFactors that could cause actual results to differently materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in our forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: disruption caused by health epidemics; competition \nin agricultural industry and other industries in which we operate; commodity market risks, including those that may result from weather conditions; financial market risks; counterparty risks; risks associated with changes to government policy or \nregulation, including changes to tax laws; risks related to acquisitions and disposition activities and achieving anticipated results; risks associated with merchant trading; risks related to our equity method investees and other factors detailed in \nreports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date \nof this review except as required by law.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2023.pdf", "page": 76, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
