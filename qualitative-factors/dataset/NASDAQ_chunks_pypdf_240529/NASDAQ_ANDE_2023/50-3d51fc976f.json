Contractors \nmeeting the criteria are classified as pre-qualified to work at The \nAndersons sites.\u00a0Contractors who struggle with some of the criteria \nundergo further review and may be classified as on \u201cprobation.\u201d Site \nproject managers and EHS will more closely monitor their on-site \nactivities to ensure safe contract work practices are utilized.\u00a0 \nContractors receive The Andersons specific safety training through the \nthird-party website or on-site at one of our facilities before starting \nwork. Once on-site, personnel work with the contract employees to \nassure safety of all during the entire scope of the project.FOSTERING A SAFETY \nCULTURE\nEmployees note safe and at-risk behaviors \nas part of the observation process.
