Water calculations were performed in accordance with GRI  Standards (GRI 303). Water discharge is the sum of effluents (treated or untreated wastewater), used water, unused water released to surface water, ground water or third party for \nwhich we do not have any further use. Water withdrawal is the sum of all water drawn from surface water, groundwater or third party for any use over the course of the reporting period. Many facilities withdrawal from groundwater and do not \nhave meters to accurately capture the data. Estimates have been made for these facilities where feasible. The Andersons will continue to refine their water withdrawal information each year as more data is captured and recorded.\n10. Waste metrics were performed in accordance with GRI Standards (GRI 306).  Waste definitions were in accordance with U.S. EPA 49 CFR Part 260-261. Waste values are still being refined as all facilities where The Andersons operates have not \nreported metrics due to their waste handling operations. These facilities are being addressed to ensure future data is captured.\n11. Social data was compiled using EEO-1 data for United States employees and Workday for all employment data (international).
