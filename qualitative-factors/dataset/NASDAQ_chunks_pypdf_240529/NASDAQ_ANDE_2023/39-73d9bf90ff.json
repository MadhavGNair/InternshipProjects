The company \ncontinued its support for the Northwest Ohio Chapter \nby supporting Project Playhouse. Various teams helped \nprepare parts for the Project Playhouse event. Project \nPlayhouse provides homeownership concepts to \nthe youngest members of the community, while also \nsupporting their parents in the joy of homeownership \nthrough home builds and renovation projects. This \nidea was transplanted in the Siouxland community by \nour Sioux City team who purchased a kit online and \nconstructed it as a donation to their local Habitat for \nHumanity chapter. It was such an overwhelming success, \na second playhouse was constructed by the team and \ndonated to Habitat for a second family. We continue \nto look for ways to transplant great ideas from one \ncommunity to the next, allowing for greater impact. \nWe also applaud the efforts of our teams in Waterloo, \nIndiana and Overland Park, Kansas who helped with \na house build and ReStore organizational project \nrespectively.\nVETERAN SUPPORT\nCARE KITS\nMany of The Andersons employees are \nveterans, having given their service and \ncommitment to their country.
