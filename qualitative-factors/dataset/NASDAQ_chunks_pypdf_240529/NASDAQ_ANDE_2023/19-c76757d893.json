We are committed to compliance with \npermits and licenses issued to our facilities.\u00a0\nMEASURABLE IMPROVEMENT  \nThe Andersons measures environmental compliance \nperformance by using the Environmental Reportable \nIncident Rate (ERIR) metric. This metric weighs serious \npollution events, of which our goal is always zero, \nregulatory reportable events/excursions from permit \nrequirements, and formal notices of non-compliance from \nregulatory agencies. These incidents are then weighed \nby hours worked within each business to normalize \nperformance. Annually, each business reviews their previous \nyear\u2019s performance and sets goals for the upcoming year in \nan effort to continually improve.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince this system was implemented in 2020, The \nAndersons has shown continuous improvement trends for \nenvironmental compliance. We attribute this improvement \nto implementing a risk-based EHS learning culture, \noperation's ownership of the environmental function, and \nlaunching of the Benchmark EHS management system \nacross all of The Andersons facilities.PUSHING FORWARD WITH \nENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND PRACTICES\n 1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0ERIRTHE ANDERSONS ERIR\n2020 2021\nPOLLUTION EVENTS: serious environmental impact requiring \na response and corrective action or monitoring \nNOV s: Notice of Violation  \nREPORTABLE EVENTS: administrative in nature; permit \nexceedances, minor/negligible impact to the environment, no \nresponse needed except making notification to agency ENVIRONMENTAL METRICS\n(Pollution Events*2 + NOVs + Reportable Events*0.5) *200,000\nMan Hours Worked\n2022\nERIR =", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2023.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
