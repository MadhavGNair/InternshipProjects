These products are designed \nwith a blend of micronutrients created to optimize plant health \nand maximize yield potential. They also feature DG \ntechnology, resulting in homogenous spherical \ngranules for easier blending, spreading, and \nmost importantly, increased efficacy. With The \nAndersons DG technology, granules break \ndown in the soil into thousands of sub-particles \nwhich increase the coverage and availability to \ncrops. \nHUMIC COATED AMMONIUM SULFATE (HCAS\u2122)\nThis innovative fertilizer product utilizes proprietary technology \nto improve upon traditional ammonium sulfate \ngranules by bonding them with carbon-rich \npotassium humate. These clean, spherical, free-\nflowing granules are designed for turfgrass \napplications, delivering nitrogen, sulfur, \nand humic acid with a single application, a \nmanufacturing challenge the industry had \nfaced for decades.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2023.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
