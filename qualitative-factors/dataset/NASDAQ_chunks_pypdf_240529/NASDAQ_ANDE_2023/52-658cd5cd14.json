This is why \nwe employed the services of Trinity Consultants to help \neducate our EHS leaders and many of our operations \npersonnel on PSM/RMP compliance. The course was \nfocused on understanding both the overall programs \nand information on new and impending updates to the \nstandards. This continuous improvement process of leader \neducation was a new initiative for 2022, and plans are in \nplace to standardize the path for the future with a focus on \nleadership engagement in EHS.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE DONATIONS\nThe Andersons provides direct financial support to \nemergency response organizations for equipment \ninvestments, including AED defibrillators, fire trucks, \nfacilities, and specific response equipment.
