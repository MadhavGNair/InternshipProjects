Ten topics were selected to hold the \ndesignation: \n\u2022 Bulk Storage Entry\n\u2022 Confined Space Entry\n\u2022 Control of Hazardous Energy\n\u2022 Combustible Dust\n\u2022 Elevated Work\n\u2022 Hazardous Material Management\n\u2022 Hot Work\n\u2022 Industrial Mobile Equipment\n\u2022 Rail Safety\n\u2022 Rigging, Hoisting, and Towing\nAdditionally, three SIF policies were developed and delivered \nas part of the initiative to eliminate SIF events: Safe Work, \nRisk Assessment and Reduction, and Incident Reporting and \nLearning from Incidents.\nThe policies are being implemented over a three-year time \nframe outlined below.\n2021 - Bulk Storage Entry, Confined Space Entry, Control of \nHazardous Energy, Elevated Work, Rail Safety and the three SIF \npolicies\n2022 - Combustible Dust, Hazardous Material Management, and \nHot Work\n2023 - Industrial Mobile Equipment and Rigging, Hoisting, and \nTowingRISK ORIENTED INSPECTIONS\nTo continue our focus on mechanical integrity and safety \nthroughout the year, The Andersons continues to employ an arc \nflash program that performs yearly studies on business electrical \nequipment. Equipment is evaluated and workers are informed \nabout potential electrical hazards and provided information \nregarding safe interaction when conducting maintenance work.\nDUST HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe Andersons reconfirmed dust hazard analysis (DHA) for sites \nwith combustible dust. We employed a third-party to revisit the \nDHAs for six sites that fall into this category.\nThe agriculture industry recognizes that dust from organic \nmaterials can result in high levels of combustibility.\u00a0The \ncombustibility of the material when combined with a heat \nsource and oxygen presents an elevated safety risk. The \nAndersons has assessed all facilities and a Dust Hazard Analysis \n(DHA) for each location.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe DHA is performed by a cross functional team which includes \nfacility and technical representatives.\u00a0Each facility examines \ntheir process by reviewing materials, equipment, current \ncontrols, and the current dust combustibility risk.\u00a0The team \nalso reviews improvements that will reduce or eliminate overall \nrisk.\u00a0These improvements are documented within the DHA and \nplaced into The Andersons risk management tracking system.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn conjunction with reaching the individual facility analysis, \nThe Andersons also recognized combustible dust as a Life \nCritical Policy. This LCP provides training to employees on how \nhousekeeping, equipment maintenance, and the integration \nof equipment monitoring all work together to manage the \ncombustible dust risk.\u00a0FOSTERING A SAFETY \nCULTURE\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2023.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
