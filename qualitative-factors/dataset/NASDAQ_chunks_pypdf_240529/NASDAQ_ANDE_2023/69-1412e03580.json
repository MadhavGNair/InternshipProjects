As reported in The Andersons 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2022 data.      \n2. Direct (Scope 1) emissions occur from owned/operated facilities. Our fleet emissions were not included in this year\u2019s review as we are still gathering data and the data currently captured did not equate to any significance for the review. Emissions were \ncalculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard for ESG reporting. Emissions calculated for facilities not under the regulatory reporting scheme followed the same calculation. Gas data was available for 75 sites out of 121 sites in 2021 \nand for 78 sites out of the 126 sites in 2022. Available data was included in the calculations.\n3. Biogenic CO2 emissions resulting from our ethanol facilities fermentation process are reported separately per GHG Protocol and GRI Standards (GRI 305-1).   \n4. Location-based Indirect (Scope 2) emissions related to emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam or heat consumed by the organization.   5. Scope 3 emissions reported for Category 6, corporate air travel as The Andersons is still refining our value chain scope 3 reporting and data.\n6. At some of our ethanol facilities, a portion of the fermentation process CO2 is captured and exported for commercial application (dry ice). The CO2 captured and sold are biogenic emissions and are therefore reported separately from our direct \nScope 1 emissions. The biogenic CO2 emissions were not reported in the 2022 Corporate Sustainability Review and have since been recalculated for inclusion in this year\u2019s review.\n7. Includes natural gas, fuel and electricity use at our facilities.  Renewable energy consumption represents hydro from some of our Canadian facilities.  \n8.
