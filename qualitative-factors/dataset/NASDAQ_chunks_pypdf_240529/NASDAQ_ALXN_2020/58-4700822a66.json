That included the vital \nclinical trials we conduct to develop our medicines. \nAs the pandemic set in, we worked quickly to \nprotect the integrity and continuity of our clinical \ntrials, setting and managing six strategic priorities:While there were many forecasts and models  \nout there tracking COVID-19 spread, we found \nthere weren\u2019t any commercially available options \nwith the level of detail we needed. None of  \nthem combined the current and future states  \nof COVID-19 specific to our clinical trial sites. \nSo, we built our own modeling solution. In \nmy opinion, it emerged as one of the most \nsophisticated COVID-19 modeling tools available. \nWe factored in not only epidemiology data, we also \nconsidered government regulations and citizen \ncompliance at the country and state levels. This \ngave us an accurate understanding of what was \nlikely to happen, how enrollment in trials might \nlook and what mitigating actions we should take. \nAs a quantitative scientist, I was happy to apply my \nskills in new ways to help people around the world.\nSincerely,\nMokeMoke Sharma, \nHead of Development \nOperations and  \nQuantitative Sciences\nINNOVATIVE MEDICINES  \nTo empower our teams to deliver on our strategic \nimperatives in an ever-evolving environment, we \ndeveloped our Alexion Product to Patient Model \n(AP2P). AP2P governs how we move through \ndrug development to commercial launches, \nconsidering all stakeholder needs end-to-end. \nThe goal is to ensure early consideration of \npatient needs, efficiency and consistency in our \napproach and deliverables across our pipeline. \nAbove all else, it does three things very well:\n \u2219Look after  \nour people\n \u2219Ensure patient \nsafety\n \u2219Maintain good \nclinical practice \n(GCP) \u2219Ensure data \nintegrity\n \u2219Drive the portfolio\n \u2219Reinforce the  \ntrials\u2019 infrastructure \nand vendor \necosystem1.
