The \nlaunch of the policy was coupled with a \nnew comprehensive e-Learning program \ndesigned to educate employees on how  \nto detect, prevent and predict gaps within \ndata governance.  \u2219Our revised Notification to Management \nProcess reinforces our commitment to open \ncommunication and aids Alexion employees \nin escalating quality issues in a timely and \ntransparent manner.\n \u2219Our new document management system, \nVault Quality, launched in 2020, improves \nour ability to work with controlled \ndocuments and provides robust content \norganization, detailed audit trails and \npowerful search capabilities.\nOne of my favorite sayings at Alexion is \u201cQuality \nis for Everyone,\u201d because it isn\u2019t just up to the \nQuality function to deliver on this promise \u2013 \nevery Alexion employee plays a role in delivering \nsafe medicines to our patients and building \ntrust within our communities. \nSincerely,\nLiz\nLiz Sullivan,\nExecutive Director,  \nQuality Business Planning  \nand Strategic VenturesPRODUCT SAFETY  \nThe safety of the patients we serve is \nalways top of mind, whether they\u2019re being \ntreated with approved Alexion medicines or \nparticipating in our access programs or clinical \ntrials.

There is a black market for nearly every \nmedicine, and ours are no exception. I\u2019ve \nhad the pleasure of teaming up with our IT \nand cybersecurity teams to prevent this from \noccurring, where possible.\nIn 2020, we continued to add serialization \ntechnology to all of our products, allowing \nhospitals to see and evaluate the legitimacy \nof the supply chain process of every medicine \npack they receive with a simple scan. We also \ncompleted a multiyear effort to upgrade our \nproduct features and packaging to enhance \ntraceability with overt and covert methods. \nEvery time a patient receives an Alexion \nmedicine, I want to be confident in where it \ncame from and trust in the quality and safety  \nof that medicine. \nSincerely,\nJim", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
