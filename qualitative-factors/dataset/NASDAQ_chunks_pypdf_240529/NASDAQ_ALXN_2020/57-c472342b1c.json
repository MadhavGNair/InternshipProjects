{"page_content": "2020 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT58\nDear Communities\nABOUT SERVE TRANSFORM ADVANCE REDEFINE ETHICS & COMPLIANCE REPORTING INDEX   \nADVANCING REVOLUTIONARY\nDIAGNOSTICS  \nIn my seven years at Alexion, I\u2019ve never \nbeen in a better position to help change \nlives by leveraging science early on in critical \nprocesses. Among my most gratifying \nresponsibilities is leading Alexion\u2019s cutting-\nedge diagnostics function. Accurate and \nearly diagnoses can help save lives and \nprevent years of unnecessary suffering. \nPeople with rare diseases often wait years to \nreceive a proper diagnosis and many never \nreceive one at all. Expecting physicians to \ncorrectly diagnose something they may have \nnever encountered before is asking a lot. \nIn response, we\u2019ve developed RARE \nANSWERSTM in collaboration with leading \nchildren\u2019s hospitals and technology and \ndata-science developers. RARE ANSWERS \nis a system of innovative and sustainable \nSharon Barr, \nHead of Research,  \nData Sciences, Genomics, \nBioinformatics and Diagnostics\ntools designed to help shorten the diagnostic \njourney and time to initiating treatment \nof children with a rare disease. These tools \naim to deliver actionable data to physicians \nby analyzing phenotypic and genomic data, \nincorporating precision software, medical \ninformation and clinical insights. Alexion \nhas acted as a steward of this program for \nfive years as part of our commitment to the \nneeds of all people with rare diseases. \nOur groundbreaking work with RARE \nANSWERS is, quite literally, saving lives by \nsaving time for patients with rare diseases and \ndevastating conditions. That makes coming to \nwork in the morning incredibly worthwhile.\nSincerely,\nSharon<14 Hours<14 Hours\nANOTHER WORLD-RECORD   \nDIAGNOSIS  \nAlong with Rady Children\u2019s Hospital, Alexion \nwas part of a team that achieved a new \nrecord in December 2020 for the fastest \ngenetic-testing diagnosis with a treatment \noption in less than 14 hours. This is even \nfaster than the world record a similar Alexion \ncollaboration earned in 2018.
