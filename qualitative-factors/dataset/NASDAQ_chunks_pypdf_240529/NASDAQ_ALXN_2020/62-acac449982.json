{"page_content": "2020 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT63\nDear Communities\nABOUT SERVE TRANSFORM ADVANCE REDEFINE ETHICS & COMPLIANCE REPORTING INDEX   \nCREATING AND MAINTAINING\nPATIENT REGISTRIES\nAs a specialist in rare bone diseases, I  \n have had firsthand experience helping \npatients living with hypophosphatasia (HPP). \nUnderstanding their medical needs and \nchallenges is paramount. \nOne of the ways in which Alexion works to \nbetter understand patient needs is through \nthe patient registries we have established to \ngather patient input and perspectives. Patient \nregistries are conducted over the long term \nand are a key source of real-world data that \nallow us to better understand the disease, \nwhat patients experience in their daily lives, \nand how the disease affects their functional \ncapacity and quality of life. I believe they are \nfoundational to Alexion\u2019s work, helping us gain \nreal insights from physicians and patients that \nenable us to improve patient outcomes and \nhelp shape the medical practice to ensure  \nthat patients\u2019 needs are met. 2020 marked the fifth anniversary of the \napproval of STRENSIQ\u00ae (asfotase alfa), the \nonly available therapy for HPP that treats \nthe underlying cause of the disease. We \nhave established a long-term, observational \nHPP registry, which includes patients from \naround the globe. The HPP registry has been \nquite unique and instrumental in building \nthe body of evidence for HPP, facilitating \npatient access to treatment, and providing a \nplatform for further research studies (some \nat the request of regulators). We are about to \nlaunch a new registry website with resources \nand learnings from the studies, including \npublications and congress presentations.\nAs a classically trained musician, I can\u2019t help \nbut liken successful patient registries to great \nsheet music. All the information is there, it \njust needs to be put into play. \nSincerely,\nAnna Anna Petryk, \nExecutive Medical Director, \nGlobal Medical Affairs Leader, \nHPP and Amyloidosis\nDISCUSSING PATIENT   \nREGISTRIES IN GERMANY  \n\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re working to facilitate a dialogue around \npatient registries within the broader rare \ndisease field. As part of the Rarity Value event \nseries in Germany, Alexion participated in \na virtual roundtable to discuss rare disease \nregistries and the opportunity to co-create \nwith relevant stakeholders.  \n- Graham Skarnvad, Vice President,  \nGeneral Manager Germany, Commercial \nBIOBANK IS OPEN  \nAlexion has started a BioBank initiative \nthat\u2019s dedicated to streamlining our \nbiospecimen procurement and archiving \nprocess and creating an accessible library \nthat\u2019s unique to rare disease. Through this \ninitiative, patients gift their biospecimens, \nwhich are unique to their disease, for \nresearch toward better diagnostics \nand therapies. This effort offers Alexion \nand collaborators potential for deriving \nscientific insights from the data generated \nusing these samples.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 62, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
