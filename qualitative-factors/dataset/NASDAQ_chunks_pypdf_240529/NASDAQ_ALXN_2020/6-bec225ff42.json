I have heard \nthis often throughout my three decades \nof service in this purpose-driven industry. \nNever has it rung so true as in 2020. Since \nour founding in 1992, when Alexion \npioneered the field of complement biology, \nthis perspective has been at the heart \nof everything we do. And that factored \nsignificantly in my becoming part of this \namazing team just a few years ago. \nWe are filled with a sense of purpose to \nlive our mission to transform the lives \nof people affected by rare diseases and \ndevastating conditions. And, every day, our \nteams proudly bring our medicines to the \nthousands of patients around the world who \ndepend on them, especially during a year \nwith so many challenges.\nPerhaps most importantly, our ambition  \nto deliver on our mission is only growing. Today, our five innovative medicines are approved \nfor the treatment of seven rare diseases and \ndevastating conditions. Our robust pipeline of \n20-plus development programs, with expected \ngrowth from more than five novel investigational \nnew drug applications by 2025, is only a start  \nto the impact we will continue to have on  \nbehalf of our patients. \nWe listen to and continuously work to understand \npatients and those who work diligently to help \nthem. They are our inspiration to turn the  \nimpossible into what\u2019s possible. Every day. \nSincerely,\nBrian\nBrian Goff,\nExecutive Vice President,  \nChief Commercial and  \nGlobal Operations Officer\nBrian, getting some \nfresh air while working \nfrom homeLET ME TELL YOU  \nABOUT ALEXION\nALEXION AT-A-GLANCE\nK~3.5   \nEmployees \nglobally \n+50   \nCountries with  \npatients servedALXN \nNASDAQ Exchange \nTicker Symbol \nB$6   \n2020 revenues  \nin USD (For more \nfinancial information,  \nplease see our  \n2020 Form 10-K)+B$1 \nInvested in research \nand development  \nin 2020\n20   \nDevelopment  \nprograms5 Approved \ntreatments for  \n7  rare diseases \nand devastating \nconditions ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
