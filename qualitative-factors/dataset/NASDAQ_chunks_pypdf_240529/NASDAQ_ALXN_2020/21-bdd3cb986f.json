That\u2019s one  \nof the reasons I appreciate being in a position \nto make a difference every day, not only for \nmy company, but for the planet we all share. \nI get to help oversee Alexion\u2019s commitment \nto excellence in managing and reducing our \nenvironmental footprint. \nManaging Environmental,  \nHealth and Safety \nOur commitment to environmental \nstewardship, and the health and safety  of our people and the places we call home, \nis governed by a strong Environmental, Health  \nand Safety (EHS) Policy that carries our CEO\u2019s \nendorsement. I take this policy personally \nbecause it covers my actions and those of \nthe entire Alexion team around the globe, \nincluding our contractors. \nOur environmental management system (EMS) \nfollows widely accepted global standards, \nincluding ISO 14001, and is backed by an \nextensive suite of in-house EHS standards.\nIn 2019, we worked with an independent \nconsultant that completed a comprehensive \nEHS audit at all of our manufacturing sites \nand research and development (R&D) facilities \nworldwide. The audit identified areas for \nimprovement and, subsequently, each location \ndeveloped specific action plans and focused on \nJoseph Paradiso, \nDirector, Environmental  \nHealth and Safety \ncontinuous improvement throughout 2020. \nExamples include enhancements to the \nEHS management review process, actions \naimed at scaling and standardizing internal \nreporting elements, and improvement in  \ncompliance activities.\nI\u2019m extremely confident in the steps we\u2019re \ntaking across the organization to help \nsustain a healthy planet, as well as maintain \na safe work environment. My colleagues will \nshare more about that, and I expand on our \noccupational health and safety efforts on \nPage 52.\nSincerely,\nJoeZero WasteZero Waste\nIn 2020, we maintained our zero process waste-\nto-landfill status.
