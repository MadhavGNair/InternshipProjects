I see \nthat firsthand in my frequent engagement \nwith Alexion\u2019s Board of Directors, which sets \nthe highest standards for our employees, \nofficers, and the Board itself and its individual \nmembers. The Board oversees and monitors \nthe performance of our Executive Committee, \nwhich is responsible for the day-to-day \nconduct of our business. My colleagues and I meet with the Nominating \nand Corporate Governance Committee at least \nannually to present updates about Alexion\u2019s \nCSR strategies, programs and plans. This \nCommittee oversees environmental, health, \nsafety and social responsibility matters, and \nreviews this CSR report. \nWhen it comes to director education, Alexion \nfunds Board member education on any topic, \nincluding CSR and governance, as well as \nsharing timely articles and updates with the \nBoard on a variety of topics, including DI&B, \ngovernance, CSR, shareholder engagement \nand risk management. Board members  \nalso belong to the National Association  \nof Corporate Directors (NACD).\nI derive great satisfaction in working \nwith Alexion\u2019s Board in helping to ensure \nexemplary corporate governance. \nSincerely,\nDougBOARD OF DIRECTORS   \nAT-A-GLANCE  \n9 Number of Independent Directors\n(Chairman is independent) \n63.1  Average Age of Directors  \n4.4  Years Average Director Tenure  \n20%  Female Directors  The Board has four standing committees:\n1.
