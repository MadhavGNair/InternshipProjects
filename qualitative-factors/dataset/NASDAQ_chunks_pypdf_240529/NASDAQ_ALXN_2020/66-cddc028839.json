This \ncombination of experience has served me well since joining Alexion in early 2020.\nAmong my favorite responsibilities this past year was heading up Alexion\u2019s \nannual Integrity Matters Week, which aims to demonstrate how our value \nof Integrity is at the core of everything we do and how we embrace its \nfundamental role in our daily work. During Integrity Matters Week, we \nprovided colleagues with opportunities to build their compliance and \nquality mindset and capabilities by hearing from patient organizations, \nbehavioral science experts and Alexion leaders. We enhanced our \nemployees\u2019 personal integrity journeys through training sessions, panel \ndiscussions, and engaging resources and tools like interactive job aids  \nand an Augmented Reality application that brings to life a Nobel Prize \nwinning framework for making ethical decisions.\nIn connection with Integrity Matters Week, we partnered with the Alexion  \nCSR team to raise funds for SeriousFun Children\u2019s Network, a global \ncommunity of camps and programs providing life-changing experiences \nto children with serious illnesses and their families, free of charge. It was \nexceptional to see how Alexion came together as a community to live our \nvalue of Integrity and at the same time, contribute to an amazing cause. \nSincerely,\nLoren\nLearn what Alexion \nemployees have to \nsay about integrity \nin this short video.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 66, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
