These sessions are designed \nto tackle timely issues, such as our series on racial \nequity. Roughly 100 managers continue to tune into \nthe Manager Enablement Series each month. Manager Development Program (MDP) \nAmong our most significant development \ninitiatives of 2020, MDP seeks to grow our  \n600-plus strong people-manager community \nand enable them to deliver a positive employee \nexperience. Because of the pandemic, we \npivoted to a virtual platform and reorganized \nmodules to prioritize topics like resilience, \nschedule management, and peer interactivity \nand learning. More than half of Alexion people \nmanagers from 14 countries participated with \nthe goal of reaching the other half in 2021.Virtual Leadership Roundtables \nQuarterly sessions built to inspire and discuss \nbest practices in leadership, this included a \nsession led by Nancy Koehn, a Harvard Business \nSchool researcher and author of \u201cForged in Crisis: \nThe Power of Courageous Leadership in Turbulent \nTimes.\u201d Koehn\u2019s roundtable helped participants \ngain confidence in navigating the unique \nchallenges of 2020.
