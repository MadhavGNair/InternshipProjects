One constant, though, has \nbeen our commitment to solutions informed by \nnot only patients\u2019 physical conditions, but also \ntheir social and emotional needs. \nIn 2019, we launched Solutions To Accelerate \nResults (STAR) for patients to ensure we develop \ndeep expertise in understanding patient insights \nand accelerate patient-centered innovation. The \nSTAR team has taken this commitment to a new \nlevel. Patient insights and innovative solutions \ngarnered through STAR are informing research \nand early clinical trial development, helping to \nbetter anticipate patient challenges.\nIn 2020, we more fully integrated our proprietary \nPatient and Stakeholder Value (PSv) Framework \ninto the Alexion Product to Patient (AP2P) \noperating model to ensure we are identifying \nand embedding into the Alexion drug \ndevelopment teams those patient insights  \nthat will create the greatest value. Every year, we conduct STAR PSv disease \nworkshops. These are forums where we invite \npatients and other stakeholders to share \nwith us their insights about living with a rare \ndisease. In 2020, we conducted two STAR \nPSv workshops (ALS and dermatomyositis), \nboth virtually, with participation from \npatients, caregivers and physicians. One of \nthe workshops uncovered a need for mental \nhealth resources across our portfolio, which \ninspired our teams to co-create solutions to \nprovide mental health support to patients  \nand caregivers living with rare diseases. The \nAlexion team is now evaluating an online  \ntool to help meet this need. \nActively listening to patients and all our \nstakeholders to uncover how we might  \nbest meet their needs and expectations  \nis what inspires me and what gets me  \nup in the morning, every single workday.  \nThis is delivering on our employee and  \npatient experience.\nSincerely,\nJudy\nJudy Campagnari,\nHead of STAR Strategy  \nand Planning\nJudy, enjoying the holidays with her daughter\nSolutions To \nAccelerate Results \nfor Patients \ninforms research and early \nclinical trial development \nto help better anticipate  \npatient challenges", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
