Knowing that the \nbest thing I could do to protect my colleagues \nwas to stay away from them ran counter to  \nmy DNA. But we wasted no time in taking  \nthe necessary steps.\nAlexion ramped up our IT infrastructure so that \nour employees could more easily work from \nhome and virtualized our onboarding process, \nintern programs, LEAP offerings (see Page 46) \nand our Manager Development Program.\nThe situation also inspired us to launch weekly \nPulse Surveys to learn how people felt about \nworking from home or being on-site as essential \nemployees during the pandemic. Thanks to our \nTotal Rewards and Employee Experience teams, \nwe took steps to ease employees\u2019 anxieties \nJackie Donovan, \nHead of People OperationsADAPTING WORK DURING  \nTHE GLOBAL PANDEMIC\nexpressed through these surveys, including \ncovering 100% of U.S. COVID-19 testing and \ntreatment, launching the You & Your Wellbeing \ncenter on our intranet and encouraging \nemployees to take time off as needed.\nWe engaged a small but diverse subset \nof Alexion employees, whom we dubbed \nReflectors, led by Camila Hartvig, Head of \nInternational Commercial, to participate in \nvirtual listening sessions and provide potential \nsolutions to virtual work and return-to-site \nefforts to inform our Workplace Activation \ninitiative. Workplace Activation has taken \ninput from a variety of sources to identify the \nbest parts of working from home, resulting in \na flexible work philosophy that emphasizes \nchoice, equality and trust.\nI\u2019m proud of the way we\u2019ve rallied and used \nthis period of intense change as a learning \nopportunity to make our employee  \nexperience even stronger. \nSincerely,\nJackieJackie, spending time with her son", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 41, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
