I knew our \npeople managers and leaders were going to \nneed extra support as they led teams through \nunfamiliar territory, while remaining on course \nto be the leader in rare disease. \nWe needed a variety of training offerings \nto quickly activate and engage our people \nmanagers in timely and relevant conversations. \nPREPARING THE  \nNEXT GENERATION   \nOF  LEADERS\nTyler Durham, \nGlobal Head of  \nLeadership Capability\nThis resulted in our Rare Leader Development \nPortfolio, an integrated suite of programs \nand tools, organized into several delivery \ncategories: self-directed learning, focused \ndevelopment programs and experiences, \ncoaching and assessments, and development \ntools and best practices (see Page 48 for more \ninformation). This portfolio approach enables \nour leaders to thrive in the complexity of the \nrare disease landscape.\nBeyond formal training programs, we\u2019ve \nmade a push to ensure that all employees \nare having meaningful conversations with \ntheir managers about their performance \nand career goals on a regular basis. Instead \nof yearly reviews, we\u2019ve set the expectation \nthat employees should have performance \ndevelopment conversations with their \nsupervisors at least once a quarter. We also recognized that COVID-19 \nsignificantly disrupted the way we work and \nsome of the objectives that we had for 2020. \nWe adjusted our performance process so that \nless time was spent looking back on things  \nwe couldn\u2019t control, and more time was \nspent on developing for the future. \nOur investment in leadership development \nand our agility in times of crisis have had \na clear impact on the stability of our \norganization and our bottom line. We \nenhanced some of our strategic leadership \nand talent processes, including succession \nplanning and identification of business \ncontinuity and critical roles, and high \npotential employees to ensure we continue  \nto build our leadership capacity and \ncapabilities. Of our 1,250 openings in 2020,  \nwe were able to fill 23% of them internally. \nIt\u2019s been a challenging year to say the  \nleast, but when I see data like these, I feel \nextremely confident in our ability to handle \nany hurdle in the future. \nSincerely,\nTylerTyler, having fun with his daughter", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
