In an \neffort to possibly alleviate the consequences \nassociated with severe COVID-19, Alexion \ninitially provided SOLIRIS through expanded \naccess/compassionate use for select patients \nhospitalized with severe, COVID-19-related \npneumonias in the U.S., France and Italy.\nPreliminary clinical evidence from patients \nwho received SOLIRIS through these programs \nsuggested that terminal complement inhibition When we came to work for Alexion, we  \nboth knew we were joining a special \ncompany. And in 2020, being a special company \nmeant doing what we could in the fight \nagainst the COVID-19 pandemic. This included  \nexploring the use of Alexion medicines  \nSOLIRIS\u00ae (eculizumab) and ULTOMIRIS\u00ae  \n(ravulizumab-cwvz). \nInsights from infections with other coronaviruses, \nalongside pre-clinical data, suggested that the \ncomplement system, which is part of the body\u2019s \nimmune system, could possibly be targeted to \ntreat some of the most severe clinical aspects \nof the infections with SARS-CoV-2. Observations may improve the chances of survival in patients \nwith severe COVID-19. Based on that evidence \nand recognizing the urgent needs of patients, \nAlexion submitted an emergency Expanded \nAccess Program (EAP) protocol in the U.S. and \nthe EU for SOLIRIS in severe COVID-19-related \npneumonia to make SOLIRIS more widely \navailable to eligible patients.\nOur controlled clinical trial with ULTOMIRIS \nin patients with severe COVID-19 requiring \nmechanical ventilation has paused enrollment at \nthe recommendation of the Independent Data \nMonitoring Committee due to futility (lack of \nefficacy). Analysis of study results is ongoing to \ndetermine if there are subgroups of patients who \nmay benefit from treatment with ULTOMIRIS. The \nuse of ULTOMIRIS in hospitalized patients with \nCOVID-19 not yet requiring mechanical ventilation \nis being explored in the TACTIC-R trial conducted \nin the U.K.\nThe opportunity to explore how we might help \nalleviate the suffering caused by this pandemic  \nis an honor for both of us and our teams.\nSincerely,\nDerek and ShamsahDerek, picking apples with his family", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 59, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
