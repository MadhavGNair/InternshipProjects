This \nexperience is often amplified for individuals \nliving with rare diseases and devastating \nconditions, many of whom have complex \njourneys involving multiple healthcare \nprofessionals, payers, advocacy organizations, \nfamily members, caregivers and others.\nLEAP is Alexion\u2019s series of experiential \nlearning sessions designed to immerse team \nmembers in the patient journey from diverse \nstakeholder perspectives within the rare disease \necosystem. LEAP also brings in patients and \nother stakeholders along the journey to provide \ninsights on the \u201cmoments that matter\u201d and \nidentify solutions that will create the most value. \nMy colleagues consistently highlight LEAP as an \nindustry-leading model for fostering a patient-\ncentric mindset, deepening the understanding  of the patient journey and an opportunity to \ngather insights that cultivate innovation. To date, \nmore than 2,700 employees in 45 countries have \ncompleted at least one LEAP session. \nIn 2020, we re-imagined our LEAP experiences \nto be virtual and on-demand, and to incorporate \nour innovation process and a \u201cchoose your own \nadventure\u201d experience to put team members \nin the shoes of patients and stakeholders \nand heighten the emotional and challenging \ndecisions. We introduced two new disease-state \nsimulations, created in alignment with our DI&B \npriorities. These new modules featured diverse \nstakeholders, and we sourced diverse voice \ntalent to authentically match the characters in \nthe simulations. We also listened to feedback \nfrom our LEAP alumni and launched two new \ncapability-enhancing modules: Active and \nEmpathetic Listening, and Storytelling, to help \nparticipants have more meaningful and impactful \nconversations across a range of stakeholders.\nI feel incredibly humbled and inspired to oversee \nour LEAP portfolio because I can think of no more \nimpactful way to honor the journey of our patients \nthan to take a walk in their shoes.\nSincerely,\nRohita A GIANT LEAP FOR  \nHUMANKIND  \n2,700+2,700+\nemployees in 45 countries have  \ncompleted at least one LEAP session.\nLearn, Evolve, A ctivate and deliver for Patients", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
