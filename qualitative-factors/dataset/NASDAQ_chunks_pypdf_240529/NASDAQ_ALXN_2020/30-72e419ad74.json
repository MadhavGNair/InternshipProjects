We are  \nalso developing  \na STRENSIQ\u00ae  \n(asfotase alfa) \ninjection tracking  \ntool for HPP patients  \nas a resource for \nhome injection. \nAdditionally, the \nAustrian patient \ndisease awareness \nwebsite for PNH \nwas fully refreshed \nthis year, after \nthe integration of \ncomments by a \nleading HCP in PNH.\nDaphnee Pushparajah, \nDirector, Patient Advocacy and Engagement\nI feel incredibly privileged to work with patient \norganizations around the world that provide critical \nsupport along the patient journey. They serve as an \nessential source of insights to Alexion as we seek to \nstrengthen our own understanding of the rare disease \ncommunity\u2019s current perspectives and experiences. \nAs part of an important effort with one of our \nlongtime collaborators, Genetic Alliance UK, in 2020 \nwe supported a patient experience survey of people \nliving with a rare disease or caring for someone with \na rare disease. We were able to hear directly from \nmore than 1,000 people living with rare diseases on \nthe fragmentation of their own care pathway, and we \npublished a report on the findings. Our report provides \ninsights and recommendations for the implementation \nof the anticipated new Rare Disease Framework in the \nU.K. Using these insights, we\u2019ll be able to inspire policy \naction to shift this troubling status quo.\nI\u2019m grateful to work with so many other patient \norganizations throughout the world, especially as we \nwork to be a key influencer of patient organization \nengagement standards across the industry through \nongoing, proactive thought leadership. Together with \npatient organizations, I\u2019m confident we can help \nchange the lives of patients living with rare diseases \nand devastating conditions.\nSincerely,\nDaphnee\nCOLLABORATING WITH   \nPATIENT ORGANIZATIONS\ninfusion centers for \npeople in Canada \nand Italy.\n Mary-Sheila:  \nI know we\u2019ve \nboth been working \nhard to support \npatients in their \njourneys. In the \nU.S., we worked \nwith thousands of \npatients, expanded \nthe injection \ntraining services for \nHPP patients, and \nlaunched a program \ncalled Peer Connects, \nwhich connects \npatients living with \nthe same condition \nto share their journey \nand ask questions. \n Encarna: \nAnother great \nexample of the way \nwe\u2019ve worked to \ngather and respond \nto patient needs is ALEXION LEADERSHIP   \nIN HEALTHCARE RESEARCH  \nIn 2020, Alexion\u2019s Chief Corporate Affairs \nOfficer, Tanisha Carino, was appointed to the \nBoard of Governors of the Patient-Centered \nOutcomes Research Institute (PCORI).
