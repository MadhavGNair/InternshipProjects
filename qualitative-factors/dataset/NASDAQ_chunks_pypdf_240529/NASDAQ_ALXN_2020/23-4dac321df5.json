{"page_content": "2020 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT24\nABOUT SERVE TRANSFORM ADVANCE REDEFINE ETHICS & COMPLIANCE REPORTING INDEX   Dear CommunitiesEnvironmental Data Footnotes\nAll 2020 environmental data have undergone third-\nparty verification in accordance with ISO 14064-3:2006. \nPlease view the verification statement here. 2018-2020 \nenvironmental data includes Alexion\u2019s facilities in Ireland, \nNew Haven, Connecticut, and Bogart, Georgia. Our 2020 \nenvironmental data represent a reduced environmental \nfootprint due to several factors: improved efficiencies, more \ntargeted metering and consolidation of manufacturing \npreviously performed in two U.S. facilities now being \nperformed at one. We have restated our water consumption \ndata for 2018 and 2019 to correct the unit of measurement \nstated in the original data. \nAll greenhouse gas emissions are measured in metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent (metric tons CO2e) and follow the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Fourth \nAssessment. For 2020, gross market-based accounting for \nall in-scope sites is 11.264 1,000 metric tons. Information \nprovided for Scope 2 is gross market based.\nFor Scope 1, all U.S. sites are calculated using the following \nformula: Natural Gas (mmBtu Nat Gas x Emissions Factor \n[53.06 kg CO2e]) + Fuel Oil Generators (mmBtu Fuel Oil x \nEmissions Factor [73.96 kg CO2e]) x 0.001 (conversion factor \nfor kilograms to metric tons). \nFor Scope 1, all Ireland sites are calculated using the following \nformula: Natural Gas (kWh Nat Gas x 0.9017 Net Calorific \nValue [TJ/kt] x 0.0000036 conversion to TJ x Emissions Factor \n[55.793 tonnes CO2e]/TJ) + Fuel Oil (Liters Fuel Oil x 0.85 \ndensity [kg/l] x 0.000001 kilo tonne x 43.31 Net Calorific Value \nx Emissions Factor [73.3 tonnes CO2e]/TJ). \nFor Scope 2, sites in Ireland, all electricity is from 100% \nrenewable sources so the emission factor is 0 [0 tonnes \nCO2e]/kWh).\nFor Scope 2, sites in Northeastern U.S. are calculated using \nthe following formula: Electricity (MWh) x Emissions Factor \n(558.2 lb./MWh) x 0.000453 metric tons/lb. (conversion factor \nfor pounds to metric tons). \nFor Scope 2, the Georgia, U.S. site is calculated using the \nfollowing formula: Electricity (MWh) x Emissions Factor \n(1089.4 lb./MWh) x 0.000453 metric tons/lb. (conversion  \nfactor for pounds to metric tons).ENVIRONMENTAL DATA 2018 2019 2020\nENERGY USE AND EMISSIONS\nEnergy Consumption (terajoules)  \nfrom Nonrenewable Sources 227.05 250.98 183.22\nNatural gas 166.39 190.23 133.10\nFuel oil 0.01 0.01 0.51\nElectricity 60.65 60.73 49.61\nEnergy Consumption (terajoules)  \nfrom Renewable Sources75.24 79.64 80.66\nElectricity 75.24 79.64 80.66\nEnergy Intensity (terajoules/$1,000,000 revenue) 0.073 0.066 0.044\nScope 1 Emissions (1,000 metric tons CO2e) 8.48 9.77 6.90\nScope 2 Emissions (1,000 metric tons CO2e) 5.36 5.20 4.37\nEmissions Intensity \u2013 Scopes 1 and 2\n(1,000 metric tons CO2e/$1,000,000 revenue)0.003 0.003 0.002\nWATER AND WASTE\nWater Consumption (megaliters) 266,077 385,530 254,808\nRegulated Waste Generated (metric tons) 654.10 756.92 640.80\nHazardous waste 98.70 305.87 189.80\nNonhazardous waste 555.40 451.05 451.10\nLandfill 0 0 0\nRegulated Waste Recycled (metric tons) 505.40 422.54 350.30", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
