We began \nfocusing on Brain Health as a company before \nthe pandemic hit, anticipating that this critical \ntopic would increase in relevance, regardless  \nof current events. What we didn\u2019t realize was  \nhow timely these efforts would become.  \nWhat\u2019s important to understand is that Brain \nHealth means more than just mental health.  \nIt includes the broader physical, emotional  \nand social factors that impact our well-being. \nBrain Health helps everyone feel motivated,  \nsafe and empowered to make purposeful  \nand productive choices. In 2020, we took the following steps to further  \nour commitment to Brain Health at Alexion: \n \u2219Building momentum by reminding \ncolleagues about available benefits like \nthe Employee Assistance Program, private \nhealthcare and existing local programming. \n \u2219Soliciting feedback from colleagues \nthrough surveys and active listening \nconversations at all levels of the \norganization. \n \u2219Creating awareness of Brain Health through \ninternal communications, local pilots and \nincreasing visibility of preexisting resources. \n \u2219Joining One Mind At Work, a global coalition \nof employers deploying best practices for \nworkplace Brain Health.
