In the face of the \ndevastating COVID-19 crisis, we were able to \nuphold our commitment to local communities \nby pivoting to new ways of supporting them. \nAlexion expanded its annual volunteerism event \nfrom a single day to a full week and went 100% \nvirtual, with great success. The desire of our \nemployees to live our values was as strong as \never despite the circumstances of 2020. \nThe success of our employee volunteerism \nefforts is linked to the introduction of our online \nvolunteer engagement tool in early 2020. Our \nvolunteer portal, Community Connect, acts as  \na central hub for all our volunteer initiatives and \nenables my colleagues to quickly search and \nregister for volunteer activities around the world.\nWe want to make it easy and meaningful for all \nour employees to give their time. My colleagues sure answered the call in this most challenging  \nof years. In addition to our formal Global Week  \nof Service activities, we provided a variety of  \nother virtual volunteer opportunities such as: \n \u2219Working through the Red Cross and 7 Cups  \nto support people who have been impacted \nby a natural disaster, COVID-19 or other crises. \n \u2219Providing skills-based and general \nvolunteering services for math tutoring, \ntranslations, and connecting with isolated \nsenior citizens.\n \u2219Assisting with academic research through  \nthe Zooniverse citizen scientist platform. \n \u2219Sharing advice with students interested \nin pursuing careers in finance and STEM \nthrough information sessions, like a  \nwebinar hosted by the Citizen Schools.\nA global pandemic is not the time to step  \nback from volunteering or engaging with  \nour communities. Quite the opposite \u2013  \nit\u2019s so much more important. \nSincerely,\nLeanne\nLeanne Blanchette, \nSenior Manager, CSR8 Hours8 Hours\nAs part of Alexion\u2019s Volunteer Paid Time \nOff Policy, each eligible employee receives \nup to eight hours of paid time off per \ncalendar year for qualified volunteer \nactivities, in addition to the time off for \nparticipation in our Global Week of Service.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
