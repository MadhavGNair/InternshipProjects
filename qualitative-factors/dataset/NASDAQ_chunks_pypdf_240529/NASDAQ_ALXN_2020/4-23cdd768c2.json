{"page_content": "5During 2020, we also introduced new \ncapabilities that enable us to conduct key \naspects of our clinical trials remotely, and in \nsome cases, at a patient\u2019s home, making clinical \ntrial participation more accessible to broader \nand more diverse patient communities.\nServing our communities has always been \nintegral to who we are and what we stand  \nfor as an organization, and in 2020, it took  \non an even greater importance. \nSoon after launching in February of last year, \nThe Alexion Charitable Foundation (ACF) made \nits first grants to two leading disease-agnostic \npatient advocacy organizations to support \nCOVID-19 relief efforts for those living with  \nor affected by a rare disease. This response  \nwas soon followed by support for nonprofit \npartners helping our local communities cope \nwith the emotional and financial impacts of  \nthe pandemic. ACF has also since funded \nprograms supporting emotional well-being, \neducational opportunities, and diversity  \nand inclusion. \nAlexion employees also donated more  \nthan 3,400 volunteer hours during Alexion\u2019s \nGlobal Week of Service (GWS). Through  \n100% virtual engagement, our employees  \nsupported emotional well-being, educational \nopportunities, and diversity and inclusion programs that directly impacted the local \ncommunities in which we live and work. \nWe made great strides in creating a more \ndiverse and inclusive culture, focused on \nfostering a deep sense of belonging.\nShortly after I joined Alexion in 2017, we \nembarked on a culture transformation \njourney, and over the last three years, we have \nseen a dramatic increase in a key measure \nof employee loyalty. I believe it is because of \nour strong culture that our employees were \nable to quickly adapt to a new way of working \nand continue serving the patients and \ncommunities who rely on us, uninterrupted. \nNot only did we learn to adapt to a new \nwork environment, but we learned to adapt \nto a new social environment, as well. The \nongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exposed \nmany preexisting health, social and economic \ninequities, sparking conversations and actions \nto address these issues both within our  \nwalls and in our communities. Last summer, \nAlexion appointed its first Chief Diversity \nOfficer to shape and advance diversity, \ninclusion and belonging (DI&B) at Alexion. \nLess than a year later, we have a fully  \ndedicated function focused on enhancing  \nDI&B not only at the employee level, but  \nalso within the rare disease community,  by addressing topics like the historical  \nunderrepresentation of diverse patient \npopulations in clinical trials and persistent \nhealth inequities in treatment.\nWhen I look back on 2020, I am \nincredibly proud of what our organization \naccomplished, despite the challenges \nthat this last year presented. Our recent \nachievements in environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) and CSR ratings are a \nstrong validation that our efforts are having \nan impact. And as I look forward to what is \nahead, I am confident that we will sustain \nthese efforts in order to create a better \nfuture for our generation today and those  \nto follow. \nThank you to the patients and families  \nwho inspire us, our stakeholders who \nsupport us and to our employees for the \ndedication you have shown to patients,  \nto our communities and to each other. \nSincerely,\nLudwig ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALXN_2020.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
