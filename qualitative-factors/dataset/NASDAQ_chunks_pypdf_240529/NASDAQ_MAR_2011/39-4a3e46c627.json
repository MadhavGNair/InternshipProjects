The program focuses on three seafood varieties of \nconcern \u2013 Chilean Sea Bass, Bluefin Tuna, and Shark and \nShark Fin \u2013 and helps our hotels around the world source, \ncook and serve sustainable fish wherever seafood is offered. \nOur portfolio-wide goals include the following:\n zPositively impact the sustainability of the seafood we \npurchase, using informed buying decisions and menus \nwith built-in sustainability zProvide seafood sustainability guidance on a global scale \nthat considers cultural and market uniqueness\n zIdentify and support local sustainable fishing industries \nand practices\nAll hotels received a seafood sustainability guide to assist in \nseafood selection and to help educate associates.  \nRegionally-relevant pocket guides are also provided \nto appropriate associates. The program was rolled out \nenterprisewide in 2010 with a goal of offering 50 percent \nsustainably resourced seafood by 2011, which we exceeded \nby achieving 65 percent sustainable sourcing.\n\u201cWhile there is no single action  \nor cure available for overfished  \nconditions or species at risk, we  \nbelieve that our focus on conservation \nshould drive how our hotels procure, \nprepare and market seafood. We \ncan have a huge impact on how the \nindustry\u2019s suppliers select products to \nsell us, how our chefs select seafood \nfor menus and how our guests respond \nto these efforts.\u201d FutureFish Pocket Guide \nAsia Pacific\n ~Brad Nelson, Vice President of  \nCulinary and Corporate Chef38", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2011.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
