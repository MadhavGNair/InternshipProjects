{"page_content": "The cooking oil waste from our restaurants in several \nregions of the U.S. and U.K. can be recycled into high \nquality biofuel, helping reduce carbon emissions. For \nexample, in 2011 we launched a partnership in the \nU.K. with Convert2Green, a company that collects \nour waste oil and refines it into biodiesel at its plant \nin Cheshire. The fuel is then used to power trucks \nowned by 3663, a Marriott supply chain partner, \nto deliver goods back to Marriott properties. From \nAugust through December, 2011 Marriott U.K. and \nIreland achieved a validated CO2 savings of 20.4 \nmetric tons within its supply chain via this recycling \nprogram. During the first quarter of 2012, the CO2 \nsavings were already 21 metric tons. \nCosta Rica Suppliers  \nProject Update\nIn 2011, Marriott and the World Environment Center \n(WEC), with the support of a grant from the U.S. \nDepartment of State, successfully completed a  \ntwo-year collaboration with six small- to medium-sized Marriott suppliers in Costa Rica, \nranging from a bakery to a wooden \nfurniture maker. The project helped \nthese businesses become more effective \nenvironmental stewards and more \ncompetitive by reducing energy and \nwater consumption, minimizing waste \nand raw material usage and lowering \noperating costs.\nAs a result, participating suppliers  \ncollectively saved the following:\n z1.5 million gallons of drinking water\n z5,801 kWh of electricity\n z1,461 liters of fuel\n z521 tons of solid waste (now being \nused to produce new sub-products)\nOver the duration of the project, the \nsuppliers invested nearly $200,000 in \nmore energy-efficient equipment, realized \nmore than $75,000 in immediate operational cost \nsavings and have forecasted an accumulated annual \nsavings of nearly $300,000 from implementing \nthe action plans. Additionally, the suppliers created \nand hired environmental management staff and \ncreated employee work teams to help drive cleaner \nproduction programs.\nOur chefs are increasingly sourcing local \nand organic foods. Some of our hotels grow \ntheir own herbs and vegetables or maintain \nbeehives. One example is AMP (America\u2019s \nModern Palate) 150, a restaurant in our  \nCleveland Airport Marriott (Ohio) that serves \na garden-focused menu. Chef Jeff Jarrett is \na big supporter of using local products in \nhis dishes to ensure freshness and support \nhis community and the environment. Many \nof his ingredients come from a quarter-acre \ngarden that he planted in a courtyard behind \nthe hotel. \nTurning our used cooking oil into \nbiodiesel fuel is just one more thing we \ncan do for the environment. Testing \nand monitoring the processes ensures \na high grade biodiesel.\n39", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2011.pdf", "page": 40, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
