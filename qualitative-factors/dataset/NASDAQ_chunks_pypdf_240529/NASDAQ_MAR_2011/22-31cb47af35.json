{"page_content": "Diversity Ownership\nMarriott launched the Diversity Ownership Initiative in \n2005 to bridge the gap between successful women and \nminority business owners and professionals and the \nhospitality industry. The Initiative focuses on outreach and \neducation for diverse hotel owners and franchisees and \noffers an array of financial incentives. We surpassed our \nearly goals and by year-end 2011 had 600 open hotels with \ndiverse ownership. \nThis success stems from the following key components of \nMarriott\u2019s Diversity Ownership Initiative:\n zPreparation . We hold education summits for  \nprospective hotel owners and franchisees. Individuals \nlearn about hotel ownership, from concept to  \nexecution, from experienced industry professionals.  \nWorkshops range from partnership development and \nsite location to financing and management.\n zExperience . We seek individuals who have a  \ndemonstrated track record of business experience and \nsuccess. A background in the lodging industry is not \nrequired, but drive is. Individuals must be capable of \ntaking an equity position in Marriott hotels under  \ndevelopment or acquiring or re-branding hotels.\n zEmpowerment.  We equip our owners with information \nand tools they need to be successful. During the  \nworkshops participants meet existing owners,  professionals from the lending industry and members \nof Marriott\u2019s operations team and various departments. \nWe have a network to help guide and support  \nnew owners.\nHuman Rights\nMarriott continues to advance our programs and policies \nthat both respect human rights and protect vulnerable \nchildren.
