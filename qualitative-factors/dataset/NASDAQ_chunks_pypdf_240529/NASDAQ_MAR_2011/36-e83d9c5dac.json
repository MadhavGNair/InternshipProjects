{"page_content": "Marriott continues to be the number one hotel chain in the Clean the World portfolio in terms of the number of hotel rooms \nwith the program implemented. Each day we recycle soaps and bottled amenities in 39,351 Marriott rooms within North \nAmerica, and as of year-end 2011 we had donated nearly 36 tons of these products to those in need through Clean the World.  \nCarbon\nIn May 2012, Marriott rolled out the Green Hotels Global tool, an online environmental sustainability dashboard (developed \nand managed by The Carbon Accounting Company). The system collects data and calculates each hotel\u2019s carbon footprint \naccording to new industry guidelines. It also calculates each hotel\u2019s water footprint and waste diversion rate and maintains a \ncomprehensive list of each hotel\u2019s environmental practices. Green Hotels Global is being phased in globally across Marriott\u2019s \nbrands and will be available on Marriott.com by year-end 2012. \nMarriott continues to proactively address the challenges presented by climate change through our business strategy, internal \npolicies and practices. We demonstrate our environmental leadership by focusing on innovation, collaboration and constructive \nengagement with key stakeholders, delivering results and reporting our progress. We recognize the importance of disclosure \nto our investors and other key stakeholders. Marriott was the first U.S. lodging company to disclose to the Carbon Disclosure \nProject (CDP) in 2006; in 2011, we submitted our first CDP Supply Chain response. We were also the first in our industry to \nprepare a sustainability report using the GRI framework.\n35", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2011.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
