{"page_content": "Immigration and Integration\nMarriott continues to advocate \nfor changes to the U.S. \nimmigration system that would \nimprove our ability to hire \nseasonal immigrant labor for \nperiods and locations where U.S. \ncitizens or permanent residents \nare not filling vacant positions. \nThe U.S. issues a variety of temporary work visas for both \nhigh and low skill occupations \nthat allow noncitizens to enter \nthe country for a period of \ntime to perform certain types \nof work. We remain committed \nto advocating for a uniform \nfederal approach to immigration \nenforcement that will supersede a \ngrowing patchwork of state laws.Communication skills are critical \nto integration and success \nwithin any organization. In 2011, \nthe Migration Policy Institute \nrecognized Marriott with its first-\never Corporate Leadership Award \nfor helping associates expand \ntheir language skills. Marriott\u2019s \nGlobal Language Initiative \nincludes the following programs: \n zSed de Saber\u2122 (Thirst for \nKnowledge), an innovative \nelectronic learning program \nthat enables Spanish-speaking \nassociates and their families \nto learn English at their own \npace and place. \n zRosetta Stone\u00ae, a learning \nprogram that offers courses \nin 25 languages, was further \nexpanded in 2011 through \nMarriott\u2019s intranet. Currently, \nmore than 10,000 associates \nare active in the program. \nIn a recent internal survey, \n97 percent said they would \nrecommend Rosetta Stone  \nto others.\nMy Marriott Hotel\nThrough conversations with Marriott associates around the world, we learned that in some \nareas young people have little exposure, if any, to the hospitality industry. And many have \nnever stayed in a hotel. Through research, we also know that 200 million people, primarily \nages 18 to 34, interact with social games on Facebook each month, a global trend with 70 \npercent of users being outside of the United States. \nTo help generate interest in hospitality careers among young people in growth markets \naround the world, Marriott became the first in our industry to tap into the exploding \npopularity of social media gaming. Our innovative My Marriott Hotel,  launched on Facebook \nin 2011, offers gamers a chance to manage a \u201cvirtual\u201d hotel restaurant kitchen and later on \nmove to other areas of hotel operations. \nThe game can be played in English, Spanish, French, Arabic and Mandarin. The game is also \nbeing prepared to launch on Renren, a channel comparable to Facebook in China, by the end \nof 2012. Gamers create their own restaurant, where they buy equipment and ingredients on \na budget, hire and train staff and serve guests. They earn points for happy customers\u2026and \nlose points for poor service. Ultimately, they are rewarded when their operation turns  \na profit. \nThe response to My Marriott Hotel has been phenomenal. At any given time, we have players \nfrom 120 different countries \u2014 more countries than the 73 where we have hotels \u2014 running \ntheir own kitchens. One-third of My Marriott Hotel game players eventually click on the  \n\u201ctry it for real\u201d button, which directs them to the careers section of our website.\n15", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2011.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
