{"page_content": "During peak periods, such as heat waves, utilities struggle \nto meet demand. To address this issue, Marriott became \nthe first lodging company to join  Constellation Energy\u2019s \nProject Vulcan, a five-year initiative that integrates \nenergy load curtailment during peak demand periods with \nautomated energy management systems enabling hotels to \ntrack electricity usage. For example, hotels may choose to \nlower lighting in common areas, use less air conditioning in \nhallways or unoccupied rooms, or rearrange cooling cycles. \nThe project first launched with U.S. hotels in demand \nresponse markets offering compelling utility incentives; \nother U.S. regions are being phased in.\n2011 results from Project Vulcan include the following:\n z264 of 362 eligible Marriott managed hotels are under \ncontract (up from 141 in 2010)\n z$141,000 or 1.3 million kWh saved annually\n z$292,000 or 268,231 therms saved annually\n z$1.2 million in demand response revenues annually8\nIn 2011, LED lighting retrofit projects in dozens of hotels \nacross Europe and Asia also reduced electricity demand \nand costs. This initiative helps Marriott make progress \ntoward our energy reduction targets, in addition to \nreducing our Scope 2 emissions. Lighting retrofits have \nbeen part of our environmental efforts for years and we \nupgrade systems as newer technology makes lighting more \nenergy efficient.\nAdditionally, all of Marriott\u2019s technology standards, \nincluding those for desktop and notebook computers, are \nboth ENERGY STAR\u00ae rated and EPEAT\u00ae certified.  EPEAT, \nElectronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, is a \ndefinitive global registry for greener electronics. Marriott \nworks closely with our suppliers on the purchase of new \nequipment to ensure we are buying the most  \nenergy-efficient products available, many of which carry \nthe ENERGY STAR label.\nWater\nMarriott launched a partnership with Nalco, a water \ntreatment and process improvement company, to deliver \n450 million gallons in water savings over a three-year \nperiod from 2010 to 2012. Nalco\u2019s monitoring equipment \nand innovative water treatment chemistry, deployed to \n168 of our full-service hotels worldwide, help optimize \nthe water treatment in the hotels\u2019 chillers and cooling \ntowers. We continue to expand the program into additional \nproperties. Based on current program participation, we \nexpect that savings will include at least 125 million gallons \nof water per year.Working together, Nalco and Marriott saved 16 million \ngallons of fresh water annually at Marriott\u2019s Renaissance \nMumbai Convention Centre Hotel by using recycled water \nin the hotel\u2019s cooling system. That represents 256 million \nglasses of cool, fresh drinking water \u2014 or the equivalent of \n18 glasses for each man, woman and child in Mumbai, the \nsecond largest city in the world.\nIn 2011, Marriott implemented improved dishwashing \nsystems and supplies at properties in the U.S., bringing \nthe total number of full-service properties using these \nsystems to 153. Ecolab\u2019s APEX monitoring systems and \nconcentrated detergent formulations help reduce energy \nand water use and waste by improving operational \nefficiency. We estimate that participating properties have \nrealized 4,200 fewer pounds of plastic waste, 4.25 million \ngallons of water conserved, 2.2 million kWh of energy \nsaved, and 135,000 therms of natural gas reduced.\nMarriott reports annually to \nthe Carbon Disclosure Project \nwww.cdproject.net\nCarbon performance band\nCarbon disclosure score\nNote:  Performance rated from A to E with A \nbeing highest.\nDisclosure rated 100-point normalized scale.B\n642010 2011\nB\n70\n8 Utility companies like Constellation Energy pay participants who reduce their energy demand during periods of peak load.  33", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2011.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
