{"page_content": "Energy/Water/Waste/  \nCarbon\nMarriott has an integrated global \nenvironmental strategy that improves energy \nefficiency, conserves water, builds more \nsustainable hotels and supports high-level \nprojects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nWe have established a variety of programs and \ntools to help us meet our sustainability goals.\nWe continue to pursue initiatives and \ncollaborative efforts with property owners and \nindustry peers and groups, and have already \nrecorded progress toward our 2020 targets. \nFor example, since 2007 we have reduced \nour water consumption by 11.6 percent per \noccupied room and energy consumption by 4.1 \npercent per square meter of conditioned space. \nIn this section we highlight some of our recent \ninitiatives to meet our goal of reducing energy \nand water consumption by 20 percent by 2020.\nEnergy\nTo help engineering and other property leaders \naccomplish energy and water reduction goals, \nMarriott developed Energy and Environmental \nAction Plans (EEAP), a comprehensive, best \npractice audit tool. The EEAP covers a range of \nitems from corporate re-use policies to simple \nbest practice behaviors for lighting; appliance; \nheating, ventilation and air conditioning \n(HVAC); and central plant conservation and \nefficiency. EEAP links the calculations to \neach audit point to assist the properties with \nassigning an energy unit and dollar value to \neach behavior change or project.\nIn our most recent 2011 EEAP submission, our \nproperty teams loaded over 3,200 energy and \nenvironmental action items worth 505 million \nkWh, 4 million therms and 281 million gallons \nof water reductions into the database. While \nwe do not expect every one of these property \nplans will be achieved, we believe that this \nfocus on efficiency and conservation reduces \nour environmental impact and costs. Following \nthe successful rollout to full-service hotels \nin the Americas in 2011, we have scheduled \nEEAPs for deployment to the remaining three \ncontinental divisions in 2012.Environmental Performance Indicators*   \nrevised 9/19/12\n2007 2010 2011Change from \n2010\nTotal Water Consumption  \n(million cubic meters)58.6 51.7 53.2 2.9%\nIntensitya0.86 0.77 0.76 -1.3%\nTotal Energy in megawatt hours  \n(million MWh)5.36 6.54 6.45 -1.4%\nIntensityb345.2 335.4 331.2 -1.3%\nDirect Energy (million MWh) 2.34 2.57 2.56e-0.4%\nIndirect (Purchased) Energy  \n(million MWh)3.02 3.97 3.89e-2.0%\nGHG Emissions (million tons CO2e)c2.16 2.81 2.80 -0.4%\nIntensityd310.3 322.9 321.6 -0.4%\na - cubic meter per occupied room   b - kWh per square meter of conditioned space  c - Scope 1 and 2  \nd - lbs. per square meter conditioned space  e - 2011 Direct and Indirect energy totals were 9.22 million \ngigajoules (GJ) and 14.00 million GJ, respectively\n*This table includes results for all managed properties.
