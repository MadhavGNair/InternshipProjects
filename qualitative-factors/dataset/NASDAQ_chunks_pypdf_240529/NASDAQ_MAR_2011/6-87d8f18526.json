{"page_content": "Sourcing sustainable seafood \nthrough FutureFish\nIn 2010, working with vendors, global \nand local fisheries, and organizations \nsuch as Cleanfish, Marine  \nStewardship Council and FishWatch, \nMarriott became the first large global \nhotel company to launch a \nsustainable seafood initiative that we \ncall FutureFish. Designed by our  \ncorporate culinary team, this  \nprogram helps associates in our hotels \naround the world source, prepare \nand serve sustainable fish wherever \nseafood is offered (see page 38). The \nprogram was rolled out enterprisewide \nin 2010, with a goal of offering 50 \npercent sustainably resourced seafood \nby 2011. Today, approximately 65 \npercent of seafood sourced at Marriott \nhotels is caught in a sustainable \nmanner.  We have also engaged \nseafood vendors, such as Santa Monica \nSeafood (California) and M&J Seafood \n(U.K.), in tracking and reporting \non their invoices the percentage \nof products purchased under the \nsustainable seafood program.\nAdvocating for the New Golden \nAge of Travel\nOver the past decade, according to the \nU.S. Travel Association, the  \nnumber of individuals traveling  \ninternationally increased by 60  \nmillion, while the number of  \ninternational visitors to the U.S. \nremained essentially flat. Marriott \nhas remained steadfast in advocating \nfor policy measures that will help us \ncapture a greater share of the  \ngrowing global travel market. The \ngrowth of middle classes in countries \nsuch as Brazil, India and China has the \npotential to spur a \u201cNew Golden Age of \nTravel,\u201d boosting U.S. job growth and \nprosperity. \nIn 2010, the Travel Promotion Act \nwas signed into law, resulting in the \ncreation of \u201cBrand USA,\u201d the  \nfirst-ever public-private partnership \ncharged with marketing the United \nStates as an international travel  destination. In 2011, Marriott  \ncommitted $3 million to this  \ncampaign in cash and in-kind  \ncontributions. We also continue to \nwork with the U.S. Department of \nState, U.S. Department of Commerce \nand U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity to reform visa and entry \nsystems, reducing wait times for visa \ninterviews at consular offices  \nworldwide to welcome more visitors.\nlearn more\nVisit https://www\n.com for:- More detailed information\n about these recommendations\n-  Recommendations for seafood\nnot on this list\n-  The latest version of this and\n other regional guides\n-  Information on seafood and \n your health and much more...\n\u00a9 2010.
