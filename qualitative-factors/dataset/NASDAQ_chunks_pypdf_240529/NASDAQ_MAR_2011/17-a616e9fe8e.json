{"page_content": "Learning and Development\nTo meet the demands of  \nMarriott\u2019s global growth strategy, \nit is important to develop a strong \nleadership pipeline to ensure \nassociates are ready to assume \nadvanced leadership roles. \nThrough skills training programs, \nprofessional development \nopportunities and other learning \nexperiences, we provide associates \nwith a multitude of choices for \ncareer and personal growth, \nincluding over 4,500 formal \nlearning programs. Of these, more \nthan three-fourths are eLearning, \nwith the balance being instructor-led or blended programs. Marriott \nassociates also participate in \ninformal learning activities \nthroughout the year.\nOne example of a formal learning \nprogram is our Breakthrough \nLeadership Training based on \nFranklinCovey\u2019s The 4 Disciplines \nof Execution. The program helps \nmanagers create, execute and \nmeasure critical work goals aligned \nwith Marriott\u2019s business priorities. \nIn 2011, Marriott completed the \nroll-out of this program to U.S. \nhotel and sales managers and \nlaunched the program\u2019s global \nexpansion to specifically drive overall guest satisfaction. To \nensure ongoing success of the \nprogram, managers have access \nto best practices sharing and \ncoaching, including weekly \ncoach calls and quarterly web-\nbased program update sessions. \nSince introducing Breakthrough \nLeadership Training, Marriott\u2019s \nGuest Satisfaction Scores (see \npage 22) for \u201cstaff service\u201d and \n\u201carrival experience\u201d in North \nAmerica and the Caribbean/Latin \nAmerica have increased in the \nrange of 1.2 to 3.3 percentage \npoints in just two years.\nUnder Marriott\u2019s philosophy of \npromoting from within, many \nof our leaders have moved \nup from entry-level hourly or \nmanagement positions. In addition \nto participating in internal \nlearning programs, these leaders \nhave taken advantage of tuition \nreimbursement and flexible \nschedules to attend school;  \ncross-training to gain experience \nand skills in various departments; \nand work-at-home options. \nIn addition to associates who \nwere promoted into supervisory \nor management jobs in 2011, \nthousands more moved laterally, \ngaining new career experiences.\nIn 2011, we launched a new \nHourly Performance Process \n(HPP), developed with input \nfrom managers, to support the \nevaluation of hourly associates on \nactivities that are most important \nto their jobs, with an added focus \non their professional development. \nReviews are conducted with all \nassociates on an annual basis.  \nPerformance development is \norganized using the HPP tool and \nis accomplished through ongoing \nconversation between associates \nand their managers.\nAwards of Excellence Spotlight \nIn 2011, Marriott celebrated the 25th anniversary of our Awards of Excellence. The highest \naward presented annually to honor associates for outstanding service is the  \nJ. Willard Marriott Award of Excellence. \nOne of the award recipients was Hassan Ibrahim, a Prep Cook at the Dallas Marriott Suites \n(Texas), who began as a dishwasher in 2005.  \nHassan emigrated from Sudan to the U.S. after experiencing unrest in his home city of \nDarfur. He views challenges as opportunities rather than obstacles. When Hassan realized \nthe need to learn English, he signed up for courses at a local school. With Hassan\u2019s help, \nthe hotel\u2019s Guest Services Satisfaction scores have ranked as high as number one and the \nkitchen\u2019s Engagement Survey scores have increased 20 percent since 2009. \n\u201cHassan really is the American dream,\u201d says Suzy Hart, general manager of the Dallas \nMarriott Suites. \u201cThe love he has for our company is like nothing I have seen before. Hassan \nprobably believes that Marriott is a great company as much as Mr. Marriott does.\u201d16", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2011.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
