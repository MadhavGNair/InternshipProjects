The Code and the \nPolicy Statements set forth standards for making decisions \nconsistent with our regulatory and ethical frameworks and \ngovern the way we conduct business (Compliance Program).  \n Policy Against Discrimination and \nHarassment  \nContained within our Code, we have a separate policy \nthat specifically addresses our commitment to providing a \nworkspace that is free of harassing and offensive behavior. \nOur policy states that all of our employment related decisions \nare made based on an individual\u2019s job qualifications and \nperformance and not based on any characteristic protected \nby law like race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, \nancestry, disability, age, genetic information, citizenship \nstatus, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, affectional \nor sexual orientation, atypical cellular or blood trait, marital \nstatus, veteran status or membership in the armed services. \nWe also state that harassment based on these, or other, \nprotected characteristics is strictly prohibited and will not \nbe tolerated. Through our \u201cWhistleblower Program,\u201d we \nencourage our employees to report questionable conduct by \ncalling our dedicated compliance hotline number.  \n All of our activities must be managed in full compliance with \nthe Code and all applicable legal and regulatory anti-bribery \nand corruption obligations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt \nPractices Act, The U.K. Bribery Act and the Ireland Criminal \nJustice (Corruption Offenses) Act of 2018.  \n \nGovernance Practices  \nOverall responsibility for the functioning of Arch\u2019s Compliance \nProgram has been assigned to our CFO who, by appointment \nby our Board, functions as our Director of Compliance. \nReporting to the Director of Compliance are 13 Group \nCompliance Officers representing each of our operating \ngroups.

Because we operate \nin many jurisdictions, we periodically (at least annually) \nconduct comprehensive reviews across these jurisdictions to \nensure new developments are considered and incorporated \nas appropriate.
