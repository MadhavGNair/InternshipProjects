OUR INVESTING\nWe are responsible for investing and managing the assets of our affiliates around the \nworld. Through our investment management activities we preserve and protect over \n$25 billion in assets (at December 31, 2020).   \n \nOur investment approach seeks to enhance the company\u2019s return on equity while \navoiding undue risk. We achieve this by investing the vast majority of our portfolio \nin investment grade fixed income securities, with modest allocations to high yield, \nequities and alternatives. We focus on total return rather than nominal yield and \nwe generally attempt to match, within a reasonable range, the duration of our \ninvestments to the duration of our liabilities. As careful stewards of the capital \nentrusted to us, we manage the portfolio conservatively, securing our reserves and \nensuring an ongoing ability to pay claims when due.  \n \nWe believe the incorporation of material, nonfinancial factors into investment selection \nand risk management has the potential to enhance long-term investment returns. 2020 Highlights", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACGL_2020.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
