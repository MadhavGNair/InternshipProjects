{"page_content": "2020 ESG ANNUAL REPORT  |   19 \n Our People Our Operations Our Business Our Investing Our Communities\nOversight of Our Compliance Program  \nOur Board\u2019s Audit Committee oversees the implementation \nand effectiveness of the Compliance Program. The Compliance \nDirector is responsible for overall monitoring, auditing and \nevaluation of the Compliance Program. The Audit Committee \nperiodically meets (at least annually) with the Compliance \nDirector and in-house auditors to ensure compliance.  \n \nTogether with our general counsel (GC), the Compliance \nDirector reports to and meets with the Audit Committee at \nleast annually to provide reports, including reports from \nthe Group Compliance Officers, on the implementation \nand effectiveness of the Compliance Program and its \nadministration, training, monitoring and auditing. The \nCompliance Director also periodically advises the Audit \nCommittee of any deficiencies in the Compliance Program \nand recommends improvements as necessary.  \n The Compliance Hotline and  \nMonitoring Calls  \nEmployees with questions or concerns are encouraged to \nconsult with their Group Compliance Officers or to take \nadvantage of our \u201cCompliance Hotline.\u201d The Compliance \nProgram is crucial to building an environment in which all \nemployees are fully cognizant of the standards of conduct \nthey must meet and are confident they can ask questions \nor report violations or suspected violations without fear of \nretribution. The Compliance Hotline numbers are published \nin our Code and reinforced through memos that accompany \nupdates to the Code that are distributed to all employees. The \nphone numbers are also readily available on our company \nintranet site. \n \nCalls to the Compliance Hotline are answered by a live \noperator and callers can be anonymous. The Compliance \nHotline is monitored by the Compliance Director, the GC and \nthe deputy GC, who receive email notification of any reported \nmatter(s). When notified, the Compliance Director determines \nwhether the allegations are sufficiently serious to require \nthat the Audit Committee be notified immediately and, if so, \nadvises the Audit Committee of the problem and the steps \nbeing taken to address the matter. Matters are promptly \nreferred to the appropriate Group Compliance Officer for \nevaluation. So long as reports are made in good faith, the \nevaluation procedures emphasize we will protect employees \nfrom negative consequences resulting from fulfilling their \nreporting obligations and protect their identities. The Audit \nCommittee is provided with a quarterly report regarding the \nCompliance Program. Our GC monitors the investigations and \nkeeps the Audit Committee informed.
