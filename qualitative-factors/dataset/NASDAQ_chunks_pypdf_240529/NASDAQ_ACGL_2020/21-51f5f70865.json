Upon request, \nSuppliers understand that they must be able to provide \nproof of compliance.  \n \nDuring 2021, we plan to evaluate and engage with some of \nour largest suppliers to get a better understanding of their \npolicies around sustainability. Through this process we can \nassess their compliance with our Supplier Code and discuss \nour ongoing relationship from a strategic perspective. We\u2019ll \nuse the information obtained to guide and inform our \nongoing relationship.  \n \nNew Technology Solution  \nTo further inform us and to help us build a responsible \nsupply chain program, we engaged a technology solutions \nprovider to apply its market intelligence around our \ncurrent and prospective Suppliers\u2019 sustainability practices. \nTheir tool includes ratings by third-party sustainability \nrating agencies. Our expectation is that through this \nsoftware we\u2019re able to better assess our current Suppliers\u2019 \nsustainability practices and add sustainable practices more \nformally to our selection process for future suppliers.  \n In the interest of working with suppliers that adhere to the same ethical standards as \nArch, we launched in 2020 a Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) that sets forth our \nexpectations for suppliers providing goods or services. We are committed to engaging \nwith contractors, consultants, suppliers and vendors with the highest level of integrity to \nsupport our long-term growth and add value to our company.\nView our Supplier Code > >\nView our Human Rights Policy > >", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACGL_2020.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
