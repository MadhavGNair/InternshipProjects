Customers were invited to \ndecide the recipients and more than 300 votes were cast, \nultimately selecting four nonprofits impacting children, food \nscarcity, mental health and the homeless. \nThe giving extended to the \nholidays, when Arch sent cards \ninviting customers to help select \nnonprofits to receive an Arch \ndonation in lieu of customer gifts. \nCustomers were enthusiastic and \nnearly 1,800 voted, directing Arch \nto give more than $20,000 to charities including Feeding \nAmerica in the U.S. and the Red Cross in Canada.Housing\nAside from the intrinsic value our mortgage insurance \nbusiness provides to the housing market, we partner with \nkey charities to connect individuals and families with safe, \npermanent housing solutions.
