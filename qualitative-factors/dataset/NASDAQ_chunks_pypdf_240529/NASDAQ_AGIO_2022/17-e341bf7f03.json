{"page_content": "ESG Report 2023\nPediatric PK Deficiency Trial Design\nAgios initiated our first pediatric clinical program in mid-2022, \ndesigned to evaluate the first potential treatment for children born with PK deficiency, a rare blood disorder. In order to ensure that the clinical trial program would evaluate the symptoms of greatest importance to this community, and to ensure that the trial protocol would be as easy for participants as possible, we involved caregivers of PK deficiency patients in the design of our trials. We met with a group of caregivers while developing the study protocol, and their feedback guided several key decisions. For example, we learned that swallowing pills may be challenging for some older children, so we built into the protocol the option to ingest the pills as \u201csprinkles.\u201d In addition, we heard from caregivers that a certain series of tests \u2014 which we had believed \nmight be burdensome for patients but which would provide \nvaluable information on the medication\u2019s safety and efficacy \n \u2014 were in fact considered routine by most patients and \ncaregivers, and would therefore not be burdensome to \ninclude in our protocol. Case Study \nPatient Voice in Clinical Trials\nPatients are the true experts in their disease experience, and their partnership in clinical trials is essential for developing meaningful new \ninnovations. Agios strives for patient voices to be central when developing clinical trial protocols and creating communications for trial participants. By seeking input from patients early on, and incorporating their feedback, our trials are better equipped to address the aspects of the disease that are most important to patients, and are more inclusive and accommodating of patients' needs which paves the way for more representative diversity in our trials.\nRISE UP Sickle Cell Disease  \nTrial Recruiting Campaign\nFor years, we have partnered closely with sickle cell \nwarriors from around the world to design a clinical trial that \nis created by sickle cell warriors, for sickle cell warriors. This included developing the study protocol, the trial branding and recruitment campaign for our RISE UP study, a Phase 2/3 study in sickle cell disease. These warriors spent months working with us, sharing their voice that set the direction for the project, brainstorming study branding and providing input on the recruitment campaign materials. Importantly, they are also the face of the campaign. Our hope was to together create something that would be meaningful to the community and represent their resilience in the face of challenges, refusal to settle for the status quo, and influential efforts to educate the world about sickle cell and close the equality gap in healthcare. While the RISE UP study is sponsored by Agios, it is also a study created for and by the sickle cell community. We view this study as a pilot initiative and plan to take lessons learned to inform our approach to recruit more representative populations in future clinical trials as well.  \nBlaze, living with sickle cell disease\nTeonna, living with \nsickle cell disease\nRemy, living with PK deficiency, \nand her mom Becky18", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGIO_2022.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
