The health and safety of our employees \nremains paramount, and I am proud of how our team continued to do its part to keep family, friends, fellow employees \nand communities safe. We maintained productivity, focused on our internal and external customers and delivered 16% \nyear-over-year growth in Qorvo revenue. We continue to expand our product and technology leadership, and we have \nmade outstanding progress in our annual goals to reduce our environmental footprint.  \nStrong demand for Qorvo products and technology which connect, protect and power the world around us drove \nour growth in our fiscal 2022.  Qorvo technology is at the heart of products and systems that enable 5G and Wi-Fi \nnetworks and mobile devices, power-efficient internet-of-things products and make the \u201cconnected car\u201d a reality \nthrough vehicle-to-everything technology.  We also expanded our product offering with the acquisition of NextInput, \nadding micro-electromechanical touch sensors that convert human touch into action.\nThis past year, we grew our customer offerings for key products and applications that highlight energy efficiency and \nhelp power the planet.  Through our acquisition of United Silicon Carbide, we increased product offerings that support \nsustainability, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy.  Our power management and silicon carbide power \nsolutions are bringing unmatched levels of efficiency to a new generation of automotive, smart appliances, solid-state \ndrives, battery-operated tools and renewable energy systems.  Qorvo is well positioned to help accelerate the global shift \nto electrification, where high-efficiency, sustainable energy is key to a cleaner and brighter future.\nOne of the most important facets of the semiconductor industry is the need for a strong global supply  \nchain, which has only been reinforced by the ongoing pandemic.  Qorvo maintains strong and  \npositive relationships with our key external suppliers.  Our teams actively monitor our supply  \nchain to maintain compliance with laws, regulations and initiatives around product compliance,  \nresponsible sourcing and social responsibility.
