However, current stress testing results do not include ESG considerations or scenarios.  Amerant uses macro-economic scenarios provided annually by the Federal Reserve for the CCAR process  to assess its portfolio to determine the expected losses over 9 quarters and therefore the impact to capital. \nIncorporation of ESG stress tests will be considered in the \n2022 capacity-building plan that supports our ESG strategy.\nActivity Metrics\nCode Metric Reporting Response\nFN-CB-000.A (1) Number and (2) value of checking and savings accounts by segment:          (a) personal           (b) small business\nFN-CB-000.B (1) Number and (2) value of loans by segment:          (a) personal         (b) small business\n         (c) corporate\nPersonal Checking accounts\nSmall Business Checking accounts\nPersonal Savings accountsSmall Business Savings accounts47,906\n3,786\n14,230\n411,419,840,998\n134,531,252\n316,318,620\n2,094,693                 N umber                   Value (Amount $)\nLoan for Personal* (Exclude \nMortgage or Revolving Credit)\nLoan for Small Business (Exclude \nMortgage or Revolving Credit)\nLoan for Corporate (Exclude \nMortgage or Revolving Credit)3,097\n509\n352540,569,769\n52,774,818\n853,621,117                 N umber                   Value (Amount $)\nPartially Reporting Not Reporting Fully Reporting\n* Inlcudes loans purchased from SoFi.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMTBB_2021.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
