Amerant built community goodwill as one of the few We helped customers navigate the pandemic\nWhen COVID-19 struck, we took steps to mitigate the impact on our customers.  At \nthe onset of the pandemic, we temporarily eliminated Amerant ATM fees, waived \nlate payment fees on business and consumer loans, and refrained from reporting \nnegative information to credit bureaus for past-due loan balances held by Amerant, \namong other individualized account measures.\nAs the pandemic presented an unprecedented level of economic uncertainty, we \nclosely monitored and managed credit risk, identifying and contacting our clients \nmost susceptible to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis systematic and compassionate approach resulted in loan modifications that \nsimultaneously contributed to managing Amerant\u2019s portfolio risk.\nMeasures to support our customers and their \nbusinesses during the pandemic included \ncontinuous monitoring of the loan portfolio \nto allow us to remain agile while supporting \nour customers in a quickly changing and \nuncertain scenario.\n*These numbers have not been qualified by the Bank Examiners as of the date of this report.\n** These numbers include PPP loans.Building up our communities\nbanks that helped small businesses who were non-customers \nacquire PPP loans.
