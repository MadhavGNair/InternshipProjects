It\u2019s essential \nto know what our team members, \ncustomers, investors, and community \npartners say about how we\u2019re doing.\nInternally, an annual engagement \nsurvey takes the pulse of employee \nopinions and experiences, delving \ninto both the work environment and \nmanagement culture. \nExternally, measuring customer \nsatisfaction is a vital feedback link. \nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is an \nindex ranging from -100 to 100 that \nmeasures the willingness of customers \nto recommend a company\u2019s products \nor services to others. Amerant created a \ndedicated unit to review this customer \nfeedback. The goal is to identify areas of \nfriction in customer service processes so they can be addressed and improved.\nIn the community, the presence \nof Amerant team members and \nexecutives in civic organizations and \non philanthropic boards provides \na valuable conduit for information \nsharing. Amerant is at the table and \nin the field to hear about needs and \nsee them up close, enabling us to \nbe responsive and strategic in our \ncommunity engagement efforts.\nWe also seek to join the dialogue about \ntransitioning our communities toward a \nmore sustainable future. There is a wide \ncontinuum of opinion and advocacy \nin this endeavor, from conservation \ngroups to real estate developers to \ngovernmental agencies. This presents \nthe opportunity for representatives \nfrom Amerant to play a role in helping \nour communities achieve practical and \nethical balance.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMTBB_2021.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
