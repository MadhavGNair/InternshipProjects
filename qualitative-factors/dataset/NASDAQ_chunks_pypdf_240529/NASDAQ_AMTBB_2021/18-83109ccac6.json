And Amerant \npeople have extraordinary ability. \nOperating through the pandemic taught us that it was our \npeople, largely working in hybrid schedules or fully remote, who enabled us to operate smoothly and continuously to serve our customers and aid the community during an extended crisis.\nWith a team like this, it\u2019s imperative that we extend every \nopportunity to help them grow and learn and find personal and financial fulfillment.\nThat\u2019s what this pillar is all about.\nBuilding on a record  of achievement\nAmerant is well past the starting line in our effort to empower our people. Programs for the development \nand well-being of employees are long-established and will continue to expand as empowerment initiatives unfold.

It\u2019s about making sure everyone\u2019s voice is heard.  And it\u2019s about making sure we reflect the communities we serve. To walk the talk, we identified specific actions to promote inclusive behaviors amongst all team members.\nIn one specific example, we are a 20-year \nchampion of targeted development programs for underrepresented talent in partnership with the \n\u201cAmerant\u2019s D&I objective is to build high-performing teams that are reflective of the diverse \ncommunities we serve.\u201d  \n                                - Jerry Plush\nCenter for Financial Training, a local chapter of \nthe American Bankers Association.\nTo this end, we named a new Chief Diversity \nOfficer, Kristy Amaro, and also formed a cross-functional diversity ambassador team.  The new team created the compelling \u201cI Belong\u201d program \nto raise the profile of diversity and inclusion and encourage awareness organization-wide.\nIn another important action, we conducted \nan analysis of  workforce data, identified underrepresented talent segments, and goals were set to close representation gaps.Diversity, Equity, and InclusionSNAPSHOT:  2022 TARGETS AND BEYOND\nTeam diversity\n\u2022 Actively work to hire locally by partnering with government employment agencies, \nnonprofit partners, and universities.\n\u2022 Strengthen diversity in the hiring pipeline by ensuring diverse candidate pools and diverse selection teams.\n\u2022 Partner with new vendors to offer diversity and inclusion learning activities.\n\u2022 Add inclusive behaviors to the competency model and educate on these behaviors.\nAwareness and growth\n\u2022 In alignment with our goals of increasing representation of women in leadership and to \nfoster inclusion for underrepresented groups we plan to launch Team Member Resource \nGroups in 2022 - the first a group dedicated to Women in Finance.\n\u2022 Exploring actions such as developing career paths for all our team members, assessing \npotential expansions of our Family Leave policy, and implementing a permanent hybrid \nworking schedule option for specific roles. \n\u2022 Engage a third party to conduct a fair pay compensation assessment.
