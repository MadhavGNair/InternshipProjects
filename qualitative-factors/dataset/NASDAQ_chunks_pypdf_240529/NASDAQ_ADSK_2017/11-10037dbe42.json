Many of our facilities offer gyms and walking desks, and our wellness campaign \nincludes events such as softball, basketball, and \nsoccer tournaments. We also have programs to improve safety at our workshops and facilities worldwide and offer employees a voluntary \nprogram to help reduce ergonomic risks.\nRestructuring: In light of an anticipated decrease \nin revenue and a commitment to manage spending, \nAutodesk implemented a worldwide restructuring plan in fiscal year 2017. This enables us to rebalance staffing levels to better align with the evolving \nneeds of the business and reduce operating \nexpenses.
