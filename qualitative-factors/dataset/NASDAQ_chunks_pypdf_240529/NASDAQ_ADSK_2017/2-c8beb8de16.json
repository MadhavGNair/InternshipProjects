Although our biggest opportunity to improve our shared future is through the designers who use our software, we also work hard to improve the direct impact of  \nour operations. This report provides a high-level view of our progress in sustainability over the past several years.\nEconomy\nAutodesk\u2019s ongoing financial performance underpins the company\u2019s efforts in sustainability. Our business model has shifted away from one-time, perpetual licenses toward term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business agreements. Over time, this business model transition will result in a more predictable, recurring, and profitable business. However, during the transition, traditional financial \nmetrics, such as revenue, margins, earnings per share, and cash flow from operations will be adversely impacted. This is primarily due to revenue \nfor new subscription offerings being recognized over time rather than up front and because subscription offerings generally have a lower initial price than perpetual offerings.\n FY2017\nPerformance data FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\nRevenue [million US$] $2,312 $2,274 $2,512 $2,504 $2,031 $512 $551 $490 $479\nGAAP gross profit [million US$] $2,074 $2,000 $2,170 $2,133 $1,689 $419 $466 $408 $396\nGAAP net income [million US$] $248 $229 $82 ($331) ($579) ($168) ($98) ($143) ($171)\nGAAP diluted earnings per share [US$] $1.07 $1.00 $0.35 ($1.46) ($2.60) ($0.77) ($0.44) ($0.64) ($0.77)\nRelative contribution to world GDP  \n[million US$ contribution/trillion US$ world GDP]29.1 27.0 28.1 29.2 23.1 22.3 24.8 21.7 21.1", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2017.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
