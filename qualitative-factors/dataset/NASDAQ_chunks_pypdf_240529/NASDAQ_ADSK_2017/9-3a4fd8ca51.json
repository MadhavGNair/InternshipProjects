Data are extrapolated to our full real estate portfolio based on sites where data are available.\nWater\nWater is not a material issue for our operations. However, we recognize that fresh water scarcity is an increasing risk globally, largely due to the impacts of climate change. We reduce water use in many of  \nour offices and data centers through right-sized cooling equipment, efficient fixtures and toilets,  \nand conservation.\nCorporate environmental management\nAutodesk\u2019s Environmental Policy outlines our high-level sustainability commitments. Our Environmental Core Team (see graphic), which includes senior leaders from across the business, champions this policy. Project teams support this effort by obtaining environmental data, making investment decisions, \nimplementing measures to reduce our impact, and reporting performance. These groups are co-led by the \nCorporate Sustainability Team and Autodesk employees from each activity area. All Autodesk locations are covered by the company\u2019s environmental management system.\nEnvironmental compliance\nAutodesk meets or exceeds all applicable environmental laws and regulations related to our business operations. In fiscal year 2017, we were not cited or fined for noncompliance of any environmental laws  \nor regulations.\nPerformance data FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017\nEnvironmental violations 0 0 0 0 0\nEnvironmental fines [US$] $0 $0 $0 $0 $0Autodesk environmental management structure\nCEO Staff\nCorporate  \nSustainability  \nTeamEnvironmental Core Team\nTravel  \nProject  \nTeamFacilities \nProject  \nTeamEvents  \nProject  \nTeamIT Project  \nTeamSupply Chain Project  \nTeam\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2017.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
