{"page_content": "5Products\nAddressing the global threat of climate change requires action across sectors and geographies. When we \nlook to the future of making things, it\u2019s imperative that it be low-carbon. Sustainable design can have a real, lasting effect in our collective efforts to move toward that future by helping to reduce the GHG emissions \nand environmental impact of buildings, infrastructure, and manufactured goods. \nThe architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) and manufacturing sectors account for two-thirds  \nof the world\u2019s carbon emissions.\n1 The rate of new construction in the United States alone is equivalent to \nbuilding a new Manhattan every 35 days.2 And in 2014, the value of U.S. manufacturing was enough to \nmake it the ninth largest economy in the world, valued at $2.1 trillion.3 The opportunity to transform our \nworld through sustainable design is immense, and Autodesk\u2019s customers are looking for ways to design \nand manufacture more sustainable buildings, infrastructure projects, and products. In fact, an Autodesk-\ncommissioned study from Deloitte revealed that by 2020, 75 percent of the market we serve will demand \nsoftware tools that help advance sustainable design.\nOur customers have a broad and global reach. They include a wide range of companies, established design \nfirms, academic institutions, nonprofits, and entrepreneurs in the AEC, product design, and manufacturing fields. We develop solutions that our customers can use to design a future in which our built environment, infrastructure, products, and manufacturing can allow us all to live well, and live within the limits of the \nplanet. We help customers proactively understand, optimize, and improve the environmental performance \nof everything they make, so they can advance their carbon, energy, resource productivity, and cost savings goals.\nArchitecture, engineering, and construction: Our customers use Autodesk\n\u00ae tools to design and retrofit \nbuildings; maximize energy and material efficiency; prioritize infrastructure projects based on social, \nenvironmental, and economic impacts; and minimize waste during construction. Our suite of solutions  \nfor the AEC sector includes industry-leading products that enable sustainable design choices. \nAutodesk\u00ae Revit\u00ae, InfraWorks\u00ae 360, AutoCAD\u00ae Civil 3D\u00ae, BIM 360\u00ae, CFD, FormIt\u00ae 360 Pro, Insight, Navisworks\u00ae, and \nRobot\u2122 Structural Analysis Professional software\nBuilding design and retrofit \u2022 Design high-performance buildings\n\u2022 Conduct energy analysis from concept through complex modeling \n\u2022 Prioritize retrofits across property portfolios and locations \n\u2022 Use structural materials efficiently\n\u2022 Plan for smart decommissioning of buildings and related material recovery\nInfrastructure \u2022 Prioritize projects based on social, environmental, and economic impacts\n\u2022 Manage bioretention and green stormwater\n\u2022 Conduct traffic impact analysis\n\u2022 Conduct pollution modeling\nConstruction \u2022 Minimize waste during construction\n\u2022 Plan for offsite and prefabrication design\nModel courtesy of DesignGroup and the National Audubon Society.\n1.
