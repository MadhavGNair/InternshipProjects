Historical values for total GHG emissions, GHG emissions intensity, and carbon offsets as a percent of GHG emissions are updated due to revisions to business travel data, as described in footnote 9.\n6. Beginning with fiscal year 2015, data are calculated with the market-based accounting method, which takes into account purchased renewable energy. Data for prior years use a location-based methodology to calculate \nGHG emissions.\n7. These data are calculated based on the economic input-output lifecycle assessment model, using industry-specific emissions factors in conjunction with Autodesk\u2019s spend.\n8. Data for \"capital goods\" and \"transportation and distribution\" were calculated based on annual spend and allocated evenly across quarters.\n9. We updated our methodology for calculating GHG emissions associated with business travel to more accurately capture the effects of radiative forcing. Historical data have been restated accordingly.\n10. LEED certifications as of January 31, 2017, include facilities in Beijing, China (Interior Design and Construction: Commercial Interiors [CI] Platinum), Shanghai, China (CI Gold), Mumbai, India (CI Platinum),  \nTel Aviv, Israel (CI Platinum), Milan, Italy (CI Gold), Singapore (CI Platinum), Farnborough, United Kingdom (CI Gold), and the following in the United States: San Francisco, California (CI Platinum [4]);  \nSan Rafael, California (CI Certified [1], CI Platinum [3]); Lake Oswego, Oregon (CI Certified).", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2017.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
