During fiscal \nyear 2017 and in the months following, we made \nimportant strides in these areas. Even as we face challenges ahead, Autodesk remains optimistic \nabout the future and committed to our role in \nadvancing progress.

In March 2017 , our \nthen co-CEOs released a statement in response to the U.S. administration\u2019s proposed budget cuts to \nclimate and environmental programs. They followed \nthis with another statement in June 2017 to reiterate our commitment to the Paris Agreement.

We called on the state of North Carolina to repeal this law that would result in limiting opportunity to a group based on difference.\nIn early 2017, Autodesk joined the public debate  \nin the U.S. regarding immigration. Our former CEO, \nCarl Bass, sent a message to our entire staff, letting them know that our company did not support the president\u2019s January 27, 2017, executive order on immigration and affirming Autodesk\u2019s commitment \nto diversity and our support of all employees. We \nalso released this statement publicly and followed it up by joining more than 120 companies (most of them in the technology industry) on an amicus brief  \nchallenging the order in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. When the administration rescinded the first order and replaced it on March 6, 2017, with a new executive order on immigration, we joined an amicus brief filed with the Ninth and Fourth Circuit \nCourts challenging the new order. \nPolitical contributions: Autodesk does not have  \na political action committee and thus does not \ncontribute to U.S. federal elections. The company did not contribute to state or local candidate committees in fiscal year 2017.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2017.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
