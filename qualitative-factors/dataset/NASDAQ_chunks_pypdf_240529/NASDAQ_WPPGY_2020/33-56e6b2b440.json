{"page_content": "REDUCING PRODUCTION \nEMISSIONS AT SCALE\nAdvertising production makes up \n14% of our scope 3 carbon emissions. \nWe cannot reduce these emissions \nat scale on our own. So in 2020, \nWPP became a founding partner \nof AdGreen, an initiative to unite the \nadvertising industry in eliminating \nthe negative environmental impacts \nof production.\nLaunched in the UK through the \nAdvertising Association, but with \nglobal ambition, AdGreen provides \nfree training, a renewable energy \nbuy-in scheme and practical \nresources to enable the industry, \nwherever the activity is, to act for \na sustainable future. In 2021 it will \nlaunch a carbon calculator to help \nproduction teams identify the \nactivities with the biggest impact. \nAt WPP, more than 40 people across \nseven agencies were AdGreen \ntrained in 2020. \nThe mission is simple: to make \nzero-carbon, zero-waste ad \nproduction the norm.\nIn 2020 we worked with Carbon Intelligence \nto map our carbon emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3) \nusing 2019 data. The chart (right) provides a \nbreakdown of our scope 3 carbon emissions.\nOur supply chain makes up the most significant \npart (98%) of our total emissions.\nWe will reach net zero emissions in our \nsupply chain by 2030. This target includes \nthe carbon emitted from the advertising we \nplace in the media on behalf of our clients \n\u2013 which represent over half (55%) of all the \nemissions in our supply chain. \nWe have identified four emissions \nhotspots to address:\n \u2013media spend;\n \u2013production; \n \u2013technology; and\n \u2013business travel (see page 34).\nIn 2021, we will work to develop detailed \nroadmaps and coordinate actions to reduce \nemissions across these hotspots. \nMEDIA SPEND\nWith over $60 billion in advertising placed in \n2020, WPP is the world\u2019s largest investor in \nmedia advertising. Our media investment \nforms 55% of our total scope 3 footprint. \nWe aim to work with our media partners to \ndevelop industry-wide standards for measuring \nand eliminating the carbon emitted from the \nplacement of advertising in the media.\nTo reduce emissions, over the coming years \nwe will focus on: \n \u2013improving data by developing a media \nchannel-level carbon calculator to \nunderstand emissions from each piece \nof content placed; \n \u2013asking vendors to share carbon data, \nfocusing on top 20 markets and vendors \nfirst so as not to disadvantage emerging \nmarkets or minority media; \n \u2013factoring carbon into investment \ndecisions; and\n \u2013creating education programmes and \nresources to ensure that we continue \nto create a healthier, diverse and more \ntrusted media ecosystem. PRODUCTION\nThe carbon emissions generated by the \nproduction of the films and other content we \ncreate on behalf of clients are responsible for \n14% of our total carbon footprint. \nThrough our production agency, Hogarth, \nwe are using virtual production technology \nand techniques to produce high quality work \nat scale, tailored to every channel and \naudience, while at the same time reducing \nthe associated carbon emissions \u2013 for \nexample by reducing the need for carbon \nintensive location-based shoots \u2013 and \nincreasing speed to market.\nWe recognise that we cannot reduce emissions \nfrom production alone. So in 2020 we \nbecame founding members of AdGreen, a \nnew industry initiative to eliminate the \nnegative environmental impacts of \nproduction (see case study, right).\nTECHNOLOGY\nThe technology we use \u2013 from data centres \nto the e-mails we send \u2013 generates carbon \nemissions that make up 6% of our scope 3 \nfootprint. As we increase our use of cloud \ninfrastructure, powered by renewable \nelectricity, we will reduce our energy \nconsumption and our carbon emissions, \nas well as drive down waste. \nFind out more about our net \nzero commitments and strategy \nat wpp.com/netzero  REDUCING VALUE CHAIN EMISSIONS \nVALUE CHAIN EMISSIONS\n\u25cf Media 55%\n\u25cf Production 14%\n\u25cf Other procurement 14%1\n\u25cf Minority investment 6%1\n\u25cf Technology 6%\n\u25cf Business travel  3%\n\u25cf Other business activities 2%1\n1 Other procurement spend includes spend related to facilities, \nHR, professional fees and similar items.
