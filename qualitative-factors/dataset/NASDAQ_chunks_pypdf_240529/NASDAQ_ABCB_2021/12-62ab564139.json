These relationships \nare invaluable and rewarding for all parties. \nTo promote more of these relationships \namong teammates, in 2021 Ameris continued \nthe Mentor Ameris program. The executive \nleadership team nominated high-potential \nmentees, pairing them with leader mentors \nto develop professional relationships that \nsupport ongoing career development. \nOutside of this program, Ameris encourages \nteammates across the organization to form \nmentor-mentee relationships, introducing \nspecialized guides to help teammates identify \nor become a mentor. In 2021, a diverse group of  \n30 high-performing teammates was  \nselected for the Mentor Ameris program,  \nand many more teammates developed valuable  \nmentor-mentee relationships. 30\nTEAMMATES\nAt Ameris, we know that \na growth mindset is key \nfor high performance and \nfosters an environment \nthat prioritizes continuous \nimprovement.\n\u201cI began the Mentor Ameris Program \nwith several goals in mind. It has been \nan incredible experience to have had a \nmentor who has opened doors for me to \nsee different departments and meet so \nmany amazing colleagues throughout \nour bank. I have seen firsthand the ideal \nqualities one should possess to be a \nleader and mentor to others. As someone \nwho has gotten the absolute most out of \nbeing a mentee in this program, I hope \nto pay it forward and become that same \nmentor to others in the future.\u201d  \n- Marshall Baker, \n   VP, Underwriter\n2021 CSR REPORT | 12", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ABCB_2021.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
