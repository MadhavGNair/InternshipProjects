We also support the health, wellness, \nand safety of our employees globally, and we work to ensure \nthat our suppliers do the same.Through our new seven-year \nenvironmental sustainability plan, we \naim to achieve carbon neutrality, while \nreducing water usage by 40% and waste \nby 75% by 2027.7 We will invest more \nthan $200 million over time to fulfill these \ncommitments, building on the success of our previous \nseven-year plan.\nQuality education for all is at the heart of \nthe Amgen Foundation\u2019s key activities. \nThrough programs and partnerships, the \nAmgen Foundation seeks to advance \nscience education, particularly among \nlow-income and disadvantaged students. \nSince the Foundation\u2019s inception in 1991, we have invested \nnearly $200 million in science education programming \nglobally, and, with our partners, reached millions of students \nwith high-quality science-based learning tools both in the \nclassroom and online.Much of what Amgen accomplishes is \nthrough partnerships. In particular, our \nwork to expand access to medicine \ninvolves a wide range of partners such \nas the CDC Foundation, Direct Relief, \nand the Union for International Cancer \nControl. We remain committed to joining with diverse \nstakeholders to tackle significant challenges from climate \nchange and health to gender equality and education.\nInnovation is core to Amgen\u2019s business. In \naddition to our pioneering medicines, Amgen \napplies innovation to our manufacturing, \npartnerships, and pricing. The demonstrated \nenvironmental benefits of our newest \nbiomanufacturing approach, which reduces the \nscale and costs of making biologics while vastly reducing water \nand energy use compared with conventional manufacturing, is also \nan example of the value of our innovative approaches.9\n7   Reductions take into account only verified reduction projections, and do not take into \naccount changes associated with the contraction or expansion of the Company.COVID- 19 \nRESPONSEETHICAL \nRESEARCHBUSINESS \nETHICSACCESS TO \nMEDICINERESPONSIBLE \nSOURCINGCOMMUNITY \nINVESTMENTGOVERNANCE APPENDIXENVIRONMENTAL\nSUSTAINABILITYDIVERSITY, INCLUSION, \nAND BELONGINGINTRODUCTION", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2020.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
