Mitigating a larger increase, waste \nreduction projects implemented in 2020 resulted in an \nadditional 181 MT of annual waste reduction. Since \n2007, we have reduced annual waste generation through \nprojects eliminating 2,849 MT, or 28%.^\nIn 2020, we continued to recycle plastics used in labs and \nmanufacturing facilities. Through these efforts, we diverted \nover 1,000 MT of plastics from landfill and repurposed \nthem for industrial uses, including benches at our sites. \nWe also continued to implement reusable shippers for \n90% of our clinical shipments, reducing solid waste by \n98%* compared to using disposable shippers. We have \nexpanded the program to include commercial shipments \nof our medicines.53\nRoutine Waste Generated and Waste Reduced Through Conservation (MT)* Value represents year-over-year \ncumulative and continuing avoidance.14,000\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,0009,0181,094\n20128,7801,094320\n201310,146\n2007Waste reduction* from  \n2013 through 2019Waste reduction* \n in 2020\nRoutine waste*Waste reduction*  \nfrom 2007 through 2012\nRecycle rate (%)*1,574181\n841,094\n9,841\n20201,0941,574\n9,818\n20191,0941,297\n9,642\n20181,0941,038\n9,856\n20171,094850\n10,330\n20161,094688\n10,054\n20151,094441\n8,929\n2014100% 80%6 0% 40%2 0%35535351 50 49 48 4852 52\n^ Reductions take into account only verified reduction projections, and do not take into \naccount changes associated with the contraction or expansion of the company.Routine Waste by Wa ste Hierarchy (MT)100%\n80%\n60%\n40%\n20%3,3344,762\n9231,094\n20123,2804,493\n1,0061,094320\n20135,7963,542\n807\n2007* Value represents year-over-year \ncumulative and continuing avoidanceRecycled, composted, \nand reused*Waste reduced from \n2007 through 2012*Waste reduced from \n2013 through 2019*Waste reduced in 2020*\nLandfill and incineration \nwithout energy recovery*Incineration with \nenergy recovery*\n3,1635,150\n1,5281,0941,574181\n20203,4904,746\n1,5821,0941,574\n20193,6184,625\n1,3981,0941,297\n20183,5654,790\n1,5011,0941,038\n20173,3695,517\n1,4451,094850\n20163,6725,235\n1,1471,094688\n20153,4384,501\n9921,094441\n2014ENVIRONMENTAL\nSUSTAINABILITYINTRODUCTIONRESPONSIBLE \nSOURCINGCOMMUNITY \nINVESTMENTAPPENDIX GOVERNANCECOVID- 19 \nRESPONSEBUSINESS \nETHICSETHICAL \nRESEARCHACCESS TO \nMEDICINEDIVERSITY, INCLUSION, \nAND BELONGING", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2020.pdf", "page": 52, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
