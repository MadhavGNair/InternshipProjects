Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets \nour fundamental expectations of our suppliers and is aligned \nwith our core values. \nOur Supplier Sustainability Program includes sustainability \nassessments of our suppliers\u2019 performance in relation to our \nSupplier Code of Conduct. Through these assessments, \nwe gain an understanding of the maturity of our suppliers\u2019 \nethical, environmental, and social governance programs. \nThese assessments have sometimes led to a dialogue and \nidentification of opportunities for the suppliers to develop \nplans to enhance their programs. In such cases, we \nmeasure their progress against these plans.56RESPONSIBLE \nSOURCINGINTRODUCTIONCOMMUNITY \nINVESTMENTAPPENDIX GOVERNANCECOVID- 19 \nRESPONSEBUSINESS \nETHICSETHICAL \nRESEARCHACCESS TO \nMEDICINEDIVERSITY, INCLUSION, \nAND BELONGINGENVIRONMENTAL\nSUSTAINABILITY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2020.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
