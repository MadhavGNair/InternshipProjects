They need to take action and use their voices.\nWhere do you feel the company has made the  \nmost progress?\nWe have a strong ESG track record and an ambitious \nagenda moving forward. In some ways, I think we\u2019ve \nhidden our light under a bushel for the past few years, while \nfocusing on developing strong systems that could yield \nrepeatable results. For example, we met and exceeded most \nof our 2020 environmental targets well ahead of schedule \n(see page 49). And, we helped low-income patients in the \nUnited States with no or inadequate insurance by providing \n$1.5 billion8 worth of therapies in 2020. The Amgen Safety \nNet Foundation has never refused a qualified patient. As we \nmove into 2021, we will continue these efforts and celebrate \nour progress, knowing that there is more to do.ESG GOVERNANCE\nThe Amgen Board of Directors provides oversight of \nAmgen\u2019s ESG activities, while the CRCC recieves updates \non specific ESG and corporate responsibility programs and \nactivities, as well as related compliance activities.
