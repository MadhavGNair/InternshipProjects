Our sites in Ireland, the Netherlands, \nand Singapore procure 100% renewable energy, and our \nSan Francisco facility procures 89% renewable energy.51\nIn 2020, we expanded our Smart and Integrated Facility Utility Monitoring Program, \nwhich assessed existing automation and monitoring systems and delivered a \nprioritized list of opportunities for improvements at targeted manufacturing and \nresearch facilities at six Amgen sites. Opportunities identified in 2020 resulted in \nconservation of 12,300 gigajoules (GJ) of energy and reduction of 1,300 MT of carbon. \nSince implementation in 2016, this program has resulted in savings of 243,000 GJ, \n15,700 MT carbon and approximately $4.2 million^ in operating costs.INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AT OUR FACILITIES \n^ Reductions take into account only verified reduction projections, and do not take into \naccount changes associated with the contraction or expansion of the company.ENVIRONMENTAL\nSUSTAINABILITYINTRODUCTIONRESPONSIBLE \nSOURCINGCOMMUNITY \nINVESTMENTAPPENDIX GOVERNANCECOVID- 19 \nRESPONSEBUSINESS \nETHICSETHICAL \nRESEARCHACCESS TO \nMEDICINEDIVERSITY, INCLUSION, \nAND BELONGING", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2020.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
