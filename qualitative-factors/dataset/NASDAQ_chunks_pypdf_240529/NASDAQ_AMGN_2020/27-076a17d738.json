{"page_content": "PERFORMANCE \nIn 2020, Amgen continued to support a culture of high \nethical values and transparency within its research \npractices. Key performance highlights are noted below. \nVoluntary Licensing\nIn 2020, Amgen entered into a voluntary licensing \nagreement with Medicines Development for Global Health \n(MDGH), a nonprofit biopharmaceutical company, for AMG \n634 for the treatment of tuberculosis and an inflammatory \ncutaneous and systemic complication of leprosy. Amgen \nout-licensed this compound after determining that Amgen \nwould not move forward with its development but that the \ncompound had potential benefits to global health that \nMDGH was well-positioned to advance. This compound is in \nPhase 2 development with studies led by the Aurum Institute \nNPC and The Leprosy Mission Nepal. Under the agreement, \nMDGH will assume full responsibility for further development \nand commercialization.\nINCREASING DIVERSITY IN CLINICAL \nTRIALS FOR CANCER TREATMENTS\nAccording to the FDA, for clinical trials in oncology, only \n5% of participants were Black \u2013 despite Black or African \nAmericans accounting for 13% of the overall population in \nthe United States.\n\u201cCancer doesn\u2019t discriminate,\u201d notes Dana Dornsife, \nfounder of the Lazarex Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit \norganization working to improve patient access to \ncancer clinical trials. \u201cIf the population of participants \nin clinical trials doesn\u2019t mirror our actual population, \nthen we\u2019re not developing drugs for everyone. We have \npatients who are dying because they don\u2019t have access \nto clinical trials, and we have clinical trials that are \ndying because they don\u2019t have access to patients.\u201d \nWe couldn\u2019t agree more. We are advancing an extensive \npipeline of potential new therapies for difficult-to-treat \ncancers, and we want as diverse a range of patients as \npossible to have the opportunity to join us in the fight. \nThat is why we\u2019re a founding sponsor of Lazarex\u2019s IMPACT  \n(Improving Patient Access to Cancer Clinical Trials) \nprogram, which aims to increase enrollment and retention of cancer patients \u2013 especially minority populations \n\u2013 in clinical trials by expanding awareness of trial \nopportunities, alleviating financial barriers, and helping \npatients navigate the sometimes-cumbersome clinical \ntrial process. With Amgen\u2019s support, of the participants \nin IMPACT over the past three years, 59% self-identified \nas minorities and 48% reported household earnings \nof $25,000 per year or less. Our most recent grant to \nLazarex at the end of 2020 supports the extension of \nIMPACT to new sites and the establishment of a cancer \nwellness HUB in Los Angeles.\nWe also know that four fifths of cancer patients in the \nUnited States are treated in community clinics. To \ngive these patients \u2013 many of whom are from lower-\nincome backgrounds \u2013 more opportunity to participate \nin our clinical trials, we recently established the Amgen \nCommunity Oncology Research Collaborators program. \nThis initiative will make it easier for community oncologists \nat more than 200 sites across the country to refer \ntheir patients for participation in studies of Amgen\u2019s \ninvestigational cancer medicines.
