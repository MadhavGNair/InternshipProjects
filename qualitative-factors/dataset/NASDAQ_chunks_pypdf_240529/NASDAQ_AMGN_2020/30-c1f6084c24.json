This includes the value to\n\u2022   Patients and society by enabling patients to live longer, \nbetter lives with their disease or condition than is currently \npossible (e.g., fewer symptoms and/or improved ability to \nperform daily activities).\n\u2022   Healthcare systems by decreasing the incidence of \nmedical procedures (e.g., the need for bypass surgery \nor stent placement following a heart attack or stroke) \nand reducing long-term care needs (e.g., potentially \npreventing hip fractures associated with osteoporosis).\n\u2022   Economies by enabling patients to be more active and \nproductive \u2013 at home and at work (e.g., by reducing the \nnumber of migraines).\nWe employ flexible pricing approaches to improve \npatient access that takes into account\n\u2022   The needs of patients and local health systems. We take \na tailored approach to pricing that balances a country\u2019s \nability to pay and the individual needs of patients.\n\u2022   General market dynamics. This includes the price \nof available comparator products or procedures in \ncomparison to the extent of the benefit Amgen\u2019s treatment \noffers above and beyond the current standard of care.1\n2Amgen understands that the cost of prescription medicines is a concern for many people. We are committed to the responsible \npricing of our medicines by considering their economic and social value and the clinical and economic burden of diseases.PROGRAMMATIC HIGHLIGHTS\nOur Approach to Responsible Pricing31ACCESS TO \nMEDICINEINTRODUCTIONRESPONSIBLE \nSOURCINGCOMMUNITY \nINVESTMENTAPPENDIXENVIRONMENTAL\nSUSTAINABILITYDIVERSITY, INCLUSION, \nAND BELONGINGGOVERNANCECOVID- 19 \nRESPONSEBUSINESS \nETHICSETHICAL \nRESEARCH", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2020.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
