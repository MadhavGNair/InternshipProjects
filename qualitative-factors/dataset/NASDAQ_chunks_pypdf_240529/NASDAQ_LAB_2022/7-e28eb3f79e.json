We intend to measure \nour progress and report to our stakeholders in a timely and transparent way through our annual \nESG Report. See the section below entitled Sustainability Initiatives for examples of actions we \nare already taking to reduce our energy use and waste.      \nAt Standard BioTools, we are committed to safeguarding, sustaining, and improving the environment for \nthe benefit of current and future generations.\nEnvironmental Risks\nWe are continually assessing our external risks, including environmental risks, to determine how best \nto proactively address any potential issues. While Standard BioTools has identified certain ongoing \nenvironmental risks associated with its business, we consider most of those risks to currently be \nimmaterial to our ongoing operations. Of these, we believe our most significant current risk related to \nthe environment is our increasing energy consumption. As our organization and business grows, so will \nour demand for energy. While it is difficult to quantify our environmental impact from increased energy \nconsumption at this time, we will continue to integrate our environmental and social responsibilities  \ninto our operations and strategic planning, making our operations more energy-efficient.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LAB_2022.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
