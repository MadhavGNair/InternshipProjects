{"page_content": "BUSINESS CONTINUITY \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nWindstream implemented several \nprovisions of our Business Continuity and \nPandemic Response Plans, which provide \na standardized strategy for managing \npotentially disruptive events. Key strategies \nfor continuity of our operations were \ntransitioning our employees to virtual \nhome offices in most locations utilizing \nthe company\u2019s robust collaboration \ntools, including OfficeSuite HD Meeting\u00ae, \nequipping our employees with personal \nprotective equipment (i.e., masks, hand \nsanitizer, gloves) and safety protocols based \non CDC guidance, and engaging critical \nsuppliers and vendors to ensure their \ncapacity to provide product and service \ncontinuity.\nWindstream\u2019s Corporate Business \nContinuity Management Program\u2019s mission \nis to identify risk to its essential business \nfunctions by developing plans to mitigate \nthose risks to protect our employees, \nbusiness operations, customers, and key \nstakeholders. As part of our program goals, \nwe promote business continuity awareness \nand participation at all levels within the \ncompany. We do this through annual \ntraining and exercises, and by observing \nBusiness Continuity Awareness Week each \nMay, which highlights the importance of \nbusiness continuity and focuses on building \nand investing in resiliency. \nAnnually, we conduct a Business Impact \nAnalysis to ensure that the essential \nbusiness functions are included in our plans \nfor recovery and restoration in the event of a disaster or business disruption. In \nconjunction with the impact analysis, a risk \nand threat analysis review is conducted for \nan understanding of any site vulnerabilities \nto determine remediation and consider \nmitigation as appropriate in the recovery \nstrategies. \nThe recovery strategies are intended to \nminimize the decision-making process \nduring a business continuity event or \ncatastrophic event. A catastrophic event that \ncould cause or has caused significant impact \nto our People, Premises, Resources, and \nSuppliers (P.P.R.S.). Catastrophic events are \nmany, ranging from natural disasters (e.g., \nfloods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes), \ntechnological disasters (e.g., cyber incidents/\ndata breaches), pandemics, to man-made \ndisasters (e.g., work-place violence, active-\nshooter). \nOur Business Continuity Management \nProgram in collaboration with key business \nprocess owners and leads has prepared and maintains plans for responding to \nthese events with documented Business \nContinuity Plans, Crisis Management and \nCommunication Plans, and Emergency \nAction Plans.\nOur teams are trained on the recovery \nand restoration procedures through \nparticipation in structured walkthroughs \nand tabletop exercises, and functional \nintegrated system tests. The recovery and \nrestoration procedures are developed to \nrespond to events impacting our P.P.R.S. \nSpecifically, the recovery strategies consider \na loss of facility, loss of systems, or loss of \nfacility and resources/suppliers. \nOur business continuity management \nprogram manager is certified by the \nBusiness Continuity Institute and in \nthe international business continuity \nstandard ISO 22301:2012. For ease of \naccess and management of the Business Continuity Management Program, we \nhave implemented a Business Continuity \nManagement (BCM) SaaS solution, which \nfacilitates the administration and utilization \nof our plans. The BCM system allows for the \nplans to be maintained in a real-time mode \ninstead of hardcopies for quicker and more \neffective response during an event with the \nlatest updates to plan components as well \nas the monitoring of a plan activation and \nrecovery activities following an event. \nBefore, during, and after an event, crisis \ncommunication is facilitated via our \nWIN Alerts notification system, which \nis imperative to ensure a coordinated, \nconsistent, monitored and controlled \nmessage throughout the event up until \nreturning to normal operations, which \nultimately addresses one of the primary \ngoals to provide situational awareness  \nand transparency and maintain  \ncustomer confidence.ENVIRONMENTAL\nAPPROACH ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDIX 14Windstream\u2019s Corporate Business Continuity Management \nProgram\u2019s mission is to identify risk to its essential business \nfunctions by developing plans to mitigate those risks to  \nprotect our employees, business operations, customers,  \nand key stakeholders.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WIN_2021.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
