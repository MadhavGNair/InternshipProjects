Through our work with The Global Travel & Tourism Partnership (GTTP), Marriott aims to inspire and enable hundreds of thousands of young people in secondary schools and universities around the world to build careers in travel and tourism. In 2020, Marriott\u2019s funding helped provide training for more than 1,800 \nteachers across 15 countries, benefiting more than 4,000 schools and over 740,000 \nstudents. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increased focus in online training and webinars, which allowed an additional 6,000 students from more than 100 countries to access the curriculum entirely online.\nAs part of a collaboration with the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance, Marriott and several \nother hotel companies joined together to create an industry-relevant skills curriculum, \nto better prepare young people for on-the-job training and improve opportunities for \njob placements. To support industry and company efforts in this space, we support the Alliance\u2019s Youth Employment Program (previously known as Youth Career Initiative), a three-month employability program, equipping vulnerable young people with the core skills and practical experience they need to start their career. \nIn 2020, even with major disruptions and closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more than \n180 young people were trained at 31 Marriott hotels across India, Vietnam, and Mexico.\nU.S. and Canada    \nAmerican Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) Foundation: Opening Doors  \nto Opportunity\nSince 2017, we have pledged to provide $50,000 each year over the next five \nyears to the AHLA Foundation\u2019s Opening Doors to Opportunity program to support \nacademic scholarships, professional development, and research opportunities in the travel and tourism industry.\nMarriott\u2019s support has enabled the Foundation to launch a COVID-19 Relief Fund, \nwhich provided more than $3.5 million worth of free education resources to help furloughed employees and establish the No Room for Trafficking Campaign to \nadvance training and education to prevent human trafficking in the lodging industry.
