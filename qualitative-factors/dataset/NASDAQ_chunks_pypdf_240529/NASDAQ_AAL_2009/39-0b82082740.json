{"page_content": "40 \n Workforce reductions \nAs with many industries, the financial challenges of recent years and the economic recession required us to reduce the size \nof our workforce to meet the needs of the business. Reductions have come from both management and non-management \nranks as well as from unionized and independent employee grou ps. The company makes every effort to maximize the \nnumber of voluntary reductions and minimize involuntary reducti ons. Whenever possible, we offer leaves of absence, stand-\nin-stead, voluntary bridges to retirem ent and other voluntary exit programs. \nFor union-represented employees (such as pilots, flight a ttendants, mechanics, and ramp em ployees), collective bargaining \nagreements specify procedures for reductions in force and related severance, as well as for recall back to the company, with \nappropriate re-training, when vacancies arise. Similar procedur es apply for reservations representatives and airport agents. \nFor management and administrative staff, American has well-deve loped, merit-based, and equitable practices for reductions \nin force. In most cases American provides access to j ob boards, listings, and other resources for finding new employment. \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2009.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
