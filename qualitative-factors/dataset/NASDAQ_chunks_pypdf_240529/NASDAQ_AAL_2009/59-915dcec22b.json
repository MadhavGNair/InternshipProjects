Ou r pilots must complete all required\u2014and \nrecommended\u2014FAA flight safety programs, as well as supplementary training courses developed by Eagle. \nTo ensure the safety of every flight, American Eagl e exceeds FAA requirements on a number of issues:  \n\u2022 The number of training hours pilots must complete at  American Eagle is greater than the FAA requires  \n\u2022 American Eagle's restrictions on the number of hours and flight segments per day that pilots can fly are stricter than \nFAA regulations mandate  \n\u2022 American Eagle has already implemented all the flight safety  programs the FAA is considering requiring for airlines  \nFor example, the Captain's Duties and Responsibilities  classes prepare new captains for their leadership role in operating \ntheir aircraft as safely and ef ficiently as possible. Our Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program  provides pilots with the \nadvanced skill set and expert knowledge to handle aircraft under seve re circumstances, for example, if flight controls \nmalfunction or during recove ry from unusual attitudes. \nAmerican Eagle also ensures that pilots are safe to fly ever y time they step into the cockpi t. We recognize that fatigue may \naffect crew performance. We therefore go beyond mere complianc e with federal regulations regar ding flight time limitations. \nWe limit our pilots to fewer hours of duty time and fe wer flight segments per day than FAA regulations require. \n  ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2009.pdf", "page": 59, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
