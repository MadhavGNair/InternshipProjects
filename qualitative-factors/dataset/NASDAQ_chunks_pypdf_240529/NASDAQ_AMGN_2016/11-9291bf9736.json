In 2016, we added waste generation from our \nnew manufacturing facility in Singapore. This addition was \npartially offset by two facility closures completed in late \n2015 and specific waste reduction and recycling projects. \nWaste reduction projects implemented in 2016 resulted \nin an additional 162 metric tons (MT) of annual waste \nreduction to achieve a total of 850 MT since establishing \nour 2020 Targets  in 2013. We have reduced waste \ngeneration through projects eliminating 1,944 MT, or \n19 percent, since 2007.Reducing Waste\nWe diligently seek to reduce waste and increase recycling \nto reduce our environmental footprint. Despite our efforts, \ntotal waste generation company-wide in 2016 increased \nfrom 2015. Some of the waste reduction practices and \nprojects we implement to drive waste reduction and \nrecycling deeper into our business include:\n\u2022  Recycling plastics used in manufacturing  \nwhere possible.\n\u2022  Composting of food waste, paper towels and \nlandscaping waste where available.\n\u2022 Efficient chemical management. \nRoutine Waste by Waste Hierarchy (MT)Recycled, Composted \nand Reused\nDisposedWaste Reduced* from \n2007 Through 2012Waste Reduced* \nfrom 2013+ENVIRONMENT\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0\n20124,2564,7621,094320\n20134,2874,4931,094688\n20154,8195,2351,094850\n20161,094\n5,517\n4,814\n20076,6043,542441\n20144,5011,094\n4,429\nREDUCTION  \nIN WASTE GENERATION\nSINCE 2007\nAdditional information can be found in the \nEnvironment  section of Responsibility on \nwww.amgen.com.19%ENVIRONMENT\n* Value represents year-over-year,  \ncumulative, and continuing avoidance.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2016.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
