Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments,  \nincluding the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. \n(g) The adjustments related to certain prior period items excluded from non-GAAP earnings, as well as resolving certain non-routine transfer-pricing and acquisition-related issues with tax authorities, as applicable.REPORTING", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2016.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
