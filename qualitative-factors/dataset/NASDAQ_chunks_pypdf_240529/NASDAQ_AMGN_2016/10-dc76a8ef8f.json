We complete \nenergy-related projects that provide substantial returns \nfor both energy savings and carbon reduction across our \nnetwork of facilities around the world. We have realized \nsavings of $24 million in operating costs annually and \nreduced carbon emissions by 104,200 metric tons (MT), \nor 25 percent, from 2007 through 2016 by implementing \nenergy conservation and carbon reduction projects.We are making progress toward our sales fleet carbon \nreduction target by raising the minimum fuel efficiency \nstandard for vehicles year by year.\nSome of the actions we\u2019ve taken to reduce energy and \ncarbon include:\n\u2022  Optimizing heating, ventilation and air conditioning \nin clean rooms at two U.S. manufacturing facilities to \nreduce energy consumption by 27,100 gigajoules (GJ) \nand carbon emissions by 3,200 MT.\n\u2022  Upgrading lighting systems to LED technology; reducing \nenergy consumption by 7,000 GJ and carbon emissions \nby 570 MT.\nCarbon Emissions and Carbon Emissions Reduced Through Conservation Efforts (1,000 MT)  2016 Energy Use by Source (1,000 GJ)Natural Gas\nFossil FuelScope 1 Sources\nScope 2 SourcesDiesel\nRenewablesPropane\nNuclear\nNonspecified* Value represents year-over-year,  \ncumulative, and continuing avoidance.Carbon Emissions\nCarbon Emissions Avoided* \nfrom 2007 Through 2012\nCarbon Emissions \nAvoided* 2013+ENVIRONMENT\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n014\n2015369848\n400\n1,314\n94431,207148 13\n201336384\n201238584 20\n201684\n291\n200741610\n201484\n35425%  \nREDUCTION\nIn Carbon Emissions  \nSince 2007\nAdditional information can be found in the \nEnvironment  section of Responsibility on \nwww.amgen.com.ENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2016.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
