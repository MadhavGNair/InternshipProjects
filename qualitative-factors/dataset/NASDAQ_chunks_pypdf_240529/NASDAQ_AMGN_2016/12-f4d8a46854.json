In 2016, we added water usage from our new \nmanufacturing facility in Singapore. This addition was \noffset by two facility closures completed in late 2015 \nand specific water conservation and recycling projects. \nWater conservation projects implemented in 2016 resulted \nin an additional 61,000 cubic meters (CM) of annual water \nreduction to achieve a total of 203,000 CM since establishing \nour 2020 Targets  in 2013. We measure progress toward \nour targets by quantifying results of projects independent \nof growth or contraction of the business. We do not count \nfacility or building closures in our target progress. We have \nreduced water usage through projects eliminating 889,000 \nCM, or 27 percent, since 2007.Conserving Water\nWater is a precious natural resource that is vital to Amgen\u2019s \nbusiness and to the communities in which we operate. \nSome of the projects and technologies we implement \nstrategically at various sites to drive water conservation \nresults include:\n\u2022  Water-efficient fixtures for restrooms, breakrooms and \nother facilities. \n\u2022 Drought-tolerant landscaping.\n\u2022  Smart irrigation technology and water-wise irrigation.\nWe\u2019ve reduced annual \nwater consumption by  \n27%   \nSINCE 2007.\nWater Intake and Intake Avoided Through Conservation Efforts (1,000 CM)  * Value represents year-over-year,  \ncumulative, and continuing avoidance.Water Intake\nWater Intake Avoided* \nfrom 2007 Through 2012\nWater Intake \nAvoided* 2013+3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n0142\n20152,52068619\n20132,725686\n20122,720686203\n2016686\n2,351\n20073,28636\n2014686\n2,487ENVIRONMENT\nAdditional information can be found in the \nEnvironment  section of Responsibility on \nwww.amgen.com.ENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2016.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
