We have proven that environmental \nsustainability is a wise investment, improving \nefficiency and creating value while supporting a \nhealthy environment.Our Targets\nWe established these 2020 targets from our 2012 \nbaseline performance. We created a portfolio of \nprojects and initiatives to achieve the targeted \nreduction by 2020. We track the results of those \nprojects and initiatives as progress toward the \nreduction targets, counting results where reduction \nis confirmed through a formal measurement and \nverification process.\nEnvironmental Sustainability in Action\nAmgen scientists have pioneered a new \nbiomanufacturing paradigm that is leaner, greener, \nmore flexible and productive and less costly to build \nand operate. At one-sixth the size of a conventional \nbiologics manufacturing facility, this smaller plant \nalso means a reduced impact on the environment. \nCompared to a large conventional facility, a next-\ngeneration biomanufacturing plant cuts carbon \nemissions and uses less energy and water.Progress Through 2016 2020 Target\nWaste  Reduce 1,490 metric tons (MT) of waste  \nto landfill or incineration \n35% of 2012 baseline\nWater Reduce 269,000 cubic meters (CM)\n10% of 2012 baselineCarbon  Reduce 3,000 metric tons (MT) of fleet carbon\n20% of 2012 baseline\nCarbon Reduce 38,500 metric tons (MT) of facility \ncarbon \n10% of 2012 baseline20,200 MT\n850 MT2,000 MT\n0%        20%              40%              60%               80%        100% 203,000 CM\n2012 Baseline 2020 TargetENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2016.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
