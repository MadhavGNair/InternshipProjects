ASP provides \nundergraduates with the opportunity to engage in \ncutting-edge research experiences at world-leading \ninstitutions and learn about biotechnology. In \n2016, we celebrated this milestone by unveiling the \nAmgen Scholars Ten to Watch,  which highlights \nthe best and brightest up-and-comers in science \nand medicine selected from more than 3,000 Amgen \nScholars alumni.The Amgen Foundation continued its partnership \nwith Khan Academy in 2016, providing a new three-\nyear, $3 million grant to develop comprehensive \nbiology content and becoming Khan Academy\u2019s \nScience Partner. Khan Academy is a leading, \ninnovative and effective educational technology \nplatform\u2014with 53 million registered users across \nthe globe\u2014with demonstrated power to shape \nand transform how we learn, including in science. \nPreviously, the Amgen Foundation provided Khan \nAcademy with a $700,000 grant and oversight to \ndevelop a series of videos, articles and quizzes for \nstudents taking biology courses at the Advanced \nPlacement through introductory college levels. \nThat partnership resulted in the creation of more \nthan 450 new biology content items.  \nThe Amgen Biotech Experience (ABE)  engaged\nnearly 80,000 high school students with a hands-on\nlab experience in 2016, reaching more than \n500,000 students to date. Over 800 teachers bring \nbiotechnology to their classrooms each year through \nthis hands-on molecular biology curriculum that \nintroduces students to the excitement of scientific \ndiscovery. The Foundation\u2019s support for ABE has \nsurpassed $14 million. \nMission Statement\nThe Amgen Foundation seeks to advance \nexcellence in science education to inspire \nthe next generation of innovators, and \ninvest in strengthening communities where \nAmgen staff members live and work.Invested worldwide to advance science \neducation and support our communities$19 M +COMMUNITYCOMMUNITY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2016.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
