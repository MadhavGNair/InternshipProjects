{"page_content": "34\nGentherm Sustainability Report | 2020ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS\nAs part of our sustainability efforts, Gentherm is establishing \nenvironmental targets against which we can measure our  performance related to resource intensity across key metrics.  These targets were developed using benchmarking and  comparisons to peer organizations, as well as consultation  with outside resources. As part of establishing targets, we have selected 2019 as our baseline, with all progress to be measured against our metrics as of that point in time.\n\u201cWe are so excited for the  \ndevelopment and launch of our \nfirst ever global environmental \nimprovement targets. While \nGentherm sites have long \ntracked their progress locally, these targets represent a big  \nstep forward as we take a broad \nview of our company\u2019s actions \naround environmental impact. \nAs we developed these targets, \nwe compared our present  \nstatus to external benchmarks \nas well as select peers. We found \nwe compared favorable to many \npeers, but we still see opportuni-\nty for improvement. I am excited \nby the hard work of our team \nand proud to demonstrate the commitment and progress. \u201d\nRAFAEL BARKAS\nSenior Vice President,  \nGlobal Operations and Supply Chain\nElectricity Usage T otal - MWH\nMetric:  \nElectricity Usage - MWH / $Mil.
