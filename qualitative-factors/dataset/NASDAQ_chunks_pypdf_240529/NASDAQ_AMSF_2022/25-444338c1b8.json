{"page_content": "Even with the most comprehensive safety \nservices, accidents happen. At AMERISAFE, we \nbelieve that all injured workers deserve to be \ntreated with respect. Our mission is to handle all \nclaims with concentrated, immediate, and highly \npersonable management and care. Regardless of \nthe nature of injury, AMERISAFE will be there for \nthe policyholder and injured worker.\nOur face-to-face approach requires that our \nField Case Managers (FCMs) live in proximity \nto our policyholders, allowing them to react \nquickly when the need arises. To further ensure \nthe best experience possible for the policyholder \nand injured worker, our FCMs are supported by \nNurse Case Managers and other knowledgeable \nresources so the FCM can be dedicated to the \nneeds of the injured worker.\nWith, on average, 49 claims per FCM, our FCMs \nare able to have more direct contact with injured \nworkers. In most cases, only one dedicated FCM \nwill be the point of contact, guiding injured workers \nthrough medical treatment, rehabilitation, return \nto work, and maximum recovery. We understand \nexpedient recovery and early return to work is the \noptimum outcome for all parties.CLAIMS\nAMERISAFE 2022 ESG REPORTSOCIAL\n26", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMSF_2022.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
