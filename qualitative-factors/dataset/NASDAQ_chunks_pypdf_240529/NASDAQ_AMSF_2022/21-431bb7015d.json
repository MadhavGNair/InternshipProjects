{"page_content": "AMERISAFE recognizes there is a significant transition to \na low carbon economy currently underway. This shift is \ncreating new and growing existing green jobs in various \nindustries domestically and internationally. For example, the \nwork required to install solar panels or wind turbines can be \nsimilar to installing a roof or working on cell phone towers \n\u2013 however, these types of jobs would be categorized under \ndifferent class codes. AMERISAFE is exploring how to track \nour coverage of these green jobs among our policyholders \nand measure growth over time.TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND GREEN JOBS\nIn August 2020, our headquarters in DeRidder, \nLouisiana, was significantly impacted by \nHurricane Laura (Category 4) with winds \nof 150 miles per hour at landfall. There was \nwidespread damage to homes, trees, and the \npower infrastructure of the area. AMERISAFE\u2019s \nbusiness continuity plans were in place, \nincluding internet and IT system redundancies \nand our ability to operate on generator \npower. The storm impacted nearly half of our \nemployee base. \nOur dedicated employees, both in DeRidder \nand throughout the country, were able to \ncontinue to serve our customers without \nsignificant disruption to business operations, \ndespite their personal circumstances. Aided \nby volunteers throughout the community and \nelectrical professionals from throughout the \ncountry, recovery efforts continued and most \npower was restored to the community within a \nmonth, although rebuilding and roofing repairs \ntook considerably longer.\nAMERISAFE\u2019s Safety Committee meets \ntwice a year to discuss events relevant to the \ncompany\u2019s safety plan, lessons learned from \npast experiences, and how our plan can be \nimproved in the future.CASE STUDY: HURRICANE LAURA\nAMERISAFE 2022 ESG REPORTENVIRONMENTAL\n22", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMSF_2022.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
