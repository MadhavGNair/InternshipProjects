As we continue to assess the risks \nthat climate change directly or indirectly presents to our business and operations, we may \ndo so in the future. \nWe have established other operational sustainability goals, such as reducing our paper \nusage. To achieve this, we have instituted a recycling initiative to track how much paper is \nbeing printed by each department (which is in turn converted into a trees and emissions \nconsumed metric to raise awareness), ensure that recycling bins for paper are clearly \nmarked and available in all breakrooms, and that our waste hauler comes to recycle all \nof our shredded paper. We are also investigating ways to make our business operations \nuse less paper but are somewhat limited by regulatory barriers such as state guidelines \nrequiring policyholders to affirmatively choose to not receive information in paper form.\n47\nABOUT ThIS REPORT\nAMERISAFE 2022 ESG REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMSF_2022.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
