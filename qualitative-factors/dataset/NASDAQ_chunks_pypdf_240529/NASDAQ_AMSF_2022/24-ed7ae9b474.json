{"page_content": "OUR POLICYHOLDERS\nA large part of being a responsible insurer is reflected in \nthe service we provide to our policyholders, as providing \ninsurance has dual functions as a means of protection and a \ntransfer of risk. Our approach to serving policyholders must \nbe grounded in a people-first mindset. \nOur customer base is largely comprised of relatively small \npolicyholders without the resources to have their own \nsafety departments. Our field safety professionals (FSPs) \nconduct interviews with potential companies before \nrelaying their feedback to our underwriters. FSPs will ask \nprospective policyholders about the safety training their \nemployees are given. That information helps the underwriter \ndetermine if they want to quote a given company. Often, \nwe provide safety services to our insureds as a function of our underwriting analysis to ensure we are insuring \npolicyholders that prioritize safety in their businesses. If this \nreduces claims it is a win-win for us and our policyholders. \nThis advice can overlap with environmental concerns as \nwell: for example, air quality and ventilation are key health \nand safety concerns for us when we conduct an inspection \nwith a prospective policyholder. \nAt AMERISAFE, we do not delegate underwriting to \nagencies, marketers, or any third-party providers. We hire \nunderwriters and train them to be highly disciplined when \nquoting and binding business, and our over 30-year history \ngives us an advantage when it comes to insuring high \nhazard industries.OUR PEOPLE-FIRST APPROACH \n25\nSOCIAL\nAMERISAFE 2022 ESG REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMSF_2022.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
