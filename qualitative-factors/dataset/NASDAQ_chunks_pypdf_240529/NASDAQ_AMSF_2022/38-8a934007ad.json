As \nsuch, AMERISAFE has limited direct communication with the prospective policyholder customers prior to issuing \na policy. The agencies and brokers we work with directly inform customers about the policy coverage available. \nTherefore, we work closely with those agencies and brokers to ensure they are able to transparently provide \nappropriate education and information on workers\u2019 compensation, our safety services approach, our premium \naudit process, and our claims process. These agencies and brokers spend extensive time communicating with \ncustomers and gathering information about customers\u2019 needs.\nOnce we receive a customer\u2019s information, and if the customer meets our underwriting criteria, our underwriters \nprovide a quote and payment plan options. If we need additional information after the policy decision has been \nmade, we communicate with the agents and brokers to obtain additional information from policyholders. All \npolicies are audited after they are issued. We directly contact any non-paying policyholders to avoid issuing \nnotices of cancellation. We also have training manuals for our employees and agents that discuss our processes \naround transparency and frequency of communication.\nAS OF 12/31/21Municipals\nCorporates\nEquities\nCash and cash  \nequivalents\nU.S. Treasuries  \n& Agencies\nMBS\nABS/CMBS64%19%6%6%3% 1%\n<1%\n39\nABOUT ThIS REPORT\nAMERISAFE 2022 ESG REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMSF_2022.pdf", "page": 38, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
