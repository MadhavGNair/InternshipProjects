{"page_content": "SAFE ABOVE ALL\nProtecting the people we serve is what \nmatters most. That\u2019s why we hire Field \nSafety Professionals (FSPs) with first-hand \nexperience in the industries we underwrite. \nWe provide safety services at employers\u2019 \nworkplaces as a vital component of our \nunderwriting process and to promote safer \nworkplaces. In most cases, our underwriters \nrequest a safety visit by one of our own \nFSPs before quoting a potential policy.\nWith FSPs on the ground living where \npolicyholders work, we can make sure \nworkers are Safe Above All by providing a \nclear observation of safety practices and \noffering verbal recommendations even \nbefore a business owner requests a policy \nfrom us.\nThrough our safety practices, we seek to \nhelp our policyholders prevent traumatic \nand debilitating injuries to workers. This has \nbeen a core principle of the company since \nits founding and one of the areas where we \nbelieve we have sustained positive impact \non workers and communities.\n27\nSOCIAL\nAMERISAFE 2022 ESG REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMSF_2022.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
