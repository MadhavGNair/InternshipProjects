{"page_content": "CLIMATE RISK AND RESILIENCY \nAs a monoline workers\u2019 compensation insurer, we do not \nhave the same exposure to weather-related events that most \nproperty and casualty insurers do. Currently, our Enterprise \nRisk Management program, led by our Chief Risk Officer, \nassesses climate-related risks in terms of the potential impact \non the industries of our policyholders and their employees. \nHowever, given our focus on high-risk industries, we \nrecognize the need to consider certain geographic metrics \nin assessing our exposure to climate related factors as they affect the risks we insure. In addition, we recognize we have \nsome operational risk in light of our Louisiana headquarters \nand have an internal Disaster Recovery Plan in place to \nmitigate this risk. This plan is designed with the goal to \nenable AMERISAFE to continue to work efficiently in the \nevent of a climate-related extreme weather event.\nOur process for identifying climate-related risks and \nopportunities mirrors our processes for identifying other \nrisks in our ERM program.\n21\nENVIRONMENTAL\nAMERISAFE 2022 ESG REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMSF_2022.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
