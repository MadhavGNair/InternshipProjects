{"page_content": "ESG Integration\nWe believe responsible investing creates opportunities to generate value and may contribute to long-term outperformance. \nAs a result, ESG factors are integrated into our bottom-up research process. By integrating ESG considerations with economic factors, the research teams seek to identify financially material ESG factors and arrive at an independent, holistic view of the investment. \nBenefits of ESG integration  \nIncorporating ESG factors can help develop a more holistic view of the investment opportunity. ESG integration can also \nstrengthen our conviction on the long-term viability of a company\u2019s profitability and business model. Clearing the short-term noise allows us to focus on long-term results. \nThree key benefits\nFinancial materiality is key  \nWe view ESG factors as a risk management tool and a potential alpha source. By integrating financially material ESG criteria \ninto the traditional financial analysis framework, we can form a comprehensive view of the investment and better evaluate future performance potential. The key is to identify financially material factors which could affect the company\u2019s long-term growth potential, profitability or creditworthiness. \nDebunking common ESG myths  \nThe ESG integration process is focused on managing financial risks and identifying opportunities by including more \ninformation in investment analysis to help inform our decision making. Contrary to some beliefs, ESG integration does not explicitly seek to make ethical, sustainability or responsible value judgements, and there is no hard restriction on the investment universe. Further, ESG integration does not necessitate major changes to the investment process and does not automatically translate into sacrificing portfolio returns.\n11Examples of potentially material ESG factors\nEnvironmental Social Governance\n\u2022Climate change & carbon emissions\n\u2022Energy efficiency\n\u2022Waste & pollution\n\u2022Water use & conser\nvation\n\u2022Deforestation\n\u2022Natural resource use\n\u2022Sustainability initiatives\u2022Human rights & labor standards\n\u2022Product safety and liability\n\u2022Workplace safety\n\u2022Workplace benefits\n\u2022Employee relations\n\u2022Diversity/inclusion policies\n\u2022Data protection and privacy\n\u2022Community involvement\u2022Board independence\n\u2022Board diversity\n\u2022Anti-corruption policies\n\u2022Shareholder rights\n\u2022Compensation structures\n\u2022Corporate political contributionsDeepens our knowledge Strengthens our conviction Promotes a long-term focus\nESG Integration", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2019.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
