{"page_content": "Proprietary sustainability research \nframework\nSustainable fixed income investing requires a tailored, research-intensive approach. To identify sustainable investment opportunities, we developed a proprietary process to assess the sustainability of fixed income investment opportunities. The process combines internal expertise alongside external data to analyze the investment\u2019s sustainability profile. \nTo help determine the investable universe, \na global Sustainable Investment Committee scrutinizes issuers' sustainability profiles, assigns issuers into sustainability pillars, identifies impact categories and matches each issuer\u2019s sustainability activities to the UN\u2019s SDGs. \nPursuing better outcomes and driving change\nTo effect positive change and influence outcomes, our Responsible Investment team engages with issuers individually and collaboratively to encourage sustainable practices and growth of sustainable businesses, which ultimately may help grow the eligible investment universe for this strategy.
