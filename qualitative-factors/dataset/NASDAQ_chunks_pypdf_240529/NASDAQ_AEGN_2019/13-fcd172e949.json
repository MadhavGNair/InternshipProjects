Although ESG factors are identified and assessed individually, the firm takes a holistic approach to integrating ESG factors along with credit analysis to understand the overall credit profile and how it could affect the investment. \nFrom corporate bonds and structured credit to sovereign debt, our ESG integration \nprocess seeks to evaluate the potential effects on economics and valuations.
