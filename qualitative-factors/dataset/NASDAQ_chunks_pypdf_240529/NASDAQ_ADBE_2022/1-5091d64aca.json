Purpose has been core to the company\u2019s DNA from its earliest days. Tere are three key areas in which we are uniquely positioned and motivated to make a diference: Adobe for All, Creativity for All and Technology to Transform. \nAdobe for All \nAdobe\u2019s purpose starts with our commitment to create a work -\nplace and community that refects the diversity of the world around us, where everyone feels included and respected and has the opportunity to make an impact. Greater representation leads to a virtuous cycle of more role models, advancement, growth and meaningful innovations for our customers and communities. We are proud of our progress in increasing women in Director+ roles globally by 50% and our Black community in the U.S. by 63% over the past two years. We are sponsoring the success of underrepresented minorities in technology careers at Adobe through initiatives such as the McKinsey Connected Leaders Academy in the U.S., Women in Tech Forum career coaching program in EMEA and Women Emerging Leaders Program in APAC . E\nxternally, we are investing in building a talent pipeline \nthrough strategic collaborations with historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions, such as Bowie State University, San Jos\u00e9 State University and Winston-Salem State University. Our innovative SheSparks internship program across our India sites enables women to successfully transition back to full-time work afer a career break, securing program management and technical roles at Adobe. \nCreativity for All \nAs the creativity company, we are uniquely commited to advanc -\ning Creativity for All: empowering millions of creators of all ages and backgrounds to access the tools, skills and platforms they need to express themselves, reach their full potential and share their diverse perspectives. From supporting emerging flmmakers through the Sundance Adobe Fellowship, to the hundreds of creators we\u2019ve aided fnancially through our Creative Residency Community Fund, to our Diverse Voices platform that elevates creators from a spectrum of disciplines, we are helping people around the world tell their stories on a larger scale.
