The Board, through its Corporate Governance, Nominating and \nSustainability Committee, also has direct oversight of the \nthe Impact Program and receives Impact progress reports at \nleast once each quarter.\nDirectors are obligated to act in good faith and owe \nthe bank a duty of care and duty of loyalty. They are \nexpected to exercise their business judgment in what they \nreasonably believe are the best interests of Amerant and \nits shareholders, as well as assess initiatives through the \nstrategic lens of our Impact commitments.\nThe Board oversees compliance with safe and sound \nbanking practices, ethical standards, and policies and \npractices. The Board ensures that a risk governance \nframework that complies with regulatory requirements \nis established and implemented. Each Board member is \nexpected to exercise sound independent judgment. The \nBoard is required to diligently oversee risk-taking activities. \nFurther, it holds the management team accountable for \nadhering to the established risk governance framework. \nDirectors rely on the honesty, integrity and business \nexperience of senior management, other company \nofficers, outside advisors, and auditors in discharging their \nobligations. Even so, in practicing its duty of care, the Board \nthoroughly evaluates the recommendations and decisions \nof these various entities. The Board establishes Amerant\u2019s \nstrategic direction and approves its annual financial and \nstrategic business plans. Senior management, in turn, \nis responsible for developing the strategic plans for the \ncompany\u2019s business and operations, and for presenting \nthem to the Board for review and approval. The Board \nreviews these plans periodically with senior management \nto monitor performance and progress and to determine if \nrevisions are warranted.
