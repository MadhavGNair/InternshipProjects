Most customers \u2013 like you \u2013 \ndon\u2019t see it or think about it, but this regulatory framework \nassures that certain standards are met and that good \nfaith is present in all of the bank\u2019s relationships, large \nand small. An important part of this framework is the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA), which encourages financial institutions to help meet their communities\u2019 \nneeds through safe and sound lending practices and by \nproviding retail banking and community development \nservices to all sectors. This means serving residents of \nlow- and moderate-income neighborhoods and making \ninvestments there.\nAmerant has a long-standing commitment to serving a \nvariety of individuals and neighborhoods. This includes \nfunding community development loans and contributing \nto programs in underserved regions. \nThese investments help revitalize designated \nneighborhoods throughout the communities we serve. \nWe also embrace opportunities to actively participate in \norganizations that support affordable housing, economic \ndevelopment, and community service.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), \nan independent branch of the U.S. Department of \nthe Treasury, rates banks for their CRA performance \nin three test areas: lending, investment, and service. \nBeing rated in these areas encourages banks to help \nmeet the needs of people in all the communities \nwhere they do business. Importantly, this includes \neconomically disadvantaged areas, low- and \nmoderate-income individuals, and small businesses. \nOnce again, Amerant received Outstanding and High \nratings in all three performance categories in its \nCRA evaluation by the OCC. The bank has earned \noutstanding performance results in its evaluations \nsince 2000.\nAmerant representative with home owners at Habitat Miami home dedication ceremony.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMTBB_2022.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
