Our Board of Directors \nmust reflect this diversity in gender, race, ethnicity, range \nof perspectives, and broad, substantial professional \nexperience. Individual directors apply their unique and \nvaried frames of reference to governance and operational \ndecision-making. Such diversity is vital to effective, forward-\nthinking oversight of the company. \nAs of December 31, 2022, the Board was composed of \neleven Directors. They have unique skills and backgrounds \nwhich, when combined, produce a complementary balance \nand richly diverse points of view.\nThe average tenure of Directors was 16.5 years. Nine directors \nare independent under the Nasdaq listing standards and \nincluded in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.  In continuing with the vision to evolve the diversity of the \nBoard, in December 2022, our Board appointed one new \nwoman member to the Board.  In April 2023, we announced \nthe appointment of our fourth woman director, Ashaki \nRucker, to our Board of Directors.\nIn 2022 a Third-Party Code of Conduct was developed in \nalignment with internal policy and procedures throughout \nthe Bank in preparation for use beginning in 2023.  The Code \nof Conduct provides relevant guidance, including ESG and \nDE&I initiatives, to Amerant\u2019s third parties in providing goods \nand services to the Bank.\nThe Code of Conduct was the first step of a three-year \nroadmap. Also in 2022, we began to capture data on our \nthird parties to identify and confirm ESG certifications or \nadherence to industry standards for the goods or services received, as well as data for DE&I. The KissFlow managed \ninformation system is used to complete due diligence and \ncollect data points of our suppliers.\nThis year, in 2023, we plan to begin reporting on data \ncollected and analyzing the supplier base to set up \nbaselines and create goals for the overall portfolio.\nIn 2024, year three of the roadmap, our goal is to create \nactionable steps that business units with supplier \nrelationships can take to work with more third parties \ncommitted to ESG and DE&I.\nWith this change, we now have three \nwomen directors and four self-identified \nminority directors. We intend to \ncontinuously improve Board diversity  \nand will continue to report annually on \nour progress.A Board that Reflects the \nCommunities We Serve\nResponsible Supply ChainWhite, Non Hispanic Hispanic Women Men 31-50 51+On 12/31/2022 \u2022 Non-Executive Board Members: 10\n70%30%\n60%40%10%\n90%Age GenderRace/  \nEthnicity", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMTBB_2022.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
