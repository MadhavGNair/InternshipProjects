It\u2019s about making sure \neveryone\u2019s voice is heard. And it\u2019s about making sure we \nreflect the communities we serve. To walk the talk, we took \nspecific actions to promote inclusive behaviors amongst all \nteam members. \nOur cross-functional diversity ambassador team leveraged its \ncompelling I Belong program to raise the profile of diversity \nand inclusion and encourage awareness organization-wide. \nThe I Belong Executive Council was formed, with 12 members \nrepresenting diverse locations, business units, ethnicities, ages and tenures. The team developed DEI short- and long-term \nstrategies built around its own Pillars: Talent, Workplace, \nCommunications, and Community.\n2022 was the first year Amerant committed to achieving \nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion goals. We were deliberate \nabout making an impact on our goals.  Amerant worked to \nincrease the percentage of women in Executive Positions \nthrough our hiring and promotion practices. We continue \nto develop women internally and have identified women as \nsuccessors for the Executive Leadership Bench.Our Team Members:  \nAn Important Community\nAmerant Bank\u2019s goal of building community starts at home. \nKnowing that our own team members make up a vitally \nimportant community in and of themselves, we have a \nframework of forward-thinking and competitive human resource \nprograms and practices. People who feel good about their \nprofessional development, ability to be heard, and the health and \nwellness of their families have more energy and \u201chead space\u201d to \ndevote to helping Amerant reach its goals. Implementing smart \nHR practices is good for us, and good for our team members.  \nWe strongly believe it strengthens our Impact efforts.\nPhilosophy:Our People at Amerant\nTeam member with family and friends at Amerant Bank 5K to benefit United Way Miami.\nTo recognize, appreciate and create opportunities for diversity and inclusion \nas we foster a sense of belonging that propels the growth of our team \nmembers and expands into the communities we serve.\nI Belong Pillars: Talent  /  Workplace  /  Communications  /  Community\nThree-Year Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Goals\nPromote Diversity and inclusivity\nto reflect the communities we serve.Promote an environment that leads to success \nand the overall wellness of our people.Increase Board Diversity*\n\u2022 Increase percentage of underrepresented \nteam members from 3.2% in 2021 to 7.75% \nby 2025.\n\u2022 Increase percentage of women in executive \npositions as classified by EEO-1 job \nclassifications from 40% in 2021 to 50% \nby 2025.\u2022 Increase engagement score to 80% by \n2025.\n\u2022 Educate all team members on the \nfoundations of DEI and unconscious biases.\n\u2022 Proactively address pay equity across all \nlevels of the organization.\u2022 Increase percentage of women \nrepresentation from 12% in 2021 to 50% \nby 2025.\n\u2022 Increase percentage of minority \nrepresentation from 50% in 2021 to 60% \nby 2025.
