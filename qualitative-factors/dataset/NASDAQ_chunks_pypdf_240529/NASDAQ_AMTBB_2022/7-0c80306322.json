Interns received educational \nopportunities, job shadowing, rotations, and mentoring \nfrom our senior leadership team. 70% of the 2022 \nintern class come from diverse backgrounds.  \n \nAs anyone familiar with mentorship knows, learning \nhappens on both sides of a mentoring relationship, so this \nprogram contributed to senior leaders\u2019 growth as well.\nRead three intern stories on page 16 to see this program \nat work. The 2022 intern class concluded in August with 5 of \nthe 10 interns receiving an offer for continued employment.

These in-\nperson and self-paced sessions are \npreparing team members for the FIS \ncore transformation. FIS Transition:\nOne Team, One Mission\nTo make it easier to bank with Amerant Bank, we \nare working with FIS on a major cloud conversion. \nThe goal is to consolidate functionality on the cloud \nand phase out legacy internal applications. FIS is an \nimportant provider of cloud-based fintech software \nfor businesses. More than half of the world\u2019s wealth \nis managed on FIS systems.\nThe project is designed to eliminate redundancy, \nreduce customized applications, and integrate \nplatforms and processes for deposits and loans; \ndigital banking channels; risk; fraud and compliance; \nfinancial controls; cash management; treasury \nmanagement services and more.\u00a0We are preparing \nfor the future of banking.\nThis is a transformation that goes beyond digital. It\u2019s \nan innovative step into the future of Amerant and \nthe Amerant customer journey. It\u2019s a shift in how \nwe approach our work and service our customers.\nInternally, a conversion like this is a major project. \nIt\u2019s been a team effort. Since late 2021, FIS has \nworked with more than 70 Amerant team members \nfrom Florida and Texas to review Amerant\u2019s \noperations, IT, and other critical processes.\nTo make this a reality, Amerant\u2019s change \nmanagement team developed a comprehensive \nlearning and communications plan to ensure \nteam members and customers are informed and \neducated every step of the way.\nSelf-paced learning was assigned to over 300 of \nour team members from October to December, \nwith 100% completion reported in January of \n2023. This milestone allowed us to enter the next \nimplementation phase - instructor-led learning and \nreadiness review. During this phase, Amerant team \nmembers will be testing all FIS Systems, based on \ntheir role, to make sure they are working properly.\nOur focus is One Team, One Mission.
