This \nroadmap was embraced across our oganizational hierarchy, \nfrom our Board of Directors and top management down to \nour front-line at our banking centers. \nWe worked collaboratively to set goals for our Impact \neffort and communicated them broadly to establish our \ncommitment.  We also defined specific metrics and targets \nin connection with our goals and put in place initiatives to \ndrive the success of these goals.Today, we\u2019re proud to say that team member contributions \nthroughout the organization consistently aim toward \nachieving our Impact goals. \nGoals are living things. As such, it was a year of learning  \nin 2022. Tracking Impact progress in real-time afforded \nthe opportunity to shift and adjust our metrics and targets \nbased on actual experience.
