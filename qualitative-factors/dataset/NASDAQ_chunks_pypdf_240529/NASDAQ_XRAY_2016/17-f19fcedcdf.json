Dentsply Sirona conducts all \nstudies with human subjects in a manner that \nprotects the safety and rights of patients and \ninvestigators. In addition to protecting the rights \nof individuals including confidentiality, Dentsply \nSirona complies with regulatory requirements \nof the countries in which studies are conducted \nand those in which regulatory submissions take \nplace. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s practice ensures that \ncontrols are in place and followed to protect the \nintegrity of the study results.\nC. Dental Amalgam\nDental amalgam, which is composed of a \nmixture of metals such as silver, mercury, \ncopper, and tin, is considered a safe, affordable, \nand durable material that has been used for over \n100 years to restore teeth affected by dental \ncaries (tooth decay). It has a long-established \nrecord of safety and effectiveness. While it has \nbeen the subject of questions because of its \nmercury content, dental amalgam has been \nstudied and reviewed extensively and continues \nto be preferred and used by dental professionals \nin certain clinical applications. Dentsply Sirona \nsells numerous restorative products that are \nalternatives to amalgam.\nMany organizations, including the American \nDental Association, Federation Dentaire \nInternationale (World Dental Federation) and the \nFDA, support the use of dental amalgam. The Company has reviewed and evaluated its dental \namalgam product line. This review included \nassessment of a wide range of factors, including \nthe clinical effectiveness of amalgam, published \nscientific studies regarding material safety, the \nresults of the FDA review of dental amalgam, as \nwell as environmental and legal considerations. \nBased on our internal assessment and published \nindustry research, Dentsply Sirona concludes \nthat dental amalgam continues to be a useful \nrestorative material whose safety and efficacy \nhas been extensively documented.\nBased on this assessment and the needs \nof customers, Dentsply Sirona expects to \ncontinue to responsibly manufacture and \nsell dental amalgam while focusing research \nand development investments on advanced \nalternative dental-restorative materials. In \nagreement with the Minamata Convention, \nDentsply Sirona supports the consensus for a \nphase-down approach, ratified by the Convention \nand signed by over 100 countries, to reduce \nthe use of dental amalgams. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s \nmarketing efforts and educational activities are \ndesigned to educate clinicians about the benefits \nand techniques for using today\u2019s state-of-the-\nart alternative restorative solutions. In addition, \nDentsply Sirona continues to promote the use \nof the American Dental Association\u2019s Best \nManagement Practices for Amalgam Waste to \ncustomers who choose to use dental amalgam. \nFinally, Dentsply Sirona supports a variety of \nindustry-wide initiatives to promote prevention \nof oral health disease, which in turn, reduces the \nneed for restorative procedures.SIMPLANT offers clinicians a comprehensive 3D system for accurate and predictable implant treatment including \ndental scanning and planning, drilling, implant placement and restoration.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XRAY_2016.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
