State-of-the-art \nexpertise in materials science, equipment \ndesign, and software development provide \nthe basis for Dentsply Sirona\u2019s Research and \nDevelopment team. This allows the team to \nutilize cutting-edge processing technologies \nto create exciting consumable products and \nequipment. Professionals use these products, \nwhich include some of the most established \nbrands in the global market to prevent and \ntreat dental disease as well as replace and \nregenerate oral tissue.

Pre-Clinical Testing\nDentsply Sirona develops and licenses \nnumerous medical devices for use in dental care \napplications. The vast majority of the products \nwe develop are substantially greater in quality \ncompared to products already available on the \nmarket. Whenever possible, Dentsply Sirona \nuses in vitro or benchtop methods that do not \nrequire testing in animals. When studies involving \nanimals are absolutely necessary (e.g. when \nrequired by law, regulation or standards) to \nestablish safety, Dentsply Sirona uses facilities \nthat follow the relevant national guidelines for the \nCare and Use of Animals. In the U.S., this follows \n21CFR Part 58 and 9CFR Parts 1-3 and global ISO \n10993-2 (Animal Welfare Requirements). These \nguidelines require that all studies be approved by \nan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee \nand the number of animals are limited to the \nminimum amount possible to demonstrate safety \nand efficacy prior to human clinical studies. \nWithin these facilities, animal research monitoring \nis required to ensure that the animals are treated \nsafely and humanely.5\nAquasil Ultra+ impression material delivers exceptional intraoral performance \nwith market leading intraoral hydrophilicity and tear strength which enables \nclinicians to capture and retain the detail they need.\nAdvanced new 3D imaging software improves the \nplanning and workflow of endodontic procedures \nempowering dental professionals to provide better, \nsafer, faster dental care.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_XRAY_2016.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
