As stated in our Code of Business \nConduct and Ethics, the Company\u2019s established \npolicy is that no company funds or other \ncompany assets may be contributed for political \npurposes, regardless of whether in the U.S. or \noutside the U.S., without the prior review by the \nCompany\u2019s General Counsel, and approval by \nthe Board of Directors.\nIn the U.S., Dentsply Sirona is a member of the \nDental Trade Alliance (DTA), an association \nof companies that provide dental equipment, \nsupplies, materials and services to dentists and \nother oral care professionals. The DTA\u2019s core \npurpose is to enhance member success and \nincrease dental demand. From time to time, DTA may engage in lobbying regarding legislation \nthat is of interest to its members.\nWith headquarters in York, Pennsylvania, \nDentsply Sirona is also a member of the \nPennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. \nThe Chamber is the commonwealth\u2019s largest \nbroad-based business advocacy organization \nwith a mission to improve Pennsylvania\u2019s \nbusiness climate and increase the competitive \nadvantage for its members.\nBased on inquiries with US-based trade \nassociations to which our membership fees \nexceed $20,000, the Company has determined \nthat the amount of such dues or payments \nthat may have been used for lobbying \npurposes is inconsequential, and no portion \nof such dues or payments have been used for \npolitical contributions.7\nDentsply Sirona has a long history of supporting the communities in which we live, work and serve. \nDentsply Sirona\u2019s Corporate Responsibility Platform represents our efforts to report on our sustainable \nactivities and sharpen our philanthropic focus in the area where we have the greatest impact - \nimproving the oral health of under-served populations.
