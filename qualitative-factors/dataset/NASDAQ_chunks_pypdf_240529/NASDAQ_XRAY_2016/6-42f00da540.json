This \nphilosophy we\u2019ve instilled is showing through \nthe pipeline of work and making a difference \nin the dentistry world. We\u2019re seeing engaged \ndental professionals who understand the \nneeds of their patients and are united around \nambitious ways to provide better care.\nBy working in tandem with student scientists, \nfaculty research, and clinical education, we are \ncreating a world in which people can receive the \ndental care they need by highly qualified dental \nprofessionals. And, we\u2019re providing education \nand support to smooth adoption and ensure the \nbenefits of innovations are realized.\nA few examples of these programs can be \nseen below:\nThe ADA/Dentsply Sirona Student Clinician \nResearch Program was initiated in 1959 to \ncommemorate the centennial of the ADA in \nNew York City as a joint venture between the \nAmerican Dental Association and Dentsply \nSirona (then DENTSPLY International). Since its \ninception over half a century ago, the program \nhas expanded to include 18 national programs \ncovering 39 countries and more than 7,000 \nstudents from around the world.Students and their faculty advisors have \ndeveloped new techniques and procedures \nthrough university-based oral health research \nby participating in the ADA/Dentsply Sirona \nStudent Clinician Research Program. The \ntalented students who earn the prestigious \nnational title are hosted by Dentsply Sirona to \nattend the American Dental Association annual \nsession where they have the unique opportunity \nto present their research with other national \nwinners at the global SCADA program.\nThe SCADA program (Student Clinician \nResearch program of the ADA) is comprised \nof a select and elite group of dentists who \nparticipated in the Student Clinician Research \nProgram at their individual schools and their \ncountry\u2019s national program. SCADA helps create \ndental leaders who benefit their communities \nby promoting health, relieving pain, and \nprotecting smiles. Many of the former student \nclinicians have gone on to become leaders in the \ndentistry profession. Some serve as academic \nleaders, others as leading scientists, many as \noutstanding clinicians and teachers.\nDentsply Sirona supports other educational \nprograms such as the ADEA (American Dental \nEducation Association), IFDEA (International \nFederation of Dental Education Association), \nAGD (Academy of General Dentistry), \nand several grants to various schools and \nuniversities around the globe.
