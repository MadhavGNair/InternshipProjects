Here\u2019s how the \neditors at Newsweek describe the process:\n\u201cWe're doing more than just counting how many benefits employers provide\u2014a solid 401(k) plan, medical benefits, \npaid time off and so on. Those things are, of course, important. But what we're measuring, critically, is how \nemployees feel about their organizations. There's a big difference, after all, between workers getting a kick out of free \nDoritos and whether they truly love and feel in sync with the company they work for.\u201d\nOver 21,000 people work at Microchip .
