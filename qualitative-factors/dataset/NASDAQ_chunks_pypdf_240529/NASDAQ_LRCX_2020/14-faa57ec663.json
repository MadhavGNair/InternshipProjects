{"page_content": "Policies and procedures  \nGlobal standards of business conduct   \nOur success has stemmed from a variety of \nfactors, but the top two are customer trust and \nour employees\u2019 dedication to a values-driven \nculture. To reinforce this culture and to help our \nemployees navigate a variety of circumstances, \nwe created our Global Standards of Business \nConduct (GSBC) policy. This is a written \nstandard of appropriate business conduct, \naddressing various issues including: \nprotecting confidential information, giving \nand receiving gifts or entertainment, avoiding \nbribery and corruption, engaging in accurate \naccounting practices, appropriately retaining \nrecords, properly using mobile devices and \nother company assets, avoiding conflicts \nof interest, promoting fair competition, \nworking outside of Lam, prohibiting insider \ntrading, and acceptable practices for public \ncommunications, donations, and political \nactivities. It also addresses workplace conduct \nissues such as harassment, discrimination, and \nimproper relationships.Effective compliance policies ensure \nsystematic, consistent methods and protocols \nacross our global business units and play a \nfundamental role in driving compliance and \nbest practices. To this end, we have additional \npolicies and procedures to provide further \nguidance on specific ethics and compliance \nareas, including: \n\u2022 Insider Trading\n\u2022 Conflicts of Interest\n\u2022 Conflicts of Interest Created  \nby Relationships\n\u2022 Anti-Harassment  \nAs the world around us evolves, so does our \nEthics and Compliance program. For example, \nwe published a Global Gifts, Meals, Travel \nand Entertainment Policy and Procedure in \n2020 and will release an Anti-Bribery and \nCorruption Policy in early 2021. This robust \npractice demonstrates our zero-tolerance \nstance towards bribery and corruption and \nour commitment to comply with global anti-\ncorruption laws and regulations.Ethics and Compliance risk management\nWe consistently assess internal and external risks \u2014 refining our programs and adjusting our \nannual plan as needed to further support responsible governance and ethics within our business. \nAnd because our global presence includes regions with differing governmental structures, wide-\nranging regulatory environments, and bribery and corruption challenges, enhancing our risk \nmanagement program is a high priority.  \nIn 2020, we strengthened our Global Supplier Code of Conduct to expand existing coverage \nof human rights, conflicts of interest,  labor  laws, health and safety,  environment,  and reporting \nconcerns.  In addition, we enhanced our Third-Party Compliance Questionnaire to further address \nand mitigate third-party risk to the company. We take a risk-based approach to third-party due \ndiligence and conduct due diligence exercises on higher risk suppliers and customers. We expect \nall of our third parties to operate in a legal, ethical, and compliant manner and to abide by all \napplicable laws, rules, and regulations including those related to anti-bribery and corruption. \nBusiness and Governance Products and Customers Responsible Supply Chain Our Workplace Sustainable Operations Our Communities Appendix\nLAM RESEARCH\n14", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LRCX_2020.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
