To improve both our recycling program and waste reduction efforts we conducted waste audits at our largest sites in 2013. We\u2019re using data from these audits to shape future initiatives for recycling and waste reduction.\nAmgen conserves water primarily with a wastewater treatment \nplant in Puerto Rico, which has enabled an average of 74 percent of the treated wastewater to be recycled on-site each year, and with low-water landscaping and smart-irrigation controls at a variety of facilities. In 2013, we developed water maps for each of our sites, following the flow of water through the site to its exit point. These studies help us understand our most significant water users and identify new opportunities for reclamation and reuse of water.\nWater Intake Water Intake Avoided \nFrom 2007 Through 2012*Water Intake Avoided* 2013 +3,000\n1,000\n5002,000\n1,5002,5003,500\n*Value represents year-over-year, cumulative, and continuing avoidance.2007\u20132013 Water Intake and Intake Avoided* \nThrough Conservation Efforts (1,000 m3)Water\n0Reduction\nRecycling, Composting, Reuse\nDisposal3,542\n6,604\n20074,037249\n4,798\n20084,757442\n4,370\n20105,197875\n4,449\n20114,532358\n4,177\n20094,7621,094\n4,256\n20124,5201,094320\n4,260\n2013\n20073,286\n20082,738550\n20092,537601\n20102,574663\n20112,577673\n20132,72568619\n20122,720686", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2013.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
