Our strategy has been to complete utilities projects that provide substantial returns for both energy savings and carbon reduction across our network of facilities around the world. In recent years, as we approach new construction projects, we have been building sustainable practices and technology into office and manufacturing facilities from the ground up. Energy conservation and carbon reduction projects have saved our company more than $20 million in cost savings and reduced carbon emissions by 92,000 metric tons since 2007.\nWe set a new carbon-reduction target related to our sales fleet for \n2020. We continue to expand the range of fuel-efficient vehicle choices available for mobile staff\u2014rotating vehicles that are less fuel efficient out of the fleet for more efficient options.\n2007\u2013201 3 US Fleet Fuel Use a nd Fuel Use Avoided Through \nConservation  (per 1,000 Gal)*\n2,000\n1,000\n500\n01,5002,500\nUS Fleet Fuel Use US Fuel Use Avoided \n2007 Through 2012US Fuel Use Avoided 2013 +Fuel Efficiency\n412\n200936Performance\n84\n385\n2012848\n363\n20134,341\n20074,019245\n2008542\n3,916\n2010718\n3,903\n2011407\n4,006\n2009919\n3,849\n2012919106\n3,817\n2013\n1,498\n20071,44314\n20081,849345\n20101,784363\n20111,297169\n20091,739427\n20121,738427104\n2013", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMGN_2013.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
