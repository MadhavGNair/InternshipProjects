Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets and non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including the various legal proceedings and stock option expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the tax jurisdictions where the expenses are incurred or the asset is located and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions.\n(d)The adjustments related to resolving certain non-routine transfer-pricing and acquisition-related issues with tax authorities as well as the impact related to certain prior period items excluded from adjusted earnings.Summary of Data\u2014Notes\nBusiness Profile\n(p)Corporate political contributions represent Amgen Inc.\u2019s US aggregate contributions among those states where these are permissible.
