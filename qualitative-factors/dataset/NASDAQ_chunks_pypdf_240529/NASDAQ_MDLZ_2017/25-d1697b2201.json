{"page_content": " 26\nSUSTAINABILITY\nMONDEL\u0112Z INTERNATIONAL PROGRESS REPORT | 2017\nUsing Less Packaging \nAs part of our broader commitment to sustainable \ngrowth and reducing our overall environmental \nimpact, we recognize and have developed \nprograms to address the biggest sustainability \nchallenges relevant to our business, including \nplastics pollution and climate change. We are \nreducing the environmental impact of packaging \nand tackling plastic waste in three key ways:\n\u2022 Reducing our packaging material by optimizing \nour packaging formats while also minimizing \nfood waste\n\u2022 Continuing to simplify our material choices \nand using innovative packaging materials to \nfacilitate recycling in existing infrastructure \n(most of our packaging is already recyclable or \nrecycle-ready)\n\u2022 Working in coalitions to support improved \ninfrastructure and greater harmonization \nof packaging formats so that more waste is \ncollected and can be recycled\nOver the years, our teams have worked to optimize \npackaging design and source materials that protect \nour products, helping to minimize food waste. Small \nadjustments can have a huge impact. Since 2013, \nwe have eliminated 53,500 metric tonnes and are \non track to meet our goal of eliminating 65,000 \nmetric tonnes. Our reduction efforts are substantial \nand consistent with guidance from bodies, such as \nthe European Union and the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, that have declared packaging \nmaterial reduction the highest priority.\nBy continually improving package design, we \nminimize our environmental impact. Using less \npackaging provides an economic as well as \nenvironmental benefit, not only in material  \ncosts but also in transportation and disposal. This helps us to reduce our overall CO2 emissions \nas well as operate more efficiently. By eliminating \npackaging, we saved an estimated 130,000 tonnes \nof annual CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2016.\nWe also reduce the amount of waste that \nconsumers and local authorities have to handle. \nThat\u2019s good for people, businesses and the \nplanet. Most of our packaging is already recycled, \nrecyclable or recycle-ready. In Europe, our largest \nmarket, 95 percent of our packaging is recyclable \nor recycle-ready, with 75 percent comprised of \neither glass, paper-based or metal material. And \naround 70 percent of our paper-based packaging \nis from recycled sources.\nThe remaining 25 percent of packaging is \npredominately thin flexible films, which are \noptimized to limit food waste and spoilage. Where \npossible, we use single material types rather than \nmulti-material laminates. These films are already \nin principle designed to facilitate recyclability, \nwhere facilities exist. More than 80 percent of \nthese films already meet these criteria and we\u2019re \nmoving the remainder of our flexible packaging to \nsingle materials, where possible. While most of our packaging is already recyclable \nor recycle-ready, we continue to simplify our \nmaterial choices and use innovative packaging \nmaterials to facilitate recycling in existing \ninfrastructure. Our approach is to ensure best \nbalance of product protection and minimal \npackaging material throughout.  \nTo help us achieve our goal, we have hundreds of \nprograms globally that contribute to packaging \noptimization and elimination. Highlights from 2017:\n\u2022 In chocolate packaging within our Asia, Middle \nEast and Africa regions, we redesigned many \nshippers and placed secondary packs directly on \nthe pallet, leading to a material saving of 1,297 \nmetric tonnes of corrugated paper\n\u2022 Across Europe, we redesigned injection-molded \ntubs for Cadbury Heroes  and used 17 percent \nless plastic material; the improved design also \nreduced the number of trucks used to transport \nthe empty tubs by more than 30 percent\nGoing Further Through Collaboration\nIn addition to our own programs, we are working \nin collaboration with partners to address elements \nbeyond our control, like waste recovery and tackling \nthe challenge of plastic waste. We are working in \ncoalitions to support improved infrastructure and \ngreater harmonization of packaging formats so \nthat more waste is collected and can be recycled.\nAs an active member of the Consumer Goods \nForum (CGF) Solid Waste Working Group, we \nwork with our industry peers to address common \nchallenges and support two initiatives CGF \nis currently engaged in: the Ellen MacArthur  \nFoundation\u2019s Global Plastics Protocol  and the \nOcean Conservancy\u2019s Trash Free Seas Alliance .GOAL  \n65,000  \nmetric tonnes\n53,500 \nmetric tonnes \nof packaging \neliminated", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2017.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
