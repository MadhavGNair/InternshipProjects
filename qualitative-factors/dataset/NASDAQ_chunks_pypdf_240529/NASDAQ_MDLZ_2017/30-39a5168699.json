It can provide fuel for energy \nor a boost to jump-start your day. It can also simply be a treat. \nYet, these days, there is so much focus on what people are \neating and not enough on WHY and HOW. Mindful snacking \nencourages people to eat with attention and intention, and \nto be truly present in the moment. Research has shown that \na mindful eating approach can help improve the way people \nsnack as well as help build a healthier relationship with food.  \nIn 2017, we partnered with Dr. Susan Albers, PsyD, Clinical \nPsychologist and Mindful Snacking Expert, to provide \ninformation including a consumer information guide  and tip \nsheet , as well as a resource guide  for healthcare professionals \nand educators on how to effectively help clients practice \nmindful snacking .  \nWe also organized a scientific symposium at the 2017 \nInternational Congress of Nutrition entitled Mindful Eating Applied to Snacking: A Promising  \nBehavioral Approach Supported by Research . Three international experts in the fields of nutrition \nand food behavior, psychology and food marketing\u2014Dr. France Bellisle, Paris 13 University, \nFrance; Dr. Jean Kristeller, Indiana State University, USA; and Dr. Yann Cornil, University of British \nColumbia, Canada\u2014shared in-depth knowledge and the latest scientific advances about mindful \neating. And we issued our sixth NutrInsight issue, detailing the latest research advances on the \nbenefits of mindful eating: Mindful Snacking: Scientific Evidence Supporting the Application of \nMindful Eating for Sensible Snacking Practices .\nThen, be in the moment. Here\u00b4s HOW:Snack Mindfully, Enjoy the Moment!\nSnacking is part of everyday living. It can provide fuel for energy or a boost to jump-start your day. It can \nalso simply be a treat.

Our nutrition labeling approach  is in line with international \nstandards, including Codex Alimentarius. We provide nutrition labeling on all of our products across \nour markets, displaying the amount per serving and/or per 100g (depending upon local regulations) \non eight key nutrients: energy (calories), protein, carbohydrates, sugars, fat, saturated fat, fiber \nand sodium. On very small packages with limited space, we list calories, protein, carbs and total fat. \nNutrition labels usually include the percentage that a nutrient provides of a person\u2019s recommended \ndaily intake, such as Daily Value or Dietary Reference Intake.  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2017.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
