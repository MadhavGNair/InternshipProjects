We have \nlaid out our expectations to all our direct suppliers \nin our published supplier contract provisions  and \nsupply chain transparency statements .\nAs a founding member \nof AIM-PROGRESS , \nwe also adhere to the \nSedex Member Ethical Trade Audit . This audit \nsupports the identification of potential human \nrights risks and helps guide our approach for \nimpact mitigation and monitoring. In 2017, 330 of \nour key suppliers\u2014 99 percent of our 2017 target \ngroup of highest priority suppliers\u2014completed the \naudit, in addition to the 286 suppliers audited in \n2015 and 218 audited in 2016.\nHUMAN RIGHTS\nWe are committed to doing business the right \nway and to our responsibility to respect human  \nrights . We subscribe in principle to the United \nNations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business \nand Human Rights, as a standard for preventing \nand addressing the risk of adverse impact on \nhuman rights by businesses. We undertake \npractical, business-minded, proactive, ongoing \nhuman rights due diligence to identify and \nmitigate potential and actual human rights \nimpacts within our own operations, and work \nwith our business partners through our supply \nchain to achieve the same. \nIn 2016, we partnered with the World Wildlife  \nFund  to assess the long-term sustainability risks \nof our agricultural commodities\u2019 supply chains. \nThis prioritized risk assessment examined \nagricultural commodities by source country \nbased on publicly available, secondary data, \ncovering our largest raw materials volume and \nspend. The assessment confirmed that our \ncocoa and palm oil supply chains should be our \ntop priority from an environmental and social \nrisk perspective.\nTo address human rights risk in the cocoa supply \nchain, including child labor, we leverage  Cocoa \nLife, a holistic sustainability program backed \nby a $400 million USD investment. Launched \nin 2012, Cocoa Life  aims to create thriving \ncocoa communities. We partner with farmers, \ncommunities, local governments, suppliers and \nNGOs, and invest directly in cocoa communities \nto promote women\u2019s empowerment, child \nprotection and education, and improve livelihoods. We commissioned human rights \nconsultancy Embode  to undertake child labor \nassessments within cocoa communities in \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire , Ghana  and Indonesia . Based on \nEmbode\u2019s recommendations, we are working \ntogether with government authorities, \nsuppliers and NGOs to harness the strengths of \nCocoa Life\u2019s  community model and bolster our \napproach to child protection [see Cocoa Life  \nsection of this report, page 11]. \nAs for palm oil, our updated Palm Oil Action \nPlan requires suppliers to respect the labor \nrights of all workers, including migrant workers \nwithin both their own operations and through \ntheir supply chains. We require suppliers \nto provide annual assurance of continuous \nimprovement in this area, verified by third-\nparty labor rights experts [see Palm Oil  section \nof this report, page 21].\nAdditionally, as a member of the Consumer  \nGoods Forum (CGF) , we renewed our \ncommitment to help eradicate forced labor, \nand joined forces with others to work \ncollaboratively to address those issues we \ncannot resolve alone [see Compliance & \nGovernance  section of this report, page 45].", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2017.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
