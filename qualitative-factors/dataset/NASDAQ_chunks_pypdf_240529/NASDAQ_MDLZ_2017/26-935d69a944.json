According \nto Quantis, a sustainability and lifecycle \nassessment firm, food waste has an adverse \nenvironmental impact 10 times greater than \npackaging. We are mindful of our responsibility \nto prevent food waste by protecting our \nproducts and pursue a multi-faceted approach \nto sustainability to avoid unintended \nconsequences on the climate that may arise \nfrom focusing solely on packaging.
