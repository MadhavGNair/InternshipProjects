These \nopportunities include mobilizing \nour consumer-facing brands \nand leveraging our partnerships \nwith agencies and advertising \nplatforms to drive change, \nequity and inclusion. \nOur DE&I approach focuses on setting the tone from the top, \nthrough our Board of Directors, and supported by the Mondel\u0113z \nLeadership Team and Global DE&I Steering Committee. We aspire \nto meet or exceed best in class representational percentages in \nall statistically underrepresented groups. And this is taken up by \ncolleagues across the globe, as we all work together to elevate \nthis important agenda through clear goals and accountability to \nmake change happen. \nTo further reinforce DE&I, we have included specific DE&I \naspirational metrics as part of our strategic scorecard within \nour annual incentive plan for the CEO and other senior leaders.\nThe scorecard is used consistently across the company at both \nthe corporate and region level and is linked directly to the three \npillars of our strategy \u2013 growth, execution and culture. \nIn September 2020, we announced our new three-year DE&I \ngoals. As an important step in our journey to make progress \nagainst DE&I, we established the Mondel\u0113z Diversity, Equity & \nInclusion Steering Committee including C-suite officers and other \nkey senior leaders charged with collectively setting the strategy \nand DE&I goals for the organization. \nDE&I Disclosures\n\u2022 EE0-1 2021 Consolidated Report\n\u2022 EE01 \u2013 2020 Consolidated ReportIncreasing Representation of Women in Leadership\nWe have improved women\u2019s representation at Mondel\u0113z \nInternational year-on-year for the past five years.
