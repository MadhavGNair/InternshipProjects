As part \nof our ambition to lead a sustainable snacking \ncompany, this partnership will help fund businesses \nthat are filling systemic gaps in the collection, \nsorting and reuse of plastic waste \u2013 particularly the \ncollection of flexible film used to safely package \nmany snacks like ours but which has historically \nbeen harder to collect, sort and reuse.\nGlenn Caton,  \nPresident Southeast Asia,   \nMondel\u0113z International\n Our support for a more sustainable future for \nplastics is clear. We\u2019ve made significant strides to \nreduce plastic packaging use, substitute plastics \nfor other materials, design for recyclability and \nset ambitious plastics packaging goals across our \nportfolio. We are proud of our progress to date \nbut know more must be done through innovative \npartnerships and investments like this one to \nbe able to scale more sustainable solutions \nfor plastics packaging, especially flexible film \nlike much of the plastic packaging used by the \nsnacking industry. This is why we\u2019re so keen to \nsupport the Ocean Fund.\nChristine Montenegro McGrath  \nSVP, Chief Impact & Sustainability Officer,  \nMondel\u0113z InternationalInvesting in the Circulate Capital Ocean Fund\nIn November 2021, we invested in the Circulate Capital Ocean \nFund (CCOF), a fund dedicated to addressing India and Southeast \nAsia\u2019s plastics challenges. A key issue here is the need to invest \nin creating collection infrastructures for plastics in parts of \nthe world where they are currently weak or inadequate. Our \ninvestment will help CCOF support scalable business solutions \nto help develop infrastructure for the collecting, sorting and \nrecycling of plastic waste, including flexible films. It will enhance \nthe focus on the physical collection of flexible films \u2013 lightweight, \nmulti-layer plastics used by the snacking industry \u2013 that have \ntraditionally been more difficult to collect, sort, recycle and \nultimately reuse. It is also expected to finance enterprises that \nsupport our goal to collect more plastic waste than we currently \nproduce across India and Southeast Asia.By investing in the Circulate Capital Ocean Fund, we aim to:\n\u2022 Support the fund\u2019s next phase of work focusing on collection \ninfrastructures for flexible plastics\n\u2022 Achieve our ambition to collect more plastic than we produce \nin India and South East Asia\n\u2022 Help develop infrastructure for sustainable, scalable systems \nfor collecting and sorting waste \n\u2022 Support technological advancements in recycling\n\u2022 Improve livelihoods by creating local jobs and supporting \neconomic growth\nPackaging\n(CONT.)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2021.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
