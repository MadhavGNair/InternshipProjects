At Mondel\u0113z International, we strive \nto provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate \nrelated issues following the TCFD approach.\nThe disclosure is structured around four thematic areas:\nOur climate strategy encompasses the decarbonization of \nour end-to-end supply chain in line with the SBTi guidance \nand following recognized carbon accounting standards (GHG \nProtocol). As such, we are focusing on the reduction of our \nScope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions.Our Board of Directors and the Governance, Membership and \nSustainability Committee of the Board provide oversight over \nour environmental and social agenda. Our CEO is engaged in the \nreview and progress of our ESG Strategy in conjunction with \nthe Governance, Membership and Sustainability Committee, \nwith regular briefings from our Chief  Impact & Sustainability \nOfficer. Our Chief  Impact & Sustainability Officer chairs our \nSustainability Steering Committee with key members from \nthe Mondel\u0113z Leadership Team (MLT). The Steering Committee \nreviews and approves environmental and social sustainability \n(including climate) related strategies.\nOur metrics are aligned with the SBTi requirements across \nour value chain including Scopes 1,2 and 3 while following the \nrelevant reduction pathway.\nManaging Risks\nWe have an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process for \nidentifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing risks, with \noversight by the Risk and Compliance Committee (MRCC), \nwhich reports annually to the Audit Committee. The purpose \nof the MRCC is to manage our process to identify and assess \nour most significant risks so we may adequately mitigate them \nand/or monitor them across the Company.  The MRCC assigns \nownership of specific risks to the Mondelez Leadership Team. As \nowners of each specific risk, MLT members are responsible for \nverifying that appropriate mitigation controls and monitoring \nsystems are in place. The risk universe considered during this \nprocess is wide and varied. Climate change is included in this risk \nuniverse and so we consider broader climate change impacts. \nIn 2021, we began collaborating with EY to conduct a climate \nrisk and opportunity assessment using climate scenario analysis \nin alignment with the TCFD. The assessment does consider \nphysical risk through chronic and acute climate change related \nimpacts as well as transition risks (policy, market, technology, \nreputational) across our end-to-end supply chain. The objective \nis to enhance our identification, measurement and monitoring \nprocess while leveraging the well-established ERM capabilities \nwe have in place.Governance\nStrategy\nRisk  \nManagement\nMetrics \nand TargetsClimate Action \n(CONT.)\nOffering Our First Ever Green Bond\nIn September 2021, we announced the successful pricing of \nour first green bond \u2013 totalling \u20ac2 billion, it was the largest \ngreen bond issuance to date in the packaged foods and \nconsumer goods industry.
