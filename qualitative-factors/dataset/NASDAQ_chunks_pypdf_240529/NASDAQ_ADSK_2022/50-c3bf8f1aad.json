Autodesk has partnered with Bravely, a confidential coaching service  \nthat supports individuals and workplace health, to foster discussions about aspects of identity that impact our employees in the workplace.  \nBravely spaces introduce and reinforce critical concepts of allyship and  \nworking together more inclusively and equitably through storytelling,  \neducational content, and active group sharing. The events ignite  \nself-discovery and connection that can be further explored through individualized coaching and conversations between colleagues. \nSpeaker series \nOur Diversity & Belonging Speaker Series brings outside experts to engage the entire Autodesk community in conversations about identity and diversity. Dialogue Spaces facilitated by Autodesk employees followed some events to offer colleagues across the  \ncompany the opportunity to discuss the expert\u2019s books and podcasts  \nin small groups.

Expand leadership diversity\nWe are expanding leadership diversity from the Board of Directors to senior leadership and to all areas of Autodesk. As a global company, it is critical that our leadership reflects the perspectives of our customers around the world. Therefore, we have prioritized growing our leadership capabilities globally, resulting in a 2.6% increase in the number of leaders outside of the United States.\n \nWomen make up 50% of our 10-member Board of Directors, which  \nis composed of 10% Black membership and 90% white membership.\nOur commitment to attracting and recruiting diverse talent extends  \nto our senior leadership team. In February 2021, we announced \nthe appointment of a new chief financial officer, chief technology officer, and senior vice president, all of whom expand the diversity of our senior leadership. Forty-five percent of our executive team is women. \nWe are committed to the growth and development of all our \nemployees. Some programs target specific demographics as part of our diversity and belonging strategic goals. For example, Autodesk was a proud participant in the McKinsey Black Leadership Academy in 2021, which creates opportunities for rising Black leaders to network and build relationships with leaders from other organizations. \nIn early 2022, we launched NEXT LEVEL, a program designed  \nto create a pipeline of underrepresented people of color who are \nready to move into leadership roles. To better understand and mitigate individual reasons for attrition, during 2022 we also started conducting Career Advancement Retention Effort  (CARE) interviews. \nWe offer several professional and leadership development \nopportunities for all employees, including our Emerging Leaders Program and Employee Leadership Program/Autodesk Leadership Program. \nAll employees can also participate in the Autodesk Mentorship \nProgram, as a mentor, mentee, or both. The program breaks down the barriers of meeting and learning from colleagues around  \nthe world and offers resources and guidance to nearly 3,000 active members (as of January 2022).  \n \nLearn more about learning and organization development at Autodesk.   \nSee detailed performance metrics in the Data summary .*   Data are as of the end of fiscal year 2022.Leadership data, FY22*\n67.0%\n33.0%  Male\n  FemaleOverall leadership, by gender ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2022.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
