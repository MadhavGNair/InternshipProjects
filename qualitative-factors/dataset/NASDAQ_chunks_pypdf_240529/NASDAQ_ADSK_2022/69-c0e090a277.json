Delivering on that commitment requires that our relationships with each other be founded on trust and respect, which we must earn every day by always adhering to  \nthe highest standards of ethical business conduct.\nOur Code of Business Conduct (COBC), last updated in February \n2022, articulates standards of conduct meant to ensure we  \ndo what\u2019s right for all our stakeholders and is aligned with our Culture Code.  \nDuring the first quarter of each fiscal year, all Autodesk officers and active employees, including those of our global subsidiaries, are required to review and reaffirm their commitment to the  \nCOBC and complete COBC training. For fiscal year 2022, 100% of active employees completed this requirement.\n1\nOur COBC includes instructions for reporting potential violations of the law or Autodesk policy. Autodesk\u2019s Business Ethics and Compliance Hotline enables employees and third parties to report suspected violations for investigation and resolution. \nWe are committed to complying with all applicable anticorruption \nlaws and regulations.

We also require our partners  to support fair labor practices. If business partners don't abide by the Partner Code, they are subject to a range of actions, up to termination of their relationship with Autodesk. \nThe Partner Code also promotes supplier diversity, and \nencourages our US-based suppliers and vendors to certify as diverse suppliers (if applicable), develop their own supplier diversity programs, and support diverse businesses.

This covers information about fair labor, human rights, GHG emissions, and science-based targets for all RFPs globally, and questions about supplier diversity for RFPs in the United States. In addition, we have added questions about sustainable business practices to RFPs worldwide related to IT infrastructure, IT hardware, facilities, marketing, events, and travel.
