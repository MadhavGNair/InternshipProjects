It is also home to many informal urban neighborhoods, where houses are often built by those who lack the proper skills or training to ensure structural safety.\nBuild Change is working to protect these vulnerable houses.  \nThe nonprofit organization\u2014which works in emerging nations to  \nreduce deaths, injuries, and economic losses caused by earthquake-related structural collapses\u2014is using innovative technology to identify retrofitting opportunities in this city of 7 million. In collaboration with the Autodesk Foundation, Build Change has developed a cloud-based field-capture tool that can evaluate homes and zero in on structural weaknesses. With this tool, the organization can scale its work rapidly, with the goal of more than 11,000 interventions in 2022. \nLearn more\nImage courtesy of Nexleaf Analytics\nImage courtesy of Kheyti\nImage courtesy of Build Change\nImage courtesy of Sanergy\nImage courtesy of  \nThe Mortenson Center Image courtesy of Build Change", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2022.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
