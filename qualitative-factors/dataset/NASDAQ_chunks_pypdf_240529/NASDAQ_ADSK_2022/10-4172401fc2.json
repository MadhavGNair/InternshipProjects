This reduces our own impact \nwhile enabling us to thoughtfully engage with our customers and partners on their own sustainability journeys. For the second year  \nin a row, we neutralized our GHG emissions across our operations  \nand entire value chain, through the deployment of the Autodesk  \nCarbon Fund. \nAutodesk first committed to achieving net-zero carbon across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 on an  \nannual basis beginning in fiscal year 2021. Since setting this target, definitions of net- \nzero have converged; most notably illustrated by the release of the Science Based Targets initiative\u2019s (SBTi) Corporate Net-Zero Standard in October 2021. We welcome this increased  \nrigor and standardization. \nOur net-zero carbon target is a journey guided by: \n \u25cfCl\nimate targets grounded in the latest science and aligned to a 1.5\u02daC climate trajectory \n \u25cfP\nrioritization of internal investments and activities that decarbonize our operations  \nand those of our suppliers\n \u25cfA c\nommitment to neutralize and compensate for all remaining Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions  \non an annual basis through the purchase of high-impact carbon avoidance and removal \noffsets, as well as renewable energy certificates. \nThe SBTi validated our GHG emissions reduction targets in fiscal year 2022 and determined  \nthat our fiscal year 2031 Scope 1 and 2 target is aligned with the 1.5\u02daC trajectory.

We anticipate an \nincrease in business travel-related and overall Scope 3 GHG emissions in the coming years.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2022.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
