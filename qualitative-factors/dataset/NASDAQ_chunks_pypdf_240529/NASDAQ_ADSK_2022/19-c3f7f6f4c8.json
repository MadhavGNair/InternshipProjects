Evolve has used Fusion 360  \nsince 2016, but\u2014like many companies\u2014the team assumed generative design was complicated, expensive, and best suited  \nfor additive manufacturing.\nBut recently they applied generative design to an electric \nhypercar component and quickly realized the time and cost savings of designing with artificial intelligence and the ease  \nof manufacturing parts on a CNC machine. With an electric vehicle, weight reduction is critical to hit performance and range targets. For the component, Evolve also focused on strength, performance, and stiffness. Most critically, it had to be optimized for CNC milling.\nWith these parameters in Fusion 360, the team could quickly  \nsee different possibilities and choose their priorities for the \ncomponent. They ultimately selected their preferred solution  \nfrom a full set of design options.The final electric hypercar component was 40% lighter than the initial design and the project was completed in record time. That\u2019s just the beginning  \nas Evolve moves generative design into more projects.\nLearn more\nImage courtesy of EvolveImage courtesy of Yuma Labs \nImage courtesy of Hyimpulse\nImage courtesy of PIX Moving\nImage courtesy of GANAS MFG", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2022.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
