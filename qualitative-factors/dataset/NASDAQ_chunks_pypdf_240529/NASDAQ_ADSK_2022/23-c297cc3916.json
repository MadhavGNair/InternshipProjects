The company\u2019s recycled carbon fiber solutions\u2014which have been found to exhibit the same mechanical properties as virgin carbon fiber\u2014can be incorporated into intermediate materials (products that require additional processing),  \nincluding non-woven fabrics, thermoplastic pellets, and 3D printing filaments. \nRecycling carbon fiber is 95% less energy-intensive and 50% \nless expensive than making virgin carbon fiber. Vartega aims to enable growth of the circular economy by closing production loops across all material composites. Greenhouse gas reduction remains central to the company\u2019s metrics. For every metric ton of carbon fiber recycled, Vartega saves 13.4 metric tons of CO\u2082 compared to manufacturing virgin carbon fiber.  \nVartega\u2019s patented recycling hardware was designed and \nengineered with AutoCAD, Inventor, and Fusion 360 technology and provides strong, flexible, low-cost composite materials to  \nkey industries, including aerospace and automobile.\nLearn more\nSangam Ventures\nis drawing new investors to  \ncommunity-centered solutions in India. \nLearn more\nImage courtesy of Vartega\nImage courtesy of Closed \nLoop Partners/AMP Robotics\nImage courtesy of \nSangam Ventures", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2022.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
