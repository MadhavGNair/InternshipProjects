At that location, project coordinators and detailers fine-tune models and install instructions to exacting detail. Fabricators assemble the units to UL Certification standards under direct supervision of licensed electricians, and more crews package and ready the units for shipment, often weeks in advance of install. This approach can save time, reduce risk, and improve efficiency. As the construction industry faces unprecedented\n \nlabor \nshortages, digital transformation enables Interstate to do more with less.  \nInterstate\u2019s lead VDC/BIM specialist says, \u201cI basically taught myself Revit  \nwhen there were three of us at the company doing BIM. And ever since, \nwe\u2019ve been learning, growing the team, and transforming how we work.\u201d Today, two dozen of Interstate\u2019s workers are experts in 3D model coordination and detailing. And an even larger share turns those drawings into fully built electrical systems\u2014without ever stepping foot on the jobsite. \nCOVID-19 further accelerated the transformation. Interstate started moving \nall its projects to Autodesk Construction Cloud, and crews communicate through Microsoft Teams. Office teams worked from home at the height of the pandemic and are moving to hybrid schedules now. Field teams coordinate with the office almost entirely by computer. According to Interstate,  \n\u201cPeople were wary of change, but we didn\u2019t have a choice. Some could barely turn on a laptop before, and now they\u2019re doing digital markups.\u201d \nDigital transformation also changed how Interstate interacts with job \ncandidates\u2013and who those candidates are. Interstate built an inclusive and comprehensive recruiting process and has broadened its scope to non-traditional audiences such as veterans, people with disabilities, women, and minorities. \nLearn more Interstate Electrical Services Corporation \nInterstate Electrical Services energizes the future  \nwith digital transformation and an inclusive workforce\nImage courtesy of IESC", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2022.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
