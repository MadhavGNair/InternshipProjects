{"page_content": "Engaging With Our Fuel Suppliers on Upstream Emissions\nWe know that tackling climate change requires companies like ours to address not only \nthe GHG emissions that stem from our own operations (Scopes 1 and 2), but also those \nassociated with our supply chain and other Scope 3 emissions.\nAbout 76% of American\u2019s Scope 3 \nemissions are from jet fuel, including \nthe fuel used by our contracted regional \ncarriers and the upstream emissions \nfrom our fuel suppliers. These upstream \n\u201cwell-to-pump\u201d emissions \u2014 including \nextraction, crude transport, refining and \nproduct transport \u2014 constitute approxi-\nmately 20% of petroleum jet fuel life cycle \nemissions.* To move the needle on our \nScope 3 emissions, we know we must work \nwith our fuel suppliers to better under -\nstand the steps they are taking to reduce \nemissions within their operations.\nIn 2021, we initiated a process to engage with our key fuel suppliers, with the initial  \nobjectives of improving data quality and our reporting on their upstream emissions, as  \nwell as understanding their resiliency to the physical risks from climate change. \nAlso in 2021, we improved our CDP Supplier Engagement score to an \u201cA\u2013\u201d . In 2022,  \nwe became the first major U.S. airline to join the CDP Supply Chain program to help  \nus develop a more detailed understanding of our Scope 3 emissions.
