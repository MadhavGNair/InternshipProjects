{"page_content": "Collaborating on Climate-Related Technology and Policy Solutions\nAmerican is actively working to reduce our carbon \nfootprint, but we recognize that we cannot achieve our \nambitious goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \non our own. Given the nature of the climate challenge \nand of our industry, transitioning to low- and no-carbon \naviation depends on innovations in airframe, engine and \nfuel technologies, combined with effective policies that \ndrive those innovations and the necessary investments \nto bring them to scale. American is committed to \ncollaborating across the public and private sectors \nto help advance the policy and technology solutions \nneeded to get to net zero.\nOne way we are doing that is as an anchor partner of \nBreakthrough Energy Catalyst (Catalyst), a ground-\nbreaking program within the larger Breakthrough Energy \nnetwork that is working to accelerate the development \nand commercialization of critical technologies for \ndecarbonization. Catalyst\u2019s initial focus is on SAF, green \nhydrogen, long-duration energy storage and direct air \ncapture. It is bringing together partners from across the \npublic and private sectors, using a creative, blended \nfinancing approach that combines philanthropic, below-\nmarket and low-cost capital to make targeted investments \nto scale and reduce the \u201cgreen premium\u201d of new decar -\nbonization technologies. American has committed to \ninvest $100 million in the effort. Catalyst also brings \ntogether experts to develop policy recommendations for accelerating innovation and encouraging the widespread \nadoption of clean technologies. \nClimate technologies moving out of the lab and into the \nmarket often struggle to access capital due to higher risk, \nlower demand and lesser returns than exist for more mature \nsolutions. Catalyst helps finance first-of-their-kind projects that deploy these innovative climate technologies, with the \naim of reducing risks, driving down costs and creating a \nsmoother pathway to widespread market adoption./gid00010/gid00041/gid00049/gid00032/gid00046/gid00047/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041/gid00047\n/gid00021/gid00032/gid00030/gid00035/gid00041/gid00042/gid00039/gid00042/gid00034/gid00052/gid00001/gid00014/gid00028/gid00047/gid00048/gid00045/gid00036/gid00047/gid00052\n/gid00003/gid00028/gid00046/gid00036/gid00030/gid00001\n/gid00019/gid00032/gid00046/gid00032/gid00028/gid00045/gid00030/gid00035/gid00006/gid00028/gid00045/gid00039/gid00052\n/gid00020/gid00047/gid00028/gid00045/gid00047/gid00048/gid00043/gid00021/gid00032/gid00030/gid00035/gid00041/gid00042/gid00039/gid00042/gid00034/gid00052/gid00001/gid00005/gid00032/gid00049/gid00032/gid00039/gid00042/gid00043/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041/gid00047/gid00001/gid00028/gid00041/gid00031\n/gid00004/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00028/gid00041/gid00052/gid00001/gid00003/gid00048/gid00036/gid00039/gid00031/gid00036/gid00041/gid00034/gid00013/gid00028/gid00045/gid00034/gid00032/gid00183/gid00020/gid00030/gid00028/gid00039/gid00032/gid00001\n/gid00004/gid00042/gid00040/gid00040/gid00032/gid00045/gid00030/gid00036/gid00028/gid00039/gid00036/gid00053/gid00028/gid00047/gid00036/gid00042/gid00041Point of vulnerability\nTech DevelopmentPoint of vulnerability\nCompany BuildingPoint of vulnerability\nEarly Deployment \nFunding Gap\nAMERICAN AIRLINES ESG REPORT 2021\n13\n\\\\ Indexes & Data \\\\ Customers \\\\ Team Members \\\\ Safety \\\\ ESG Strategy CEO Message\nADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE \\\\ Climate Change", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2021.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
