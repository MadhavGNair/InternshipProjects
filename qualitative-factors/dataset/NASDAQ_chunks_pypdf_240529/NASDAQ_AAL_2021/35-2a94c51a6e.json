{"page_content": "Connecting Pilots to Peers for Valuable Support\nAmerican has long offered an Employee \nAssistance Plan that provides emotional \nand mental support for our team \nmembers around the world. We know \nthat pilots, in particular, face unique \npressures every time they enter the \nflight deck.\nFor more than a decade, Project \nWingman has been providing our \npilots and their family members \nwith additional, specialized support \nwhenever they need it. Established by \nAmerican and the APA, this peer-to-\npeer 24/7 helpline allows pilots to \nreach out to other pilots for emotional \nand occupational support. Because it \nprotects the privacy of its users, Project \nWingman also alleviates any concerns \npilots may have regarding the stigma  \nof seeking help.\nMore than 40 pilots currently volunteer \nfor Project Wingman. In addition to \nbringing a unique understanding of \nthe challenges pilots can face in their professional and personal lives, these \nvolunteers all undergo specialized, \nintensive training. As a result, they know \nwhen to lend a sympathetic ear and \nprovide encouragement or recommend \nother resources when the situation \nwarrants greater intervention. \nProject Wingman is managed by a \ndeputy chair of the APA aeromedical \ncommittee, and American employs \na pilot at the managerial level on a \nfull-time basis to support and promote \nit. That includes visiting our pilot \ntraining programs to talk about it \nand meeting with the chief pilots on \na regular basis. Given the program\u2019s \nsuccess, he also advises other airlines \non their pilot mental health initiatives. \nThe U.K. and European Union require \nsuch peer-to-peer programs, and the \nFAA recommends them for all airlines. \nFor detailed safety performance data, see page 58 .\nAMERICAN AIRLINES ESG REPORT 202135\n\\\\ Indexes & Data \\\\ Customers \\\\ Team Members \\\\ Climate Change \\\\ ESG Strategy CEO Message\nOPERATING SAFELY \\\\ Safety", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2021.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
