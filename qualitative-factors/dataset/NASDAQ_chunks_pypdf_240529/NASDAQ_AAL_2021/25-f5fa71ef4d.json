Given the vulnerability of these key airports to flooding from \nsea-level rise, and the resulting impact to business continuity, \nwe intend to investigate options to mitigate the impacts of \nsea-level rise, which may include fortifying the shoreline around \nthose facilities and, as a last resort, considering options for \nrelocation to areas further inland. The cost/benefit of available \noptions may lead to adjustments to our network. We also plan \nto engage with policymakers and airport authorities to explore \npaths to greater resiliency. \nOver the next five years, we plan to incorporate the projected \nimpacts of climate change into aircraft purchasing plans, routing \nand scheduling. We will also work with airframe and engine \nmanufacturers to develop aircraft that meet the technical \nspecifications required for operation at airports with sustained \nhigh temperatures.Potential Financial Impact Level\nlow\n med\n high\nAMERICAN AIRLINES ESG REPORT 2021\n25\n\\\\ Indexes & Data \\\\ Customers \\\\ Team Members \\\\ Safety \\\\ ESG Strategy CEO Message\nADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE \\\\ Climate Change", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2021.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
