{"page_content": "We are also exploring ways of ramping up those figures \nsubstantially. With a large number of pilots retiring over \nthe next several years due to the FAA-mandated retire -\nment age, we find ourselves with a once-in-a-generation \nopportunity to change the face of the flight deck. Diversi -\nfying our pilot pipeline not only helps ensure that we have \nthe talent we need to support our customers, but it uplifts \ndiverse communities by providing individuals with access \nto well-paying careers with clear paths for advancement. \nAmong our initiatives, we expect our recently revitalized \nCadet Academy to play an important role. (See Developing \nthe Next Generation of Pilots on page 42.) Building on a long-standing commitment to pay equity\nAmerican has long championed pay equity, and we were \nproud to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge in 2016. \nSince then, we have continued to refine our efforts to \nidentify and close pay gaps based on gender, race and \nethnicity. The 86% of our workforce that is covered by \ncollective bargaining agreements has built-in pay equity as \npart of those agreements. Therefore, we have focused on \npay equity for the remaining 14%, made up of management \nand support staff, who do not belong to unions.\nAfter engaging a labor and economics firm to support our \npay equity analysis, American began deploying Syndio\u2019s \nworkplace equity platform in 2020. Through Syndio\u2019s \nguidance, we fine-tuned our methodology and successfully \ncompleted pay equity reviews through 2021. Our approach \nbegins by placing team members in one of 50 \u201csimilarly \nsituated groups\u201d (SSGs) across American based on the type \nof work they do. We then identify factors that can impact \ncompensation within each SSG, such as an individual\u2019s \nseniority, experience or pay scale. Of course, higher salaries \nawarded to any new or existing team members can result \nin unintended pay gaps. By running a pay analysis at key \npoints throughout the year, we can identify any drift in pay \nequity and address it. (See box at right.) \nIn 2021, American also became the first airline \u2014 and one of \nonly a handful of large U.S. companies \u2014 to receive Fair Pay \nWorkplace\u2019s inaugural pay equity certification. This Seattle-\nbased nonprofit is working to dismantle pay disparities based \non gender, race and ethnicity to create sustained fair pay. Our \ncertification means that American has committed to apply valid methods for identifying pay equity issues \nand for implementing an ongoing remedia -\ntion plan over time. As such, our rules and \nstandards are available to the public.\nThe Fair Pay Workplace certification \napplies specifically to our management and \nsupport staff teams. Among our certification \nrequirements, American will undergo regular \ncheck-ins that involve a seven-point review of our remedi -\nation plan. We have also pledged not to ask job candidates \nabout their prior compensation or expectations for starting \npay, which Fair Pay has identified as one of the largest \nsources of pay gaps. \nIDENTIFYING PAY GAPS\nThe chart below shows American\u2019s controlled pay gap for gender \nand race/ethnicity as of May 2022. By running a pay analysis on \na regular basis, we can quickly close any gaps.\nPeople of color earned $1 for \nevery $1 earned by white team \nmembers in similar jobs\nPOC$1 $1\nWhiteWomen earned 99\ufffd for \nevery $1 earned by men \nin similar jobs\nFemale99\ufffd$1\nMale\nPILOT DIVERSITY\nWe hired 2,155 pilots in 2021 and started to  \nmeaningfully impact representation.\n  Current Pilot Population\n  2 0 2 1  New Pilot Hires\n/gid00003/gid00039/gid00028/gid00030/gid00038 /gid00024/gid00042/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041 /gid00017/gid00032/gid00042/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032/gid00001/gid00042/gid00033/gid00001/gid00004/gid00042/gid00039/gid00042/gid00045/gid00132/gid00134/gid00332/gid00133/gid00136/gid00332\n/gid00139/gid00332\n/gid00136/gid00332/gid00134/gid00332/gid00136/gid00332\nAMERICAN AIRLINES ESG REPORT 2021\n40\n\\\\ Indexes & Data \\\\ Customers \\\\ Climate Change \\\\ Safety \\\\ ESG Strategy CEO Message\nSUPPORTING OUR TEAM MEMBERS \\\\ Team Members", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2021.pdf", "page": 40, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
