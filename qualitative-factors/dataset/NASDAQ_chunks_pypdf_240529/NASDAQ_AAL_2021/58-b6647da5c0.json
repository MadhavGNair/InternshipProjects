Of the six mainline accidents in 2021, five involved turbulence that caused crewmember injuries. The sixth involved damage that occurred \nwhen the aircraft struck a light pole with a wingtip during taxiing; there were no injuries to customers or crewmembers as a result of this event. Of the two regional accidents, one involved a passenger injury that occurred during a turbulence event, when a passenger \nfailed to follow crewmember instructions to remain seated. The other was a crewmember injury during pushback from a gate.\n*** Defined to include enforcement actions by the FAA, the European Aviation Safety Agency or equivalent national authorities related to the regulation of aviation safety.\n\u2020  The majority of our risk assessments are performed proactively prior to implementing or revising systems/procedures. American\u2019s comprehensive SMS covers safety risks and hazardous situations related to six areas: flight safety, flight service, ground operations, \ntechnical operations (maintenance), security and environmental. The figures reported here include all such risks identified by our SMS. The number of risk assessments increased in 2020 due to operational and staffing changes as a result of COVID-19; e.g., returning to \nservice aircraft that had been stored required risk assessments to determine readiness to fly.\n\u2021  Our SMS requires that we mitigate identified risks, particularly high risks, to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). These systemic and residual risks are monitored, measured and tracked.\n\u00a7  Due to the slowdown in travel across the industry in 2020, American implemented an expansive temporary aircraft storage program throughout the network that resulted in a significant increase of aircraft on the ground, where damages are most likely to occur.\nTeam Member Safety Performance 2021 2020 2019\n Mainline Regional Mainline Regional Mainline Regional\nInjury rate*6.29 5.13 5.64 3.82 9.57 7.11\nLost day rate**5.60 2.99 3.66 2.33 6.14 3.74\nWork-related fatalities 0 0 0 1 0 1\n* Total recordable cases per 200,000 hours worked.\n** The lost day rate, which the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration calls the Days Away from Work Injury and Illness rate, is calculated as the number of cases multiplied by 200,000 work hours divided by total hours worked.\nAMERICAN AIRLINES ESG REPORT 2021\n58\n\\\\ Customers \\\\ Team Members \\\\ Climate Change \\\\ Safety \\\\ ESG Strategy CEO Message\nINDEXES & DATA \\\\ Indexes & Data ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2021.pdf", "page": 58, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
