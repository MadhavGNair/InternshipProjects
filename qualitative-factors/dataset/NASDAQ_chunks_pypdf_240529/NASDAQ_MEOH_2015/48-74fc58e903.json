The main objective was to promote higher collaboration among Japanese companies, and to share best practices. In the seminar, Methanex took a leading role in explaining what TRANSCAER is, and shared the advantages and values generated from TRANSCAER programs.   \nAt the end of the seminar, we conducted a survey to understand our Japan business partners\u2019 \nviews about TRANSCAER. Based on their positive feedback, we plan to organize a mini TRANSCAER education event in 2016, which will focus on flammable goods truck safety.\nProduct Stewardship\u2003\u200347", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2015.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
