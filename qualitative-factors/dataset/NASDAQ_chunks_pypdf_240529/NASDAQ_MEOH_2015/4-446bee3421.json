{"page_content": "Methanol is water soluble and safely transported by rail cars, trucks,\nocean tankers and pipelines to customers around the world.\n.\nWHAT IS METHANOL?  \nMethanol (CH\u2083OH) is made of hydrogen, \noxygen and carbon. It can be produced from \na variety of sources, including natural gas \nand coal, as well as renewable sources such as municipal waste, landfill gas, biomass and captured carbon dioxide (C0\u2082). Methanol is \nmost commonly produced on an industrial \nscale by combining natural gas with steam \nor oxygen to produce synthesis gas, which is then converted to raw methanol and distilled to create pure methanol. The result is a clear, \nliquid, organic chemical that is water soluble \nand readily biodegradable.  \nApproximately 60% of all methanol is used \nto produce traditional chemical derivatives (e.g., formaldehyde, acetic acid) to make hundreds of industrial and consumer items that we use in our lives every day. These include building materials, foams, resins, paints, plastics and various health and pharmaceutical products. Approximately 40% of methanol is used in energy-related applications (see following page). \n\u2022 29% Formaldehyde\n\u2022 10% Acetic Acid\u2022 11% Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE)\u2022 5% Dimethyl Ether (DME)\u2022 12% Fuel Blending\u2022 11% Methanol to Olefins (MTO)\u2022 3% Biodiesel\n\u2022 19% Other\u2022 21% Asia Pacific \n   (ex.
