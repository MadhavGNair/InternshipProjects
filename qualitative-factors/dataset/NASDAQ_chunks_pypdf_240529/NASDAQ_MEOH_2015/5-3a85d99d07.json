{"page_content": "Uses of\nMethanol\nother40% energy\nFormaldehyde\nThe principal methanol derivative, this \nchemical building block is used to produce \nsynthetic resins used in adhesives for \nplywood and carpeting. Also used in \ntextiles, dyes, drugs, paper and leather.\nAcetic Acid\nUsed as a solvent and in the manufacture of\nrubber, plastics, acetate \ufb01bers and pharmaceuticals.\nMuch of world\u2019s acetic acid is used to produce vinyl \nacetate monomer (VAM) for use in paints and adhesives.Methyl Methacrylate (MMA)\nUsed in methacrylate resins and plastics (e.g., \nplexiglass, PVC). Also used in LCD TV and computer \nscreens, molding/extrusion powder and coating.\nOther Traditional Applications\nOther chemical uses and derivatives include: \nmethylamines, silicones, windshield washer \ufb02uid, etc.Methanol to Ole\ufb01ns\nMethanol has emerged as an alternative \nfeedstock in the production of ole\ufb01ns\nused in plastics production.Methanol is an important chemical building \nblock used to make countless industrial and consumer products. \nThe fastest growing market for methanol is \nin the energy sector.Fuel Blending\nDirect blending of methanol with gasoline is an \nalternative and reduces tailpipe emissions.\nDME or Dimethyl Ether\nDME is a methanol-based synthetic fuel \nsimilar to liquid petroleum gas (LPG), and\ncan be directly blended with LPG or used\nas a diesel substitute.Biodiesel\nBiodiesel is a renewable \nfuel alternative to diesel.\nFuel Additive\nMTBE is a fuel component that, \nwhen added to gasoline, helps \nreduce emissions.\nOther Energy Applications\nMarine fuels, methanol \npower, methanol fuel cells.\nMethanol in our LivesEnergy-related applications include direct \ngasoline blending, dimethyl ether (DME) and biodiesel.\nMethanol blending into gasoline offers \nan alternative to the import of petroleum products, and additional clean-burning fuel choices to consumers. Methanol blending enables the extension of the fuels pool through the use of feedstocks such as coal, gas and biomass to produce methanol, which can be used as a substitute for imported gasoline.\nMTO (Methanol to Olefins) has emerged \nin China as an alternative to naptha-based production technology in the production of olefins such as ethylene, propylene and other plastic products.  \n4\u2003\u20032015 Responsible Care and Sustainability Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2015.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
