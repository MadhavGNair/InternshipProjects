These local champions help facilitate and teach key Responsible Care concepts to their colleagues.\nIn May 2015, we launched the first Switch On \nsessions for all employees in Trinidad, and continued the roll-out in New Zealand, Egypt and Vancouver. To date, approximately 520 employees have attended the Switch On to RC programs globally. Six internal facilitators have \nbeen fully accredited to deliver the program:  \ntwo from New Zealand, one from Trinidad,  \none from Geismar and two  from Egypt.  \nIn 2016, we will begin the process of accreditation for three additional internal facilitators, two from Chile and one from Medicine Hat.\nCareer Development Program\nPiloted in 2015, the Career Development Program provides development opportunities to Methanex manufacturing employees through short-term assignments with corporate functions (corporate employees also have short-term assignments in manufacturing).
