{"page_content": "CUSTOMER \nSATISFACTION\nAlongside our Customer Panel, feedback from our \nmonthly CSAT survey  is our biggest measure of how \nsatisfied customers are with their travel experience \n(details of which are published on our website). Every \ncustomer who flies with us each month is invited to \nrate their trip based on the below measures.\nWe have a very strong satisfaction rate of 89%*, up \n2% from last year\u2019s score. In FY22 we recorded a \nsignificantly improved CSAT Score. This was largely \nas a result of less flights and less Air Traffic Control \n(ATC) delays which meant the biggest determinant of \nour CSAT score, On Time Performance (OTP), was at \nits highest in years.\nOur customers rate our Crew amongst the friendliest in \nthe skies, with a CSAT score of 96%. \nOur Net Promoter Score (NPS), a metric whereby we \nask customers if they would recommend us to a friend, \nhas remained consistent at 11 during FY22. Ryanair\u2019s \nNPS has grown by 20% over the past three years.\nCUSTOMER EXPERIENCE FORUM \nWe also recently established a Customer Experience \nForum, made up of senior stakeholders from \nacross the business. The forum meets monthly to \nreview feedback from our CSAT survey and identify \nmeaningful actions, to improve our customer\u2019s \nexperience.\n*to FY22 Year End\n35 2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT    AVIATION WITH PURPOSEInflight experience 90%\nPunctuality 92%\nChoice of destinations 90%96%Crew friendliness89%ReliabilityOverall Customer Satisfaction 89%Customer Satisfaction score out of 100:\nApp rating 4/5OUR APPROACH ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL CUSTOMERS APPENDIX", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_RYAAY_2022.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
