Our active ownership activities include: \nEngagement: \nThis involves dialogue with companies on ESG issues to better \nunderstand how they manage risks and comply with the standards \nset out in our Responsible Investment (RI) policies. \nVoting:  \nWe have the right to vote at shareholder meetings of companies in \nwhich we have an equity investment. We vote to promote good ESG \npractices, strong corporate performance and stable returns for our \nclients.\nExclusions: \nAegon Asset Management excludes companies that do not comply \nwith certain standards set out in our RI policies or if directed to do so \nby clients. 13. Active Ownership Engagement\nWe believe engagement is an effective strategy to mitigate ESG risk. Engagement involves \nusing our ownership position to make sure companies are aligned with our RI policies.\nWhile it is difficult to measure the direct impact of individual \nengagements, academic research shows that strong investor \nstewardship can positively affect ESG performance and influence \ncorporate decision-making. Engagement works in several ways. \nIt helps identify new risks and issues important to shareholders. \nIt shows how other companies and sectors manage risk, and how \ninvestors perceive a company\u2019s strategy. Generally, we believe \nengagement is more effective than excluding companies from \ninvestment. \nWe see three basic reasons for engagement:\nPolicy-based engagement\nWe engage with companies that fail to comply with our RI \npolicies. For the most part, this means companies that are non-\ncompliant with the UN Global Compact, as determined by our \nESG research provider. In 2017, we held engagements with 29 \ncompanies on human rights, environmental, governance, and \nlabor issues. \nFinancial risk-based engagement\nThese engagements focus on companies where an ESG factor \nor factors may pose a material financial risk. Usually, these \nengagements are recommended by analysts after analyzing \nESG ratings and performance, or by the RI team, who may, in \nconsultation with the relevant portfolio manager or analyst, \nhighlight companies with a particularly poor ESG performance.\nThematic engagement\nWe also engage with companies on specific issues that we \nconsider strategic. To do so, we take part in workshops, \nresearch projects and collaborative platforms. We consult with \nacademics, NGOs and industry groups and partnerships such as \nthe Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), the \nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI), Eumedion, Farm \nAnimal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR), Ceres and ShareAction. \nThis year we participated in a number of engagements to help \nsupport efforts on climate change. \nWith all engagement, our goal is to deepen our understanding of \nESG issues and improve the performance of companies in which \nwe invest.Engagement in 2017\nIn 2017, Aegon Asset Management engaged with \n335 companies. Of these engagements, 40% related to \nenvironmental and social issues, up from 30% the\nprevious year, due to our increasing participation in\nthematic engagements. The remaining engagements\nrelated to corporate governance issues.\nEngagement Topic\nNext steps in engagement: \nGoing forward, we would like to put more \nemphasis on what has been called \u201cpre-\ncompetitive collaboration26\u201d.  This involves \nsmall groups of long-term institutional \ninvestors working together to achieve positive \nsocial impact. Engagement is usually focused \non industries where there is a high degree of \ncommon ownership. Our work with the steel \nindustry, the PRI and credit rating agencies (see \npages 58 and 31) provides examples of this, and \nis a good basis for further initiatives. \n26 E.g.
