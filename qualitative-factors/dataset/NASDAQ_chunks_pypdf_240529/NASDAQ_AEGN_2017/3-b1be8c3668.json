The Future of Responsible Investment at\nAegon Asset Management\nAt Aegon Asset Management, we\u2019re already doing so. We\u2019re \nactive participants in the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability \nLeadership (CISL) Investment Leaders Group, looking for ways \nfor investors to collaborate on sustainability matters. With other \ninvestors we\u2019re supporting research by the Newsweek Vantage \norganization into \u201cThe Future of ESG Investing\u201d.  We\u2019ve also been \nactive supporters of the Impact Management Project initiated by \nBridges Ventures that we believe will set a new industry standard \nfor impact investing.\nWe are also committed to further developing the responsible \ninvestment \u201ctoolbox\u201d, by continuing to rigorously implement our \nResponsible Investment (RI) Framework and the lessons we\u2019ve \nlearnt.\nIn ESG integration, we\u2019ve found the \u201cESG Next\u201d approach (see \nbelow), to be very useful; we\u2019re looking to apply it across more of \nour asset classes and investment teams.\nIn engagement, we\u2019ve had good results by focusing on just a few \nthemes and sectors, working collaboratively with other investors \nand industry representatives. We\u2019ll also be futher developing this \napproach in the months ahead.\nIn impact investment, we can make a significant contribution by \nsharing our expertise, enabling investors with different risk-return \nprofiles to invest and encouraging new flows of capital to areas \nwhere it is most needed. We also want to dig deeper into how \nthe UN\u2019s SDGs can be used as a tool to guide, and report on, \ninvestments.Given the increasing importance clients place on these topics, \nwe also recognize the need to have the appropriate capacity, \ncapabilities and tools to incorporate these factors into our \ninvestment processes. \nFinally, we have a role in the wider industry debate. Joining \ntask forces, leading industry associations and cross-border \ncollaborations such as the CISL Investment Leaders\u2019 Group, and \nspeaking with government representatives, to share lessons from \nour responsible investment work, is essential to helping develop \na policy environment conducive to more sustainable financial \nmarkets.\nTherefore we strongly endorse the \u201cnew way of working \ntogether\u201d \u2013 proposed by the European Commission \u2013 to help find \nprojects and solutions that improve people\u2019s well-being and bring \nabout a more equitable, sustainable world. \nRoelie van Wijk-Russchen\nGlobal Head of Responsible Business and Public Affairs\nHarald Walkate\nGlobal Head of Responsible Investment\n\"We strongly endorse the \u201cnew way of working together\u201d proposed by\n the European Commission- to help find projects and solutions that improve\n people\u2019s well-being and bring about a more equitable, sustainable world.\"In recent years, there has been growing willingness across the financial industry to \nembrace sustainability. However, we have yet to see significant shifts in the way \nthat investments are made. Global challenges, as summarized in the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), remain and the expectations that investors will contribute \nto solving them are higher than ever. At Aegon Asset Management, we are committed \nto contribute, but we realize that many of the tools at our disposal \u2013 ESG2 integration, \nengagement, impact investment \u2013 are imperfect and require further work to be truly \neffective. We also realize this is something no investor, no single player, can achieve on its \nown: to have real impact, we need to join forces globally. \n2 ESG refers to Environmental, Social and Governance.
