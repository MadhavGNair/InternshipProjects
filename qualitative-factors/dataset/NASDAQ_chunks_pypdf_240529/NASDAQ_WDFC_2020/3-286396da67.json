{"page_content": " WD-40 COMPANY ESG REPORT: LIVING OUR VALUES  \n 2 CEO M ESSAGE  \nG\u2019day Stakeholders:  \nAt WD -40 Company we value doing the right thing and believe that taking an \nintegrated approach to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues \ncontributes to creating long -term value for our stockholders and for all our \nstakeholders. While we have f or decades  operated our business in a sustainable \nmanner , we have never formally shared our activities across environmental and \nsocial factors  until now . As a culture, we focus quietly and purposefully on doing the \nright thing, but we have never made a con scious effort to share our stories related \nto ESG  with our wider circles of stakeholders.  Yet it has become increasingly clear \nthat both internal and external stakeholders want to know more  about our ESG \nefforts . \nWe chose Living Our Values  as the theme of our inaugural ESG Report because our values are the heart and soul \nof our company, our culture, and our brands. Our value of \u201cdo ing the right thing\u201d started us down th is path now \nknown as ESG decades ago. In the context of ESG, \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d means that the well -being of our \nemployees , the safety of our products  in the hands of our customers and end  users , and minimizing our impacts \non the natural environment  have long been at the forefront of our concerns and actions.   \nThrough the creation of this report , we learned that our tribe members feel passionately about the topic of ESG. \nIn fact, the contents in this report were created primarily by a tribe -member led ESG T eam who took on the \nadditional responsibilities of contributing to this report - not because it was part of their job description - but \nbecause they feel transparency on ESG topics is important to our business, to society, and to them personally. I \nwant to thank the tribe members who contributed their time and talent to make this report a reality.   \nThe path to publication of this report, although long and arduous , was an exciting journey of discovery for us.   In \nfiscal year 2018, we established a cross- regional, cross -functional ESG Team and completed an ESG External \nBenchmark Study  to better understand the  environmental and social topics within our business.  In fiscal year 2019, \nthe ESG Team completed an ESG Materiality Assessment , which helped us to  determine th ree primary  ESG topics  \nwe would focus on in this report: our tribe , our products  and our sourcing and supply chain relations . In fiscal year \n2020, the ESG Team completed  both  a Life Cycle Assessment  screening of our flagship product, WD- 40 Multi -\nUse Product, and the publication of this report.   \nThis report sets out the foundation upon which we will build and refine our ESG strategy going forward, including setting specific goals, targets, and the tactics to achieve them. We have made a commitment to report on our ESG activities every two years. Our next report will include information on the ESG goals and targets that we set and our performance in working towards those goals and targets.   \nWe are committed to operating in a sustainable manner and being a responsible corporate citizen for the benef it \nof our customers, end users, investors, tribe members, the natural environment , and the communities in which we \nlive and work.   \nTo a bright future , \n \nGarry O. Ridge  \nChief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WDFC_2020.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
