Our tribe  members take it upon \nthemselves at a deeply personal and professional level to perpetuate our culture as we grow and \nevolve through inevitable changes. Without the  tribe \u2019s collective engagement and commitment to \nliving our values and tribal attributes, the company would not have achieved our growth objectives \nover the decades, nor would we likely be able to  do so  in the future.   \nWe are a learning culture invested in  strengthening our tribe  from within through learning and \ndevelopment .

We do not segregate educational opportunities, with the knowledge \nthat while people have different roles, all are equ al, deserving of respect and dignity, and capable \nof teaching each other no matter how many years of experience they have or what role they may \nfulfill.  \n \nOur internal educational facilitators, or \u201cfaculty\u201d as we call them, have the privilege of paying our \nlearning and development forward to our local communities by delivering customized training to \nour valued distributors in each trading bloc , to non -profits in San Diego , including The San Diego \nFoundation,  where our primary  corporate offices are  located,  and to youth development programs \nand conferences around the world. Leaders from our largest and most long- term United States  \naerosol fillers, can producers,  and logistic providers are invited to join our Leadership Laborato ry \ncohorts to raise our collective leadership competency across our value chain.
