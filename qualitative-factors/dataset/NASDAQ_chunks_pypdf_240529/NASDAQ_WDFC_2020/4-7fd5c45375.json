The unique formula for WD -40 Company\u2019s \nnow iconic WD -40 \u00ae Multi -Use Product  was created through the persist ent quest to solve a \nchallenging problem in the beginning days of the aerospace industry.  \n \nIn the early 1950\u2019s, the fledgling aerospace industry in San Diego was plagued by seaside air that \ncorroded the parts of new planes and missiles . Although three res earchers at Rocket Chemical \nCompany believed they could develop a formula that would inhibit such corrosion, the solution stubbornly eluded  them. Undeterred, they persisted where others might have given up.  They \nconducted studies on 39 separate formulae in  search of the perfect water displacing formula to \nprevent rust and corrosion . Finally, on the 40\nth try, the formula succeeded! Thus, WD -40 (water \ndisplacement - the 40th formula) was born \u2014a secret formulation that to this day solves multiple \neveryday problems, makes things work smoothly, and extends the life of tools and equipment in \nhomes, factories, and workshops in more than 176 countries and territories worldwide.    \n WD-40 Mult i-Use Product became so successful across America that in 1969 Rocket Chemical \nCompany changed its name to WD -40 Company and international expansion followed rapidly \nthereafter.  Our namesake product is n ow joined by our WD-40 Specialist\n\u00ae line of maintenan ce \nproducts and an array of other maintenance , homecare , and cleaning products  developed or \nacquired since 1995 . WD -40 Company  owns  a wide range of trusted brands including  WD-40 \u00ae ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WDFC_2020.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
