{"page_content": " WD-40 COMPANY ESG REPORT: LIVING OUR VALUES  \n 24 We provide competitive time -off programs and allow flexibility in work scheduling wherever \nregulatory guidelines allow.  \n \nIn the U nited States , we are particularly proud of our vacation donation program for tribe  members \nwho experience extenuating personal or family -related emergencies that require them to be away \nfrom work for extended periods of time , and they have depleted their earned time off . When the \ncall goes out to the tribe  for vacation donations, the request is often filled within minutes . That is \nhow a tribe  of people with shared beliefs and genu ine care for one another respond to instances \nof need.  \n \nDiversity and Gender  Equality   \nFindings from a detailed gender and pay study  we conducted  in 2020 indicate s that no systemic \nrelationship exists in WD -40 Company between gender and pay , as measured by position in salary \nranges\u2014 either globally or within our larger population countries.  We did find that t here is a \ncorrelation between tenure in the company and pay, which is as predicted, given our strategy of \ncompensating for competency and contribution s (results).   Over time, tribe  members who are \nsuccessful in advancing their abilities with the associated improved results, will earn pay \nadjustments to recognize their value in the market.  \n \nWe also studied a six -year history of  pay changes to assess whether gender was related to rate of \npay increases (2014 -2020). Our results showed that in the Americas (which includes our corporate \ntribe members), women received higher cumulative pay adjustments over the period  of time we \nstudie d. In Asia -Pacific and EMEA , males received higher cumulative pay increases . While the \ndifferences exist, they are not statistically significant given the small populations represented.  \n \nBeyond statistical analyses, and because our population size is not great, we completed further \nstudy , person -by-person , to examine  pay differences to determine if there were occasions of \ncompensation decisions not being based on job -related criteria . This qualitative study identified no \nbiased decision -making, as the differences were explainable by job -related criteria . We will \ncontinue to  conduct  equitable pay studies and include results  in future  ESG report s. \n \nWorkplace Well -Being  \nWe prioritize the well -being, health, safety, and productivity of our \ntribe . In the wake of the global COVID -19 pandemic, the health, \nsafety, and well -being of our tribe  has never been more important. \nAround the world our tribe \u2019s ability to navigate our business from \nthe comfort of their homes while staying healthy, connected, agile,  \nand productive has been  truly remarkable.  \n \nTribe  members working in our offices enjoy renovated, efficient, \ncollaborative, down -to-earth, minimalistic, high- tech office s. We \nhave invested in recent years to renovate nearly all our locations.  \nWe have purchased and redesigned our headquarters building  \nlocation  in San Diego , California as well as our European subsidiary \nheadquarters located in Milton Keynes,  United Kingdom.   \n  \nTribe members in our Technical \nCenter initiated the donation of \n3,000 nitrile gloves to local \nhospitals  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WDFC_2020.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
