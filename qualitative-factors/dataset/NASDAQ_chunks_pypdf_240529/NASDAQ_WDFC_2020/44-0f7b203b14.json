This includes individual ingredient contribution, combination \ningredient contributions, proper use, packaging and all necessary actions and information to \nmaximize our end user \u2019s safety while using the product.  \n\u2022 A Safety Data Sheet  (\u201cSDS\u201d) that provides comprehensive information about a substance or \nmixture for  use in workplace chemical management. In the United States, the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration ( \u201cOSHA \u201d) has adopted the new Globally Harmonized System \nof Classification and Labeling of Chemicals ( \u201cGHS \u201d).
