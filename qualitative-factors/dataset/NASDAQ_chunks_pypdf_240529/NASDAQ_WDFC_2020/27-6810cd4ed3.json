We are a self -sustaining collection of diverse, passionate , \nand values -aligned individuals from all corners of the world. Throughout the organization, tribe  \nmembers promote a culture of inclusion in  all our interactions because quite simply, it is living our \nvalue of \u201c doing the right thing. \u201d  \n \nWe focus our approach to diversity , equality and inclusion on what unites rather than what \nseparates us:   \n\u2022 Everybody in our company is included in our tribe , without exception  \n\u2022 We focus on similarities and common ground, not differences  \n\u2022 We maximize the unique value of each tribe  member , and the tribe  as a whole , through  \nrespectful and supportive interactions  \n\u2022 We consciously acknowledge, identify  and address our unconscious biases  \n\u2022 We conduct formal educational workshops on \u201cThe Psychology of Inclusion ,\u201d helping us all \nidentify our unconscious biases and how to eliminate th em \n\u2022 As stated earlier in this section, we are a meritocracy , focused on observable, job -related \nbehavior as a basis for employment -related decisions  \n\u2022 We celebrate and share our tribe \u2019s many  cultures, languages, traditions, sports, holidays, and \nso much more  \n To us, inclusion is an organization- wide opportunity because all human beings need to feel \nincluded to truly engage. Living our purpose of creating positive lasting memories in everything we \ndo is built on, and nurtured through, a strong sense of belonging that is authentically inclusive . \nHere again, we have not \u201carrived .\u201d  While we\u2019ve made progress, we have a long way to go to be \nsatisfied that our company truly represents the diversity of the communities in which we operate.  \n \nWe believe that most people do their best work when they are on diverse teams. When diversity \nof thought is absent, there is a lower rate of creativity  which can, at times, result in a self -validating \necho -chambe r.  This causes reduction in critical thinking, creativity, innovation , and problem \nsolving.  Yet another reason for inclusivity.  \n \n  \n\u201cVaried perspectives result in creative solutions, solutions that might not otherwise emerge when disparate \nviews are suppressed. Varied cultural exchanges enrich the lives of all concerned, which makes the time we \nspend at work that much more rewarding and enjoyable. That causes engagement, which means the \napplication of each person\u2019s discretionary efforts to the highest degree. \u201d  \n- Garry Ridge, CEO and Chairman ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WDFC_2020.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
