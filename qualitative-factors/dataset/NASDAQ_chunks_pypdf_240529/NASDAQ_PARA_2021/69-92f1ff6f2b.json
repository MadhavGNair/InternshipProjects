At the same time, \nwe have found success signing new licensees \nwith an established approach to managing \ntheir environmental footprint.\nWe added new sustainable packaging \nlanguage into approximately 20 new apparel \ncontracts, helping to reduce packaging waste, \nparticularly the use of virgin single-use plastic. \nOur Consumer Products team has also been \nworking with some partners in our accessories \nlines to right-size packaging, helping to \nincrease efficiency and reduce unnecessary \npackaging waste.Many of our partners are looking to  \nreduce ink usage on their packaging, \nwhether to be more environmentally \nresponsible or simply to reduce costs.  \nTo support these partners, we are  \npreparing to release alternative  \npackaging guidelines, beginning with \nthe PAW Patrol brand. Partners who \ncan demonstrate that they have made \nmeaningful improvements can include \ncertifications they have earned from  \nexternal organizations and other relevant  \ncall-outs on packaging. Going forward,  \nwe will be incorporating options for \nalternative printing techniques into most  \nof our packaging guides.SpongeBob and  \nOperation Sea Change\nCreated by a marine biologist, \nSpongeBob SquarePants has always had \na deep love for the ocean at its core. \nIn 2022, Paramount will launch a multi-year \ninitiative to protect ocean ecosystems and \nconnect to the heart of the SpongeBob \nstory. The Operation Sea Change initiative \naims to divert and clean up millions of \npounds of ocean plastic, while engaging \nfans and the public on key ocean \nrestoration issues.\nAs we build out this initiative, we will \npublish and measure goals to divert \nand clean up ocean plastic and engage \nwith licensing partners on how we can \ncollectively reduce the ocean plastic \npollution potential of the SpongeBob \nproduct lineup through several holistic \nstrategies.\nSwimwear line from Operation \nSea Change partner Seaesta Surf", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_PARA_2021.pdf", "page": 69, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
