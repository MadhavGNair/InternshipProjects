We also have an opportunity to \nuse our voice as a major global company to \nhelp raise sustainability standards across \nthe consumer products industry. We have \ncontinued to prioritize our engagement \nwith our major retail partners and other \norganizations focused on improving \ntransparency and sustainability in supply \nchains, such as the International Council \nof Toy Industries Ethical Toy Program, and \nProducts of Change, an industry group \nfocused on sustainability education and \ncollaboration in the licensing industry.\nAs we move forward, we are monitoring the \nenvironmental and social implications of new \nareas of consumer products, including non-\nfungible tokens (NFTs) and are investigating \nenvironmentally responsible ways to engage \non these products.Establishing Expectations and \nGuidelines\nAll licensees must comply with the Paramount \nSupplier Compliance Policy, which includes \nstrict requirements regarding ethical business \nconduct, labor practices, health and safety, \nconflict minerals, and more. Environmental \nimpacts of our licensed products include \nenergy, water, and material use; GHG \nemissions; and waste associated with \nmanufacturing and distribution, packaging,  \nand end-of-life disposal. \nIn 2021, we convened a Consumer Products \nworking group \u2013 as part of our ESG Council \n\u2013 to find ways to encourage our partners \nto adopt more sustainable manufacturing \npractices, among other strategic areas. We \nare actively engaging external partners and \nsubject matter experts to explore long-term \nsustainability goals for licensed products, \nsuch as encouraging or requiring licensees \nto reduce certain material inputs or to reduce \nemissions from manufacturing and distribution.CONSUMER \nPRODUCTS\nGRI: 417-1\nThe 95th Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade: PAW Patrol", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_PARA_2021.pdf", "page": 68, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
