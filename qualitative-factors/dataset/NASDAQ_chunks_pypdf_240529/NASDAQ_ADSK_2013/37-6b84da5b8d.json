This includes internal as well as external education programs.\nAs a part of the development process, all Autodesk \nemployees receive a formal annual performance review. This includes feedback from coworkers and focuses on \nassessment and feedback against individual goal  \nachievement as well as demonstrated competency  and proficiency.\nIn 2012, Autodesk replaced written performance  \ndocumentation with a digital process. This saves about \n30,000 pieces of printed paper each year, while  \neliminating the need to ship these documents to human resources locations worldwide and reducing long-term \nstorage costs.
