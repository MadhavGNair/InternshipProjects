The list price of these versions is usually a \npercentage off the list price of the latest release. We also have a policy of adjusting our list pricing in a number of \ncountries to account for lower purchasing power in those \nlocations relative to more mature markets.\nEmployees\u2014In late 2012, Autodesk began granting \nemployees access to most Autodesk products free of charge. This provides employees\u2014regardless of their \nfunction\u2014a chance to use a variety of Autodesk software \nfor themselves and gain a better understanding of how we help our customers imagine, design, and create a \nbetter world.\nCommunity organizations\u2014In fiscal year 2013, we \ndonated software worth nearly $2.6 million to commu-\nnity efforts, including multiple projects for Habitat for Humanity, rebuilding in the wake of disasters, humani-\ntarian projects, set design for theaters, and as prizes for \nstudent design competitions. Architecture for Humanity was one of our software donation recipients, receiving \n$750,000 worth of software to assist rebuilding efforts in \nareas affected by natural disasters. Information sharing\nWe also strive to facilitate knowledge sharing and expand access to information. For instance, Instructables is an online community where creative people share innova-\ntive projects and ideas, some of it sustainability-related. \nOur employees have joined in, creating Instructables for everything from how to create parabolic solar hot-water \nheaters to the best way to design a garden based on how \nplants will be affected by shadows that the surrounding buildings and trees cast. \nWe also offer a free online resource that teaches the prin-\nciples and practice of sustainability in engineering, architec-\nture, and design. Autodesk Sustainability Workshop uses \nshort, engaging videos as well as case studies and tutorials to illustrate how students and others can easily put com-\nplex concepts into practice with Digital Prototyping and \nBuilding Information Modeling.
