Most of our waste \nvolume is generated during major maintenance projects (turnarounds), plant \nrefurbishments and servicing work. These waste sources include construction-related \nmaterials such as scrap metal, wood waste, piping and vessel insulation. \nWe also responsibly manage our hazardous waste, which is predominantly \u201cspent\u201d catalyst. Catalyst, which consists of small metal-\ncontaining pellets that help promote the chemical reactions required to manufacture methanol, becomes less efficient over time (is \n\u201cspent\u201d), and eventually needs to be replaced. The metal in spent catalyst can sometimes be recovered and reused. See page 17  for \nhow we use catalysts in our production process. \nWaste\n  Non-hazardous waste     Hazardous wastetonnes\n2017 2016 2018 2019 2020Non-hazardous waste \nby destinationHazardous waste \nby destination13%\n87%\n26%\n74%87% Sent to recycling\n13% Sent  for disposal\n26% Sent to recycling\n74% Sent for disposal\n3,275108\n2,409510\n2,513372\n4,426342\n4,493790The majority of hazardous \nwaste in 2020 consisted \nof spent catalyst sent to \napproved facilities for metals \nrecovery. \nMost of our non-hazardous \nwaste volumes in 2020 \nwere generated from two \nmaintenance turnarounds \nand two major projects in \nGeismar and Medicine Hat. \nThe project work resulted in \nincreased volumes of waste \ncompared to previous years.
