Executive compensation is closely tied to Methanex\u2019s financial performance. In 2020, \nmore than 80 per cent of our CEO\u2019s total compensation, and approximately 70 per cent of named executive officers\u2019 total compensation, \nwas based on performance (or \u201cat risk\u201d). Since 2011, we have included an advisory \u201csay on pay\u201d vote at our annual meetings. In addition, \nthe Chair of the Board solicits feedback during annual meetings with institutional shareholders. From mid-March to June 30, we also \nprovide a link on the Investor Relations page of our website to enable such feedback. For more details, see our Information Circular . \nExecutive compensation linked to environmental and social factors:  Thirty per cent of the CEO and named executive officers\u2019 annual \nshort-term incentive award is tied directly to individual performance goals aligned with Methanex\u2019s strategic and operational goals. In \n2020, the CEO\u2019s individual goals related to environmental, social and governance factors included:\n\u2022 Maintaining a strong focus on health, safety and the environment, including:\n \u00bb Staying focused on preventing injuries to our employees and contractors while at work.\n \u00bb Preventing environmental incidents.\n \u00bb Continuing to implement our process safety management program to reduce risks and enhance assurances around process safety.\n \u00bb Continuing to lead product stewardship and Responsible Care initiatives with our customers and terminal partners.\n\u2022 Progressing our Cybersecurity Strategy\n\u2022 Providing regular, clear and consistent two-way communications to all our stakeholders.\n\u2022 Demonstrating our Core Values and One Team culture.\nThe Human Resources Committee is responsible for reviewing the CEO\u2019s individual performance and found that his overall individual \nperformance for 2020 exceeded expectations. However, the CEO declined to receive a short-term incentive for 2020.\nIn 2021, the CEO\u2019s goals relating to environmental, social and governance factors include the above, as well as the following additional goals:\n\u2022 Ensuring the health and well-being of our team members are protected as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022 Progressing the integration of ESG matters in our decision-making throughout the Company.\n\u2022 Progressing diversity and inclusion at Methanex through the establishment of a Diversity and Inclusion Council and a Diversity and \nInclusion Policy, strategy and related action plan.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2020.pdf", "page": 43, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
