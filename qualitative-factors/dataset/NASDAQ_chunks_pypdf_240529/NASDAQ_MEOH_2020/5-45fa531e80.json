In 2020, we conducted \nan internal materiality assessment to update and prioritize the sustainability topics that are most relevant to our business and stakeholders. Topics were sourced from \nrecognized reporting frameworks and reviews of chemical industry peers. Stakeholder perspectives considered during the assessment include those of investors, customers, \nemployees, communities, governments, regulators and supply chain partners. The results of the assessment were reviewed and approved by our Executive Leadership Team \nand the material topics have been covered in this report. We will continue to regularly review our material ESG topics to ensure they reflect stakeholder expectations and the \nchanging business environment. To learn more about how we identify and manage our ESG risks, see the Governance section  page 45 .
