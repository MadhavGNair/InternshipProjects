{"page_content": "ESG R eport 2022\nRISE UP Sickle Cell Disease  \nTrial Recruiting Campaign\nFor more than a year, we have partnered closely with \nsickle cell warriors from around the world to design \na clinical trial that is created by sickle cell warriors, \nfor sickle cell warriors. This included developing the \nstudy protocol, the trial branding and recruitment \ncampaign for our RISE UP study, a Phase 2/3 \nstudy in sickle cell disease. These warriors \nspent months working with us, sharing \ntheir voice that set the direction for the \nproject, brainstorming study branding \nand providing input on the recruitment \ncampaign materials. Importantly, they \nare also the face of the campaign.  \nOur hope was to together create \nsomething that would be meaningful \nto the community and represent their \nresilience in the face of challenges, refusal  \nto settle for the status quo, and influential \nefforts to educate the world about sickle cell \nand close the equality gap in healthcare. \nWhile the RISE UP study is sponsored by \nAgios, it is also a study created for and by \nthe sickle cell community. We view this \nstudy as a pilot initiative and plan to take \nlessons learned to inform our approach to \nrecruit more representative populations in \nfuture clinical trials as well.  Coronavirus Clinical  \nTrial Task Force\nIn February 2020, very early in the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, Agios established \na clinical trial task force to ensure the \nsafety of patients in our clinical trials \nand to support patients on a case-by-\ncase basis to enable their continued \nparticipation in the studies. Since \nthe launch of the task force, we have \nmanaged more than 750 patient \nrequests, allowing for at-home study \nvisits, investigational medicines shipped \nto patients, telemedicine approaches, \nand the use of local laboratories.\nManaged more than  \n750 clinical trial \npatient requests  during \nCOVID-19 pandemicDecentralized Trials Research \nAlliance Founding Member\nAgios is proud to have become a \nfounding member of Decentralized \nTrials Research Alliance (DTRA) as of \nJanuary 2021. DTRA strives to enable \ncollaboration of stakeholders in the \nindustry to accelerate the adoption of \npatient-focused, decentralized clinical \ntrials through education, research and \ncollaboration within the healthcare \ncommunity. Decentralized trials use \nnovel technologies or processes to \ncreate options for participation outside \nof conventional clinical settings, \nimproving convenience and access to \nclinical trials and research for all patient \npopulations, especially those that have \nbeen traditionally ignored or overlooked. \nAgios hopes to leverage the collective \nknowledge of the DTRA to further evolve \nour clinical development approaches  \nand increase diversity and access for  \nour participants.Case Study \nPatient Voice in Clinical Trials\nBlaze, living with sickle cell disease\nTeonna, living with \nsickle cell diseaseTristian, living with \nsickle cell disease\n17", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AGIO_2021.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
