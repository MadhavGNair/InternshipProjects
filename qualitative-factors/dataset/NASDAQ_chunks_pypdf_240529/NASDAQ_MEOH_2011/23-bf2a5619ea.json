{"page_content": "222011 performance report \nHealth and Safety\nWe consider employees and contractors as equals when \nmanaging risks in the workplace. We \ufb01  rmly believe that all work-\nrelated injuries and illnesses are avoidable, and it is on this basis that we design and manage our health and safety programs.\nQuantitative health and safety data is measured, gathered and \nreviewed following internal requirements, which are based on accepted external standards and industry best practices. The internal standard for classi\ufb01  cation of injuries follows the United \nStates Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration \u2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics requirement. Data quality is monitored by regional RC leaders, regional managers and the RC department at corporate head of\ufb01  ce. Data is \ngathered in a global database, from which it is then extracted, analyzed and reported to regional management, the company\u2019s Executive Leadership Team and the Responsible Care Committee of the Board.\nOur goal is to achieve a zero-injury workplace, year after year. \nAnd while we have a decade-long trend of improving employee and contractor safety and health, in 2011  we experienced an \nincreased number of injury-related incidents. While this is disappointing for us, we are working to deepen our understanding of why the injuries occurred and making the changes that will prevent them from happening again. Good neighbours look out for one another.\nAt Methanex, we\u2019re committed to providing a safe and \nhealthy work environment for our employees and contractors. We\u2019re also dedicated to fostering a corporate culture that attracts and retains talented employees by focusing on continuous improvement, teamwork, ongoing learning and recognizing success.workplace", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2011.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
