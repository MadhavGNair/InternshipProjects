At the end of 2011 , over three-quarters of the terminals and customer \nlocations where we deliver methanol had completed an audit based on either the Chemical Distribution Institute\u2019s Terminal (CDI-T) protocol, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum \nprotocol, or a CDI-T approved Methanex terminal pre-screening assessment protocol that highlights the highest CDI-T priorities for methanol handling and Methanex expectations. Since starting our terminal program in 1997 , we have worked closely \nwith customers and terminal operators in all regions to adopt these international standards. We are encouraged by the ongoing improvement of regional RC performance.\nRoad and rail\nIn 2011 , we held trucking-focused methanol safety seminars \nin China, Korea and Egypt that brought together our customers, distributors, end-user customers (and their truck carriers), terminal staff and emergency responders to share their experiences. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2011.pdf", "page": 38, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
