As the largest consumer of natural gas in the region, Methanex came under scrutiny. \nMethanex is deeply committed to being \npart of the energy solution for the region and has signi\ufb01  cantly invested \nin gas exploration efforts in southern Chile. Six international companies, in addition to ENAP , the state-owned oil and gas company, are presently exploring for natural gas in the region to satisfy Methanex\u2019s demand.
