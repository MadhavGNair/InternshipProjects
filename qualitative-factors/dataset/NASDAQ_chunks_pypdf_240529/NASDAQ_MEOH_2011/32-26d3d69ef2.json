{"page_content": "312011 methanex responsible care and social responsibility report\nOur newest facility in Egypt is one of the most energy-ef\ufb01  cient \nmethanol plants in the world. We will be minimizing our environmental footprint at the plant even further when we complete a zero-liquid discharge project that will allow the facility to operate without discharging wastewater into the Mediterranean Sea. To learn more about our 2011  environmental \nefforts at our Egypt plant, please see the story on page 33.\nManaging greenhouse gas emissions \nManaging carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is a signi\ufb01  cant and \nchallenging part of the methanol production process. We aim to minimize emissions from our operations, knowing that this bene\ufb01  ts both the environment and our business.Methanex has manufacturing facilities in New Zealand and \nAlberta, Canada, two jurisdictions that have legislation requiring industrial producers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We also voluntarily participate in efforts to reduce GHG emissions in countries where we do not have legal obligations to do so. Between 1994  and 2011 , we reduced the CO2 emission \nintensity of our manufacturing operations by 30 per cent through asset turnover, improved plant reliability and energy ef\ufb01 ciency and emissions management. Because our overall CO2 \nemission intensity depends on the ef\ufb01  ciency of each methanol \nfacility, it may vary from year to year depending on the asset mix we have in operation.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2011.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
