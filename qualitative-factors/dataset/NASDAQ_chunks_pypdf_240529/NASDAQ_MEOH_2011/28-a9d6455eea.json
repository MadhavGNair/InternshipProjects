At Methanex Chile\u2019s Punta Arenas plant, members of the Human Resources (HR) department have become increasingly aware of how a lack of physical \ufb01  tness, \ncoupled with a low level of activity, predisposes individuals to injuries and health challenges.\nIn 2011 , the HR team began developing a holistic health program \nto bolster employees\u2019 well-being and help them get in shape. In addition to recognizing the cumulative strain of certain jobs, the team realized that age could be a factor. The median age of the plant\u2019s work teams is 44 years, with statistics suggesting a po-tential decline in productivity due to physical factors associated with aging. The team also knew from its own records that health care expenses tend to increase as work groups get older.\nWorking with the Responsible Care department and a multi-\ndisciplinary group of \ufb01  tness experts, the team designed an \ninitiative entitled \u201cFitness to Work.\u201d The program focuses on three main areas: \u2022 Occupational health, which identi\ufb01  es people at high risk due \nto their physical state and/or exposure through the physically demanding nature of their work. Participants are coached on physical \ufb01  tness and nutrition.\n\u2022 Prevention practices for health conditions and personal care, \nsuch as doing more exercise and eating healthier food during work hours. \n\u2022 Ergonomics, which highlights the adjustments the company \nmust make to accommodate the physical changes that accompany aging. \nThe \ufb01  rst phase of \u201cFitness to Work\u201d was successfully implemented \nin mid- 2011 . Participating employees have already shown a 65 \nper cent improvement in their physical condition and an almost 50 per cent improvement in their nutrition habits. The goal is to further expand the scope of the program to mitigate future risks to employees\u2019 health and safety.\nTop: Methanex Trinidad\u2019s \nCORE program uses videos to inform employees about safe behaviours, such as proper hand protection.\nRight: A multi-disciplinary \nteam of health and \ufb01  tness \nexperts worked with Methanex Chile employees to develop the innovative \u201cFitness to Work\u201d initiative.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2011.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
