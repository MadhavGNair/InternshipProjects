{"page_content": "232011 methanex responsible care and social responsibility report\nThe addition of a signi\ufb01  cant number of new employees \nin Egypt and Canada, coupled with a decrease in quali\ufb01  ed \nand experienced contractors, has had an impact on our safety performance. \nTo address the shortage of experienced contractors, \nwe are working with technical education providers to establish programs that will equip workers with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in this work environment. One example is the \u201cBe Safe, Taranaki\u201d program in New Zealand, where local industry, including Methanex, provides funding to support a health, safety and environment curriculum for prospective new workers. The New Zealand Quali\ufb01  cation Authority oversees the \nquality of the course materials and instruction. \nAlthough these initiatives are still in the early stages, \nwe are con\ufb01  dent that they will improve contractors\u2019 \ntechnical skills and job safety. We have also taken spe-ci\ufb01 c lessons learned from contractor-related incidents \nand changed how we manage contractors at our sites. These changes are now re\ufb02  ected in our Contractor Re-\nsponsible Care Standard to ensure that this knowledge is embedded across the company.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2011.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
