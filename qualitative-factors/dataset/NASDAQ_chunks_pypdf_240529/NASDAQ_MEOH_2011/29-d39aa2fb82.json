{"page_content": "28The recordable injury frequency rate (RIFR)  is the \nnumber of recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked. Recordable injuries are incidents that require medical attention or that result in restricted work or lost time. SHARE (Safety and Health Analysis, Recognition and Exchange) is a database compiled by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC). Methanex benchmarks against the average and \ufb01  rst \nquartile Group III member companies of the CIAC whose employees collectively work more than one million hours per year.The incident severity ratio  describes the ratio of \nsigni\ufb01  cant and near-miss incidents with high \npotential for loss being reported as compared to the total incidents reported. An increasing ratio number would indicate increasing job risk, while a decreasing ratio number would indicate decreasing job risk.\nIncident Severity Ratio2011 performance report > workplace \nKey Performance Indicators\nTotal Incidents Reported\n% Signi\ufb01  cant Incidents\n% High Potential Near-miss Incidents\nCIAC Employee Group III Average\nCIAC Employee Group III First Quartile\nMethanex Employee RIFREmployee Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (RIFR) Comparison\nIn 2011,  we added a signi\ufb01  cant number of new employees to our organization \nwith the start-up of our Medicine Hat and Egypt facilities.
