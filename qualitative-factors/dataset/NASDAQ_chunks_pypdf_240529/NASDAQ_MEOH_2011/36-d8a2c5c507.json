First, there was a large increase in purchased sodium hypochlorite in our Trinidad and Tobago site resulting from a breakdown in on-site generation equipment. This equipment has now been repaired. Second, our restarted plant in Medicine Hat has a higher usage rate of acid and caustic used in the production of demineralized water, impacting the corporate average.\nData refers to consumption of chemicals used for pH control \nand for water treatment.Global Chemical Consumption\nChemical Added (million kg)\nChemical to Methanol Ratio (kg/tonne)1.2\n0.81.0\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0chemical added (million kg)\nchemical to methanol ratio (kg / tonne)\n2007 2008 2009 2010 20113\n2\n1\n0456", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2011.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
