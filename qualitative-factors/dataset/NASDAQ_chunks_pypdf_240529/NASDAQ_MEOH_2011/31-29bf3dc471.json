{"page_content": "302011 performance report \nAs part of our commitment to Responsible Care, we go beyond \ncomplying with regulations \u2013 we follow best environmental practices in all aspects of methanol production and distribution at all our locations. We promote this ethic with our customers, distributors, partners, employees and other stakeholders.\nIn 2011 , we started production at facilities in Medicine Hat, \nCanada, and Damietta, Egypt. While the technical start-up of the two plants was generally a smooth process, we did experience some challenges. Prior to 2011 , Methanex had \na strong track record of nearly \ufb01  ve straight years without \nan environmental exceedance at any of our sites. Last year, unfortunately, we had two permit exceedances in Medicine Hat. Although these incidents were not severe and did not \ncause any environmental damage, we are using them as an opportunity to review the underlying causes and take action to ensure they will not occur again. \nA signi\ufb01  cant portion of the $50 million we spent to resume \nproduction at our Medicine Hat plant was allocated to environmental upgrades to protect soil and groundwater, reduce methanol emissions and conserve water. We always strive to improve our environmental performance, and we are analyzing additional opportunities to improve ef\ufb01  ciency and \nreduce resource use.Good neighbours take care of the environment.\nOur respect for the environment guides every operating \ndecision, spurring us to minimize our use of natural resources and energy and to reduce our production of waste and harmful emissions. environment", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2011.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
