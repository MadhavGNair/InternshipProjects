The facility is also a source of jobs for local residents, currently employ-ing 450 Egyptian full-time employees and contractors. \nEgypt\u2019s political revolution in January 2011  \nwas accompanied by regional protests in Damietta. These protests, primarily about local environmental issues, focused at-tention on Damietta\u2019s port area industrial facilities. In response, the Environment Minister established a special committee to conduct an environmental assessment of Damietta\u2019s petrochemical industry, including the EMethanex plant. \nThe committee presented its recom-\nmendations in October 2011 . In late 2011 , \nEMethanex informed the committee that a majority of its recommendations were be-ing or had already been implemented as \npart of our normal course of business. \nOne of the committee\u2019s recommenda-\ntions was to ensure that no industrial ef\ufb02 uent water was discharged to \nthe Mediterranean Sea. Although EMethanex\u2019s ef\ufb02  uent discharge had been \npermitted by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) and consistently met parameters set out in the Environ-mental Impact Assessment, EMethanex decided prior to the committee\u2019s report to pursue a zero liquid discharge (ZLD) solution that will eliminate liquid discharge into the sea. \nThis technology will also reduce the \nplant\u2019s consumption of water, which is drawn from the Nile River a few kilometres from where it \ufb02  ows into the \nMediterranean Sea. Despite the high investment cost, EMethanex is pursuing ZLD largely because it aligns with the local community\u2019s and company\u2019s interests. This will be our \ufb01  rst ZLD \nplant, and we expect the project to be operational in Q1 2013 . \nThe EEAA has approved EMethanex\u2019s \nresponse to the committee, and we remain dedicated to working with our government partners and the local community to address environmental and other concerns. For more information about our community engagement efforts in Damietta, please seepages 12 \u2013 13. \n\u201cThe Taranaki Regional Council \nhas worked with Methanex \nsince 1993 . Methanex routinely \nplaces in the Council\u2019s highest \ncategory of compliance and environmental performance, \ngoing well beyond minimum \nconsent requirements. \nIn 2011 , in addition to being \nin full compliance with water \ndischarge requirements, \nthe company proactively \nconstructed an on-site sewage \ntreatment facility at its \nWaitara Valley plant. This is \nan example of how Methanex \ncontinually seeks to minimize \nits environmental footprint on \nthe local community.\u201d\nGary Bedford\nDirector, Environment Quality\nTaranaki Regional Council\nLeft: We are implementing technology at our EMethanex facility that will help reduce the consumption of water and eliminate liquid discharge into the Mediterranean Sea.\nOpposite Page: The newly \ninstalled sewage treatment plant at Methanex New Zealand\u2019s Waitara Valley site prevents any waste disposal into local ocean waters. \nWhat Others Say", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2011.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
