In conjunction with our Gold Level partnership \nwith the National Center for Responsible Gaming (NCRG), \nour Company has established a comprehensive  \nframework to promote a culture of responsible gambling \nthroughout our organization.\nPenn National maintains a Corporate Responsible  \nGaming Committee to oversee its responsible gaming \nprograms and regularly consults with the NCRG  \nand other partner responsible gaming organizations. \nThe Committee\u2019s goals include:\n \u2022Promoting a culture of responsible gaming.\n \u2022Establishing minimum responsible gaming \nrelated policies and procedures including the \nestablishment of programs to allow patrons to \nself-exclude and setting up financial restrictions  \nand marketing restrictions.\n \u2022Overseeing ongoing reporting by property- \nbased Responsible Gaming Committees at \neach Penn National property.\n \u2022Preventing underage gambling and  \nunattended minors in casinos.\n \u2022Serving alcoholic beverages responsibly.\n \u2022Advertising responsibly.\n \u2022Training team members on responsible gaming.\n \u2022Supporting and promoting research-based \npolicies on responsible gaming.\n \u2022Providing ongoing oversight and review of \ncompliance with all responsible gaming  \npolicies and programs. \nThis Committee meets quarterly and consists of senior \nPenn National executives, including our President & \nCEO, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer,and \nsenior executives in Human Resources, Marketing, \nInternal Audit, as well as its Senior Vice Presidents of \nRegional Operations.\nThe Penn National Corporate Responsible Gaming \nCommittee has established a comprehensive Corporate \nResponsible Gaming Program (\u201cCorporate RG Program\u201d) \nbased on the American Gaming Association\u2019s (\u201cAGA\u201d) \nCode of Conduct for Responsible Gaming to meet the \ngoals described above and that governs all of its casino \nfacilities and online products.As required by the Corporate RG Program, each  \nindividual Penn National property maintains a property  \nResponsible Gaming Committee, chaired by the  \nproperty general manager, that sets property responsible \ngaming standards in accordance with Corporate RG \nProgram standards, NCRG recommended practices and \nthe AGA\u2019s Code of Conduct. In addition, Penn National\u2019s \ninternal audit department conducts regular responsible \ngaming audits at each property to ensure compliance \nwith established responsible \ngaming standards.\nIn addition, to address our \nInteractive Division\u2019s patrons, \nour Company has developed \na robust responsible  \ngaming program, including \n0t registration. Part of a \nregistrant\u2019s information is \nchecked through a database \nof public records to confirm \nthe individual\u2019s information \nand identity. Only upon  \nverifying an identity is an individual allowed to deposit \ninto their sports betting or online casino account and \nwager when physically  \nlocated in a legally approved jurisdiction. There is no \nanonymous gaming on our online gaming offerings.\nBeyond its gatekeeping measures, Company online \noperations provide customers with a number of services  \nto promote responsible gaming.

Players can set \nvarious monetary limits in an effort to stay within their \nbudget. This includes deposit, single wager, and total  \nwager (daily, weekly, or monthly) limits. Our online  \nofferings further provide the option of setting time limits, \nwhich prevent players from logging into their account for \n24 hours after the voluntarily set time limit is met. In  \naddition, players can set a \u201ccheck-in\u201d alert that will notify  \na player when they have been active on the app for a  \ncertain amount of time. \nTo further promote responsible gaming, there are waiting  \nperiods of 24 hours, seven days, and one month to in -\ncrease or remove limits, aimed at preventing a  \nvulnerable player from changing responsible gaming \nsettings impulsively. In addition, players can set a timeout \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_PENN_2020.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
