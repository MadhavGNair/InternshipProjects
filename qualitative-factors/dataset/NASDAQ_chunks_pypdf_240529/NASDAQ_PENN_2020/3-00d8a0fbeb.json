For example, at Hollywood Casino St. Louis, \nwhich features a 502-room hotel, we\u2019ve reduced plastic \nbottle use by 91% \u2014 or 550 pounds annually \u2014 which \ntranslates to nearly $50,000 in annual savings for that \nhotel alone. In addition, replacing paper towels with \nelectric hand dryers and using core-less toilet paper rolls \nat the casino has led to a reduction of 22,000 pounds of \npaper waste annually there. \nIn an effort to conserve water, most of our hotel locations \nencourage guests to participate in linen and towel reuse \nprograms. Behind the scenes, low-flow fittings and \nefficient use of laundry facilities help further curb water \nwaste. \nWe currently have robust recycling programs in place  \nat most of our properties nationwide (with plans to  \nfurther expand the program), diverting recyclable  \nmaterials produced by the casino and hotel operations \naway from landfills. Composting facilities, currently im-\nplemented at five locations, allow even more waste to be redirected. Additional waste reduction efforts  \nat select properties \u2014 such as the use of plant-based \nand paper straws, the replacement of paper towels with  \nelectric hand dryers, and the elimination of Styrofoam \u2014\nhelp further reduce waste directly at the source.  \nThese types of broad sustainability programs are  \ndesigned to eliminate over 25,000 pounds of waste \nannually at each property.\nAdditionally, our operations and IT teams have laid  \nthe groundwork for implementing a new generation \nof cashless, cardless and contactless technology at \nour casinos, which we refer to as the 3Cs, that will help \nto eliminate a significant amount of plastic and paper \nwaste from membership cards and printed tickets  \nfrom our slot machines, self-serve kiosks and ATMs.  \nIt will also lead to an ongoing reduction of direct mail  \nto consumers. We intend to launch this technology  \ninitially at our Pennsylvania casinos in the first half  \nof 2021, subject to regulatory approval, and plan to  \ncontinue rolling it out to other regions in 2021.\nPenn National Gaming Casino and Hotel \u2014 Energy Efficiency Projects\nESG \u2014 KWh Reduction, Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Carbon Footprint Reduction Annually\nLocationsTotal KWH  \nAnnually 2019LED Lighting  \nRetrofits & Total  \nKWH ReductionAnnual % of KWH  \nReductionGreenhouse Gas  \nEmissions Reduction \n(Tons)1Equivalent from \nswitching to LED  \nfrom incandescent  \nlight bulbs1Carbon-Free Power  \nGeneration w/ \nConstellation Energy \nCharles Town\nAurora\nGrantville\nTunica\nRiverside\nJoliet\nDayton\nTropicana\nZia Park \nColumbus\nYoungstown\nLawrenceburg\nKC Speedway \n1st Jackpot\nBoomtown Bilioxi\nM Resort\nPlainridge\nL\u2019Auberge Baton Rouge\nBay St. Louis\nSt. Louis\nBangor\nToledo\nCouncil Bluffs-Iowa\nAmeristar-East Chicago\nL\u2019Auberge Lake Charles\nBoomtown New Orleans\nBlack Hawk-Colorado\nTotal32,063,541\n10,873,000\n25,368,000\n15,054,000\n15,429,999\n17,819,000\n8,705,000\n26,589,948\n5,779,145\n19,404,000\n9,025,000\n15,624,000\n17,652,900\n6,894,000\n11,879,764\n26,023,496\n9,812,000\n24,435,629\n14,500,000\n27,926,410\n9,471,000\n20,875,000\n17,936,825\n23,696,400\n39,873,314\n14,687,859\n19,412,028\n486,811,2584,910,806\n1,555,303\n1,053,204\n2,350,355\n3,814,101\n3,041,119\n508,560\n5,383,320\n64,743\n2,174,040\n421,497\n2,229,072\n1,510,210\n727,032\n1,142,208\n1,719,828\n1,459,476\n1,130,776\n2,631,420\n1,242,445\n2,423,952\n1,737,845\n1,043,700\n2,376,590\n2,171,115\n1,142,892\n2,412,270\n52,377,87915%\n14%\n4%\n16%\n25%\n17%\n6%\n20%\n1%\n11%\n5%\n14%\n9%\n11%\n10%\n7%\n15%\n5%\n18%\n4%\n26%\n8%\n6%\n10%\n5%\n8%\n12%\n11%3,827\n1,212\n821\n1,832\n2,973\n2,370\n396\n4,196\n51\n1,694\n329\n1,737\n1,177\n567\n890\n1,340\n1,137\n881\n2,051\n968\n1,889\n1,354\n813\n1,852\n1,692\n891\n1,880\n40,820131.905\n41,776\n28,289\n63,131\n102,447\n81,685\n13,660\n144,597\n1,739\n58,395\n11,321\n59,873\n40,564\n19,528\n30,680\n46,195\n39,202\n30,373\n70,680\n33,372\n65,108\n46,679\n28,034\n63,836\n58,316\n30,698\n64,794\n1,406,87710,873,000\n25,368,000\n17,819,000\n8,705,000\n19,404,000\n9,025,000\n9,812,000\n14,500,000\n9,471,000\n20,875,000\n145,852,0002\n1 Information from the EPA website listed below:  \nwww.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator\n2 Completely carbon-free power generation", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_PENN_2020.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
