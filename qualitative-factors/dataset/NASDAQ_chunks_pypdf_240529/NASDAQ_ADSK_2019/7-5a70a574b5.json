Data for fiscal year 2009 uses a location-\nbased methodology to calculate GHG emissions.\n12.\n These data ar\ne calculated based on the economic input-output lifecycle assessment model, using industry-specific emissions factors in conjunction with Autodesk\u2019s spend.\n13.\n Data f\nor \"capital goods\" were calculated based on annual spend.\n14.\n LEED c\nertifications as of January 31, 2019, include facilities in Beijing, China, Mumbai, India, Tel Aviv, Israel, Milan, Italy, Singapore, Farnborough, United Kingdom, and the following in the United States: San Francisco, \nCalifornia; San Rafael, California; Boston, Massachusetts.\n15.\n Includes w\naste from major conferences and facilities.

Since fiscal year 2009 (our baseline), we have decreased absolute GHG emissions by 41 percent, achieving our goal. \nBusiness travel: We seek to reduce the GHG emissions \nof meeting travel through virtual meetings, partner education, a green rating system for hotels, and by incorporating sustainability expectations into our standard meeting contracts.\n10\nFacilities: We assess our facilities\u2019 environmental operating practices related to energy use and other impact areas and create customized sustainability improvement plans. We also use our operations as test cases to help refine the functionality of our solutions, improve our environmental performance, and showcase how customers can use our solutions to meet their sustainability objectives.\n10\nData centers: In addition to using 100 percent renewable energy for our cloud services, we strive  \nto minimize data center energy use through server virtualization, selection of efficient equipment that meets respected industry standards, and by streamlining our code. These efforts help us provide customers a faster, more reliable experience, with reduced environmental impacts.\n10\nMajor conferences: Since fiscal year 2016, Autodesk University has been carbon neutral, and in fiscal year 2017, we extended this effort to include One Team Conference, our annual channel partner and sales summit. We decrease the climate impact of our conferences and other events by enhancing efficiency, providing virtual attendance options, reducing waste, and purchasing carbon offsets.\n10", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2019.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
