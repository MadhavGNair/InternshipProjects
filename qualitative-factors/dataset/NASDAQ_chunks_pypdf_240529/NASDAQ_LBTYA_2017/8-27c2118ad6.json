Having \ndemonstrated the idea is implementable, scalable and \nbacked by a strong business model, our winner is now \nreceiving additional advice and professional support to \nfurther develop the project.Our inaugural Digital Imagination Challenge, hosted \nby UPC Poland in 2017, was a huge success. With 50 \nhigh-quality entries to review, all from entrepreneurs \ncommitted to making a positive social impact, our judging \npanel had its work cut out.\nThe challenge began with a public online debate, kicked \noff by UPC to discover what the public considered to be \nthe country's most pressings social issues.The hottest \ntopics \u2013 smart living, healthcare monitoring and lifelong \nlearning \u2013 then formed the basis for the challenge and \nthe nation\u2019s top innovators got to work perfecting their \nproposals around these themes.Digital Imagination\nCase studies\nUPC  \nPolandWe are very happy with our victory in the \nDigital Imagination Challenge program.
