To provide outstanding connectivity while running \na responsible, sustainable business, we focus on three \nmain themes.We\u2019re working to ensure that as our business \ngrows, our environmental impact doesn\u2019t grow \nwith it. In 2017, our overall energy efficiency \nimproved by 37% (per terabyte of data traffic \ngenerated). Our electricity consumption \nremained relatively flat, increasing by 1% \ncompared to 2016, and we decreased our total \nmarket-based emissions (scope 1, 2 & 3) by 18%, \nwhich takes into account the GHG intensity of \nthe electricity we source. We also refurbished \n2.2 million set-top boxes and modem units, \navoiding 3,700 metric tons of waste that would \notherwise have ended up in landfill.\nOur global environmental statement sets out \nour commitment to enhancing the energy \nefficiency of our operations, with a focus \non energy use, carbon emissions and the \nmanagement of electronic waste. We\u2019re \ncommitted to achieving a 15% energy efficiency \nimprovement every year through to 2020.To us, empowering people means developing \nthe talents of our employees, investing in an \ninclusive, diverse and engaged workforce, and \ninspiring colleagues to make a difference in the \ncommunities where we operate.\nWe\u2019re committed to driving improvement \naround employee engagement and equality.  \nWe are taking steps to monitor our performance \nand identify opportunities for progress. In 2017, \nfor example, we grew the percentage of women \nin senior management positions by 2% to 26% \nand we also increased the percentage of new \nfemale hires from 19% to 23%. We recognize \nthat we still have plenty of work to do and we\u2019ll \ncontinue to review our policies and processes in \norder to best support our ambition for further \nimprovement.\nAs part of our commitment to helping our \npeople achieve their potential, we invested \nnearly $13 million, achieving over 676,000 \nhours in employee training during 2017. In \naddition, our Step Forward graduate program \nenables graduates to spend two to three years \nrotating through teams, working on a breadth of \nprojects. Last year, 130 graduates participated \nin Step Forward.\nWe also continued to celebrate our employees\u2019 \ndedication to community causes through \nmatched funding and support for over 40 \ncharities, including the Lessons for Life \nFoundation.
