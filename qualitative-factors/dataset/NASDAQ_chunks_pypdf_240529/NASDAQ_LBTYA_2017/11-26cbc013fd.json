{"page_content": "CUSTOMER PRIVACY\nAs a provider of internet, telephone \nand television services, our customers\u2019 \ndigital lives are entrusted to us. So \nevery decision we make comes with an \nobligation to keep personal data safe. \n\u2018Digital safety\u2019 comprises two main \nstrands, customer privacy and data \nsecurity, and because they\u2019re closely \nlinked, our teams work together to \nprotect them. \nIn 2017, we further enhanced our \nthreat monitoring procedures, \nimplementing 20 new processes \nin preparation for the EU\u2019s General \nData Protection Regulation (GDPR), \nwhich became effective in May 2018. \nWe also created a brand new Digital \nConfidence team to step-change the \nway we manage privacy and give \ncustomers control over their data \nwhile growing trust between us.DATA SECURITY\nWe define data security as the \nmeasures that we take to protect \nthe confidentiality and integrity of \nour customers\u2019 data. It\u2019s a priority \nfor us because our customers trust \nus with their data and we work hard \nto maintain that trust. Today, with \nawareness of the importance of data \nsecurity at an all-time high, there is \nincreased demand from customers, \nshareholders and regulators for \nstronger, more secure practices. \nIn 2017, we expanded our Global \nSecurity team and continued to \ninvest in tools and systems across \nour operations. Additionally, we \nstepped up the security training that \nwe provide to staff and continued \nbuilding strong external partnerships \nwith the public and private sector to \nenhance our capabilities.TRUSTED PRODUCTS\nGRI: 418-1In 2017, we strengthened the four-step process we utilize \nin collaboration with suppliers to improve products and \nservices, mitigate risk and identify new opportunities.REQUIREMENTS \nWe updated our Responsible \nProcurement and Supply \nChain Principles to reinforce \nwhat we expect from our \nsuppliers in terms of labor \npractices, forced labor, \ncollective bargaining and \nprivacy and security.We never sell any customer data \nand have strong purpose-limitation \nprocesses in effect. Now we have \ninitiated a new program that backs \nup our determination to do as \nmuch as possible to manage data \ntransparency. As a result, we\u2019ve \nimplemented new systems, put in \nplace changes to protect customer \nrights and help our customers \nunderstand the issues. Our newly \nappointed Data Protection Officer will \noversee this work.\nMaking sure we have visibility of \nprivacy and security across our entire \nsupply chain is key. Last year, we \naudited our third-party management \nprocess to ensure that our vendors \nand suppliers both comply with the \nstandards in our Global Privacy Policy \nand have their own stringent controls \nin place.\nALIGNMENTS \nAll new procurement employees \nnow have access to responsible \ntraining and we incorporate \nresponsible procurement updates \nin our quarterly Procurement \nnewsletter. We\u2019ve continued to \nintegrate Environmental, Social \nand Governance indicators into our \nprocurement processes. Suppliers\u2019 \nEcoVadis assessment scores are \nnow weighted and form part of \nour Procurement Supplier Risk \nAssessment Framework. This allows \nus to monitor and react to high-risk \nsuppliers more effectively.ASSESSMENTS \nIn 2017, we used the EcoVadis \ntool to assess over 230 suppliers. \nSuppliers were selected utilizing \nour own risk-based framework that \nidentifies our highest-risk suppliers \nagainst pressing issues such as \nconflict minerals, modern slavery and \nenvironmental sustainability.DIALOGUE \nWe held ten face-to-face meetings \nwith suppliers in 2017 to discuss \nopportunities for collaboration on \nsupplier improvement. Additionally, \n27 suppliers were asked to improve \ntheir performance through corrective \nactions based on our assessments.\nWe continued using partnerships \nand collaborative platforms, such as \nthe Global e-Sustainability Initiative, \nto make our approach even more \nrobust. We are also working with \nindustry peers to make our supply \nchain more sustainable.Our  \nsupply chain1 2 3 4\n10", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2017.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
