Our Customer \nExperience Operations team has \nlaunched an exciting new project \nto simultaneously strengthen \ncustomer relationships, improve \ncustomer satisfaction and increase \nour operational efficiency.\nBecause we\u2019re committed to \nproviding our customers with \nthe best experience possible, we \nwant them to be able to contact \nus however and whenever they \nchoose. That means making a range \nof more flexible communication \ntools available, starting with a new \nservice for customers to be able to \ncontact us. Rather than waiting for \nan agent to become free, customers \nnow have the opportunity to start \na messaging conversation with \nus. Alongside this, we\u2019re also \nintroducing in-app messaging as a \nkey component of our future apps \nand providing greater management \nof our social media channels.Virgin Media Ireland has taken our \nfirst step.

We\u2019re \nnow getting set to roll out this \nservice across the UK, Germany and \nSwitzerland.\nLooking to the future, we\u2019re \nnow paving the way for the next \ngeneration of messaging services, \nRich Communication Services (RCS). \nRCS combines Facebook Messenger, \nWhatsApp and iMessage into a single \nplatform and is designed to work with \nall software and smart phones.\u201cWe understand that the lives of our \ncustomers are fluid and demanding,\u201d  \nsays Melanie Longdon, VP of \nCustomer Experience Operations.  \n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have time to wait \nfor answers to our questions \u2013 that\u2019s \nwhy we\u2019re messaging each other \nmore than ever in our personal lives. \nKnowing this, we\u2019re using market-\nleading technology to ensure that \nour customer support goes fully \ndigital and aligns with consumers, \nempowering them to use our services \non their own terms and at their own \npace, for a best-in-class experience.\u201dCUSTOMER EXPERIENCE / SERVICE QUALITY\n11", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2017.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
