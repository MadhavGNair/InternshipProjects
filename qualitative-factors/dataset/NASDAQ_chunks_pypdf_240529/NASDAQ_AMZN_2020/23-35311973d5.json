We are working to launch Shipment Zero deliveries in Europe and \nthe U.S., followed by India, Japan, and all other geographies where we operate across the globe.\nThe emissions sources considered in scope for Shipment Zero are:  \n 1. Electricity emissions from powering operations facilities and vehicle charging;\n 2. Transportation tailpipe emissions from the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles that transport shipments  \n  from inventory to the customer;\n 3. Emissions from manufacturing and transporting the materials used in outbound packaging.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2020.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
