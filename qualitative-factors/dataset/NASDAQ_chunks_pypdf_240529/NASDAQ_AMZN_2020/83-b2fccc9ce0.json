We were also able to support the Nest\u2019s PPE Purchasing initiative\u2014 a program that purchased over \n  200,000 protective masks to be delivered to front-line workers. This program distributed over $500,000 in   \n  economic relief value to 57 businesses, which altogether employed 10,510 skilled artisans. \n \u2022 We are supporting the Amader Kotha Helpline, which provides workers with a grievance mechanism to   \n  report and resolve factory concerns in the ready-made garment sector. Our contribution will help support the   \n  organization\u2019s increased call volumes and the 24/7 factory grievance lines in regions impacted by COVID-19. The  \n  Helpline serves as a resource for 600+ factories, 30 of which are Amazon suppliers, reaching 1.5 million workers   \n  in Bangladesh, and supporting them in safely transitioning back into the workplace.\n \u2022 In India, we partnered with Swasti\u2014a global nonprofit committed to ensuring access to quality healthcare for   \n  workers and those in marginalized communities\u2014 to adapt their worker well-being program (Invest4Wellness) to   \n  provide support to workers in factories impacted by COVID-19. With our support, Swasti is setting up a worker   \n  helpline, developing health protocols for workers to return to work safely, establishing an emergency response   \n  team, and providing critical mental health, healthcare, and social entitlement support to workers, their families, and  \n  their communities. These services are available to seven factories in our supply chain, reaching 3,500 workers\u2014  \n  including 1,400 women\u2014and their families. \nLearn more about how we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic on our Day One blog.COVID-19  \n ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2020.pdf", "page": 83, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
