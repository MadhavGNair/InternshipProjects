All rights \nreserved.\u201cOur results show that AWS\u2019s infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient \nthan the median of the surveyed U.S. enterprise data centers. More than two-\nthirds of this advantage is attributable to the combination of a more energy \nefficient server population and much higher server utilization. AWS data centers \nare also more energy efficient than enterprise sites due to comprehensive \nefficiency programs that touch every facet of the facility. When we factor in the \ncarbon intensity of consumed electricity and renewable energy purchases, \nwhich reduce associated carbon emissions, AWS performs the same task with \nan 88% lower carbon footprint.\u201d  amzn.to/cloud-efficiency", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2020.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
