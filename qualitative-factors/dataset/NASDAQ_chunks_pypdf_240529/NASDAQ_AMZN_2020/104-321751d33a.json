In 2020, we announced that we are adding more than 1,800 electric vehicles from \nMercedes-Benz Vans to our delivery fleet in Europe. In addition to our investments in vehicle \nelectrification, we are maximizing efficiency on current vehicles, optimizing our delivery logistics, and \nusing alternative delivery methods. See Sustainable Transportation.\nSince 2015, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% and eliminated over \n900,000 tons of packaging material, the equivalent of approximately 1.6 billion shipping boxes. In \n2019, we launched a fully recyclable paper padded mailer that protects products during shipping \nwhile taking up less space in transit. In June 2020, Amazon India announced that it eliminated 100% \nof single-use plastic in packaging across fulfillment centers. See Reducing Packaging Waste.\nWe are making these significant investments to drive our carbon footprint to zero despite the fact \nthat shopping online is already inherently more carbon efficient than going to the store. Amazon\u2019s \nsustainability scientists have found that, averaged across all basket sizes, online grocery deliveries \ngenerate 43% lower carbon emissions per item compared to shopping in stores. Smaller basket sizes \ngenerate even greater carbon savings.
