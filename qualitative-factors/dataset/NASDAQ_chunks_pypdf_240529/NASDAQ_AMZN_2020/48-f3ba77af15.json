{"page_content": "AMAZON SUSTAINABILITY    ENVIRONMENT49On-Site Water Treatment \nAWS is implementing on-site modular water treatment systems in multiple regions. As water is cycled through \nevaporative cooling units, minerals build up as water evaporates, eventually reaching a level of concentration that \nrequires replacement with fresh water. On-site water treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse \nwater for more cycles. Increasing our \u201ccycles of concentration\u201d allows us to continue to reduce water intake for cooling \nour data centers.\nWater Efficiency Metrics \nIn the infrastructure regions where we use water for cooling, AWS has developed water efficiency metrics to determine \nand monitor optimal water use for each AWS Region, and we employ a data-driven approach to select the most \neffective water reduction technologies. Water metrics from each of our Regions help AWS evaluate technologies and \nunderstand the long-term impacts on our water usage, in order to increase efficiency as our infrastructure grows and we \nexpand to new regions.\nWe are partnering with utilities to connect directly to utility water meters, and we are also installing our own meters \nto track real-time water usage to provide consistent data for our operations and sustainability teams. By analyzing this \ndata, AWS can identify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly make operational changes, rather than waiting \nfor bills or usage reports.\nAWS will continue to implement these strategies and test new technologies in order to reduce our water consumption \nand conserve potable water sources. Saving water is good for the environment and also benefits our customers as we \nincrease our operational efficiency.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2020.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
