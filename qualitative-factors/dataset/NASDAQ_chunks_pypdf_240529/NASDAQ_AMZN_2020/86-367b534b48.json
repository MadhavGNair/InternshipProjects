The AWS Disaster Response Action Team (DRT) allows customers to focus on mission- \n critical functions, while AWS provisions critical data and applications, transports hardware to the base of operations, and  \n implements deployable infrastructure based on customer need. For example, in 2019, in the wake of Hurricane Dorian (a  \n Category 5 storm that struck the Bahamas), the DRT helped set up connectivity and communications networks at more than  \n 40 medical facilities and shelters in the country. In 2019, AWS also launched AWS Project Resilience, offering up to $2,000  \n in  AWS credits to state and local governments, community organizations, and educational institutions to better prepare for  \n natural and man-made disasters.
