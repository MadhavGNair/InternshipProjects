{"page_content": "108 AMAZON SUSTAINABILITY    GOVERNANCEClimate-Related Risks:\nWe have identified the following climate-related risks based on TCFD risk types and classifications. Physical risks are classified as either: 1) Acute (extreme weather events) or 2) \nChronic (changing weather patterns and rising mean temperature and sea levels). Transition risks are classified as one or more of the following: 1) Policy and Legal; 2) Technology; \n3) Market; and/or 4) Reputation.  \nRisk Type Description Classification\nPhysical Increasing risk of flood or damages due to climate-related events could increase our physical and operational risks and the \ncost to insure our buildings. Repeated damage due to flooding could result in an inability to insure existing buildings.Acute\nPhysical Weather-related events such as hurricanes could cause asset damage to our buildings, prevent deliveries to customers, and \nnegatively impact sales. Acute\nPhysical Extreme and prolonged weather events such as droughts could impact water availability for data center operations. Acute\nPhysical Weather-related events could impact our ability to access raw materials and deliver final products. Acute\nPhysical A warming climate could increase thermal stress and outdoor associate exposure to criteria air pollutants.  \nThese stresses could negatively impact the health of our employees, close sites, and delay customer deliveries.Chronic\nPhysical As temperatures increase and water availability decreases, we could experience rising costs for data center cooling. Chronic\nTransition Increasing regulations and evolving public preference may require a faster transition to a low-carbon economy, which could \nincrease operating costs and/or reduce demands for some products and services.Policy and Legal;  \nMarket; Reputation", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2020.pdf", "page": 107, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
