For example, a group of researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird   \n  Conservancy published some exciting understandings about bird migration patterns based on NOAA\u2019s NEXRAD   \n  weather data that is freely available on AWS.\nASDI supports innovators and researchers with the data, tools, and technical expertise they need to move sustainability \nto the next level.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2020.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
