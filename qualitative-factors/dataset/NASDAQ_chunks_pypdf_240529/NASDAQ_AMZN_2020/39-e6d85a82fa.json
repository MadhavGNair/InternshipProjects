{"page_content": "AMAZON SUSTAINABILITY    ENVIRONMENT40Palm Oil \nPalm oil is used extensively as an ingredient in consumer products. However, its cultivation has contributed to deforestation, \nbiodiversity loss, and negative social impacts in some of the regions where it is grown. Our approach is to promote the use of \nsustainably-certified palm oil in our Private Brand food products and ask our Private Brand suppliers to source palm oil that is \nsustainably-certified. We are starting with Amazon-owned Private Brand food products in North America and across Europe, \nwhere our goal is to source 100% sustainable palm oil by the end of 2020.\nChemicals\nWe are committed to developing high-quality and affordable Amazon-owned Private Brand products that \ncustomers love. Part of our commitment to quality is avoiding chemicals of concern in our products that can \naffect human health and/or the environment. We define chemicals of concern as those chemicals that: (1) meet \nthe criteria for classification as a carcinogen, mutagen, or reproductive or other systemic toxicant; or (2) are \npersistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. We strategically prioritize which chemicals of concern to focus on based on \nproduct type, customer concerns, and the availability of safer alternatives.\nThe baseline list of chemicals of concern included on our first Restricted Substance List (RSL) identifies the chemicals \nthat we seek to avoid in Amazon-owned Private Brand baby, household cleaning, personal care, and beauty products \nin the U.S. and Europe. This policy is in addition to applicable local legal requirements and associated compliance \nplans. It will be expanded to additional brands, product categories, and geographies over time.
