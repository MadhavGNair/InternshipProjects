Scientists at The Nature Conservancy have identified this \nnetwork of climate-resilient forests as most able to thrive in the face of climate change. \nAmazon, The Nature Conservancy, the American Forest Foundation, and the \nVermont Land Trust are partnering on two innovative projects\u2014the Family Forest \nCarbon Program and Forest Carbon Co-ops. \nThe Family Forest Carbon Program will open up carbon credit markets to small \nfamily forest owners for the first time. Amazon\u2019s commitment will expand the \nprogram in the Appalachians and other U.S. regions and go towards designing new methods \nfor measuring and verifying reforestation and forest management practices. The Forest Carbon Co-op will help \nowners of mid-sized forests use sustainable forest management and protection measures to earn income through the Right Now Climate Fund\nAmazon established the Right Now Climate Fund, a $100 million fund to restore \nand conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Through the \nRight Now Climate Fund, we are taking immediate action to remove or avoid \ncarbon emissions by supporting nature-based climate solutions.  \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2020.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
