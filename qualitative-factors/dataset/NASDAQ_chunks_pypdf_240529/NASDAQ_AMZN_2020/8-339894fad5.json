In 2019, we reached 42% \nrenewable energy across our business. As of December 2020, Amazon has 127 solar and wind projects across the \nglobe that have the capacity to generate over 6,500 megawatts and deliver more than 18 million megawatt hours of \nenergy annually\u2014enough to power more than 1.7 million U.S. homes.\n \nShipment Zero  \nShipment Zero is Amazon\u2019s vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with a goal of delivering 50% of \nshipments with net zero carbon by 2030. Shipment Zero means that the fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver \na customer\u2019s shipment are net zero carbon\u2014from the fulfillment center where an item is picked off the shelf, to the \nmaterials used to package the item, and the mode of transportation that gets the package to the customer\u2019s door.\n \nElectric Vehicles  \nIn 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 new electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, a U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer. This \norder, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and de-\nveloping new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon plans to \nhave 10,000 of the new electric vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030.  \nSustainable Packaging  \nAmazon created our Frustration-Free Packaging program to encourage manufacturers to package their products \nin easy-to-open, 100% recyclable packaging that is ready to ship to customers without the need for an additional \nshipping box. Since 2015, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by 33% and eliminated more than \n900,000 tons of packaging material, the equivalent of 1.6 billion shipping boxes.\n \nRight Now Climate Fund  \nAmazon established the Right Now Climate Fund, a $100 million fund to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and \ngrasslands around the world. Through the Right Now Climate Fund, Amazon is taking immediate action to remove or \navoid carbon emissions by supporting nature-based climate solutions. Amazon is working with The Nature Conser-\nvancy to identify projects around the world that can create real and lasting carbon reductions, while also empower-\ning communities, enhancing natural environments, and protecting wildlife.\nClimate Pledge Fund  \nIn June 2020, Amazon announced The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of sustainable and \ndecarbonizing technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet the goals set \nby The Climate Pledge. This dedicated investment program\u2014with an initial $2 billion in funding\u2014will invest in \nvisionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low carbon economy.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2020.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
