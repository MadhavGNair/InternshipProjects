{"page_content": "OUR SHAREHOLDERS \nAEGON\u2019S HIGH QUALITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO \nWorld \ufb01nancial markets came under considerable pressure in 2007. Initially, this pressure stemmed from \nproblems in the US housing market and so-called \u2018subprime\u2019 mortgages. By the end of the year, concerns \nhad spread to credit markets around the world. \nAEGON has taken a number of measures designed to maintain its strong \ufb01 nancial position, despite\n \ndif\ufb01cult market conditions.\n AEGON \ufb01rst became concerned about the direction of the US subprime market in 2002.\n \nSince then the company has switched more money into safer, higher quality subprime investments.\n \nToday, 99% of AEGON USA\u2019s subprime investments are rated either \u2018AAA\u2019 or \u2018AA\u2019.\n \nIn addition, the Group has also taken further steps to reduce its exposure to equity markets in both\n \nthe Americas and the Netherlands.\n Despite dif\ufb01 cult market conditions, AEGON has proposed a 13% increase in full-year dividends for\n \nshareholders and has maintained its very high credit rating with international rating agencies such\n \nas Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s.\n \n\u201cIn 2007, AEGON maintained its strong \ufb01 nancial position despite considerable turbulence in world \n\ufb01nancial markets. We suffered no material impairments during the year, a testimony to the Group\u2019s robust \nand effective approach to managing risk.\u201d  \u2013 Don Shepard, Chairman of AEGON\u2019s Executive Board. \nAEGON faces a number of different types of risk. These \ninclude: \nMovements in \ufb01 nancial markets and the credit strength \nof investments; \nMovements in interest and currency exchange rates; \nChanges in longevity, mortality or morbidity trends; \nLawsuits, fraud, changes in tax rates, business and \nother strategic risks.\n Clearly, the amount of risk an insurance company is willing to take on \u2013 and the nature of that risk \u2013 has a profound impact on its corporate strategy. Risk management helps determine the way an insurance company designs its products and services, the way it prices insured risks, the way it allocates available capital, and even its approach to mergers and acquisitions. \nAs a company with businesses in more than twenty \ncountries around the world, AEGON\u2019s approach to risk \nmanagement is an integrated one, combining local knowledge with clearly defined principles and policies established at Group level. \n22 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2007.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
