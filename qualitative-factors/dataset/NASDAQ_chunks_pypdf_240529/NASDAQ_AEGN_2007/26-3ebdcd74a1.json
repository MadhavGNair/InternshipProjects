{"page_content": "Chapter three OUR SHAREHOLDERS \nThis approach: \nAllows country units to share best practice; \nEnsures a closer alignment between risk management \nand AEGON\u2019s underlying businesses. \nIn recent years, AEGON has been setting up new governance structures, both at Group level and within its country units, to ensure the effectiveness of an integrated, Group-wide risk management strategy. \nAEGON has put in place a series of local and international \nrisk and capital committees. Through these committees, AEGON\u2019s local operations play a central role in identifying and measuring risk. Thanks to AEGON\u2019s integrated approach, they are also able to use more coordinated, Group-wide strategies to handle that risk more effectively. Today, AEGON has approximately twenty senior risk managers in The Hague, Dublin and the United States, responsible for overseeing risk management for AEGON\u2019s businesses around the world. \nAEGON has recently announced a number of measures \ndesigned to further strengthen the Group\u2019s risk management. \nAs part of these measures: \nA dedicated risk committee will be created, made up of \nmembers of AEGON\u2019s Supervisory Board; \nThe Management Board will increase its involvement in risk management; \nAEGON\u2019s two corporate risk departments \u2013 US Corporate \nRisk and Group Risk \u2013 will be brought together to form a single Group Risk function, providing support and risk supervision to individual operating units. Under this set-up, the existing US Corporate/Group Risk team will continue to support US management; \nRegional Chief Risk Of\ufb01 cers will be appointed to\n \nfacilitate Group-wide risk management initiatives.\n The next few years will bring significant changes to the way in which Europe\u2019s insurance companies manage their finances: \nThe European Union Commission is planning the \ufb01  rst \nmajor overhaul of EU capital adequacy guidelines in 30 years; \nThe method commonly used to calculate embedded value \u2013 probably the most important measure of an insurance company\u2019s underlying worth \u2013 is also being rede\ufb01  ned; \nUnder IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), \nmany accounting rules have already changed and further \nchanges are planned. \nAEGON is planning to incorporate these changes into its \u2018Economic Framework\u2019 \u2013 a new internal model for risk and capital management that the Group intends to introduce in 2008. The \u2018Economic Capital Model\u2019 will help more closely align AEGON\u2019s financial management with its underlying businesses. Having an efficient, working \ninternal model is a necessary precondition for AEGON to switch to \u2018Group Supervision\u2019 under proposed new EU solvency requirements \u2013 a step that is expected to reward the Group\u2019s sound and efficient risk management and, ultimately, reduce the amount of capital AEGON needs to hold and free more money for other projects. \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nAEGON is a public company under Dutch law. It is governed by three corporate bodies: \nGeneral Meeting of Shareholders\n Executive Board\n Supervisory Board \nThe Executive Board is charged with the management of the company.
