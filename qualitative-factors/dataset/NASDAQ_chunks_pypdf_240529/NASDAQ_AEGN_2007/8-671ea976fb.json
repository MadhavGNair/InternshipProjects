This 2007 report \u2013 AEGON\u2019s fifth to date \u2013 sets out some of the policies and specific initiatives we are currently pursuing to ensure that we continue to meet our larger responsibilities in the years ahead. As we continue to expand our busin esses, we r emain committed to our \nfundamental values of Respect, Quality, Transparency and Trust. \nAEGON\u2019s core business is to provide long-term financial \nprotection. When we sell a life insurance policy or a pension, we recognize that we are making a long-term promise to that customer. Clearly, that person must have the confidence that AEGON will be there to honor that promise whenever the time comes. In this regard, AEGON\u2019s success will ultimately be measured not only by how many policies we sell, but also by our ability to fulfill the many promises we make each and every day. \nI hope that AEGON\u2019s 2007 corporate responsibility helps \nto provide a better understanding of the steps we are taking to safeguard the trust and confidence of our many stakeholders around the world. \nRETIREMENT \nIn April this year, I will be retiring as chairman of AEGON\u2019s Executive Board after a career that began with our US company Life Investors thirty-eight years ago.

This applies as \nmuch to our corporate responsibility policies as it \ndoes to our overall business strategy. Through the \nfinancial products we offer, the jobs we provide, and selection of my su ccessor, Alexander Wynaendts, a member \nof AEGON N.V.\u2019s Executive Board and currently the Chief Operating Officer. These past several years, I have worked closely with Alex and have always been impr essed by his \nstrong commitment to responsible business practice, as well as his keen understanding of the challenges of operating in diverse international markets. His broad experience and international outlook will be of enormous benefit to AEGON in the coming years. I have enjoyed working with Alex and our other Executive Board colleague Jos Streppel, as well as members of the Group\u2019s Management Board, to improve AEGON\u2019s financial position, strengthen our exis ting businesses and expand \ninternationally where we believe we can achieve long-term growth and provide lasting value.
