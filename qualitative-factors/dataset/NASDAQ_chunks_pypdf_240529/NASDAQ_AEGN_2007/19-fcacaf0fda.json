{"page_content": "OUR CUSTOMERS \nSPONSORING DUTCH SOCCER \nLast year AEGON signed an agreement to sponsor Dutch football club Ajax from the start of the 2008-09 season. As part of this sponsorship deal, the AEGON name will appear on Ajax\u2019s famous red-and-white jerseys when the new season kicks off next August. Sponsoring the Amsterdam-based club will help strengthen AEGON\u2019s brand recognition, especially as the Group continues to expand its international presence in the years ahead. \nOne of the best-known names in world soccer, Ajax has won 29 national league titles and lifted the \nprestigious European Cup no fewer than four times \u2013 a record bettered by only three other clubs, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Liverpool. Ajax\u2019s success, both at home and abroad, has been based for many years on the club\u2019s famous Youth Academy, which has groomed several generations of Dutch footballers for glittering international careers, including perhaps the best known Dutch soccer star ever, Johan Cruyff. The Ajax sponsorship deal will operate alongside AEGON\u2019s other sporting commitments \u2013 to speed-skating and rowing in the Netherlands and to golfers Zach Johnson and Taylor Leon in the United States and Lloyd Saltman in the United Kingdom. \nFINANCIAL LITERACY \nAEGON plays a role in ensuring its customers have the information they need to make the right long-term financial decisions for themselves and their families.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM: \nAEGON is backing the UK government\u2019s National Strategy for Financial Capability to improve levels of \ufb01 nancial education; \nAEGON UK supports pfeg, an educational charity \nproviding school leavers with basic \ufb01  nancial skills;\n \nAEGON UK has also provided backing for \u2018Moneyplan\u2019, a partnership between national charity Citizens Advice and the Personal Finance Society. \u2018Moneyplan\u2019 is aimed at providing free-of-charge advice to those who turn to the charity to help resolve their money problems. \nIn addition, AEGON country units in Europe, the Americas and Asia organize regular s eminars and training sessions \nfor salesmen, intermediaries and brokers to improve the quality of financial advice they are able to give potential customers. \nDISTRIBUTION \nAEGON uses a number of commercial channels to distribute its products, including agents, brokers, banks, direct marketing, as well as partnerships with other companies.
