{"page_content": "Chapter two OUR CUSTOMERS \n\u2018MONEY GUIDANCE\u2019 IN THE UNITED KINGDOM \nIn 2007, the UK government asked Otto Thoresen, Chief Executive Of\ufb01 cer of AEGON UK, to chair a task \nforce looking into providing impartial and easy-to-understand \ufb01 nancial advice, especially to those on the \nlowest incomes. The initiative was part of broader efforts to strengthen \ufb01nancial education in the United \nKingdom, important at a time of rising household debt and growing economic uncertainty. In March 2008, \nMr. Thoresen \u2018s task force published its report, recommending the creation of a national Money Guidance \nservice, funded jointly by the UK government and the country\u2019s \ufb01nancial sector. The proposal has already \nbeen given the backing of the UK government and will now be taken up by the country\u2019s Financial Services \nAuthority. The new service would provide free, impartial advice to as many as 19 million potential users. \n\u201cThis is not a service designed for those in crisis,\u201d said Mr. Thoresen. \u201cIt must be preventative, helping \npeople budget and plan for today and the future. Good money sense needs to be as much part of people\u2019s \nlives as healthy eating and keeping \ufb01  t.\u201d \nONLINE SERVICES \nProviding financial services online can help reduce transaction costs and cut down on the need for business travel and printed materials. Most AEGON country and business units provide online services of one sort or another. These services include: \nInformation on \ufb01  nancial products; \nOnline application forms; \nModifying personal data; \nModifying premium contributions;\n Accessing quotes; \nOnline calculation tools. Most AEGON companies operate IT fraud detection systems and all units use feedback loops to compliance officers to ensure the Group\u2019s online platforms remain safe and secure at all times. Approximately 5.7 million people visited AEGON websites outside the United States during 2007\n1. In addition, the Group\u2019s US-based websites received \nsome 93 million separate \u2018hits\u2019 over the year. More than 50% of visitors requesting information online went on to buy a financial product or service from the company (or, just over 18,200 in total, a small but growing part of the Group\u2019s overall customer base). \nSUPPORTING THE DUISENBURG SCHOOL OF FINANCE \nAEGON has committed EUR 500,000 a year over the next \ufb01ve years to help support the new Duisenburg School of Finance in Amsterdam. Named after former European Central Bank president Wim Duisenburg, the School will act as an academy, training future generations of business leaders and \ufb01  nanciers. \nThe School of Finance\u2019s board will be chaired by Jos Streppel\n 2, AEGON\u2019s Chief Financial Of\ufb01  cer and \nmember of the Executive Board. \n1 \tRefers to the number of \u2018unique visitors\u2019, i.e. the total number of Internet users visiting the site or sites during 2007.
