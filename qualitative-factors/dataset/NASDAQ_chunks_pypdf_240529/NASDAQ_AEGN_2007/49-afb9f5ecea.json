{"page_content": "CONCLUSION\n \nOver recent years, corporate responsibility has grown in \nimportance. Doing business around the world is no longer simply about making profits, it is also about ensuring long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability. \nAs one of the world\u2019s leading providers of life insurance \nand pensions, AEGON recognizes that creating a sustainable business means acting in the long-term interests not only of its shareholders and customers, but also its employees and business partners as well as the broader communities in which the Group operates. In the years to come, as populations age and governments shift more of the responsibility for pension funding to the private sector, financial services companies like AEGON will play an increasingly important social role. \nAEGON believes it has a contribution to make as a \nresponsible employer and investor, and as a provider of the kind of long-term financial products and services that people around the world will need to help build better futures for themselves and their families. \n46 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2007.pdf", "page": 49, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
