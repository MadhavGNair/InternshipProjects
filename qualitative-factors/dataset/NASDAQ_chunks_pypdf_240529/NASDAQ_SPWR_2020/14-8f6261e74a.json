With the spin-off of Maxeon Solar Technologies in August of 2020, \nour sustainability focus shifts to our downstream business of sales, storage \ninnovation and energy services. The following emissions information reflects \nour operations footprint which includes our Oregon manufacturing facility1 \nand excludes Maxeon Technologies\u2019 manufacturing sites.\nType of Emissions  \nMetric Ton (MT) CO2e in 000s2019 2020\nGHG Scope 1 2.61 0.42\nGHG Scope 2 10.06 8.37\nGHG Scope 3 16.67 13.15\nTotal Emissions from Operations 29.33 21.94Scope 2 Emissions\nElectricity and gas consumptions \nfrom our major offices and our \nOregon manufacturing facility.\nIn 2019, SunPower began to reduce \nits North American freight carbon \nfootprint through strategic logistics \nchanges, including optimized \nnetwork movements and expanded \nuse of intermodal shipments using \ntrains rather than truckloads. These \nrefinements enabled the company \nto reduce the miles per shipment \nand per pound, reducing emissions \nsystem-wide.
