These solutions led to production changes and employee training programs that have resulted in measurable results. \nToday we are recycling or reusing the bulk of our \nmanufacturing waste. From 2010 to 2014, we were able to reduce net waste by 57 percent per tonne \u2013 far exceeding our 15 percent goal. \nWhere possible surplus materials are recycled and \nreused in our manufacturing facilities worldwide. And we went even further, by finding ways to harvest and transform into energy the materials that are not recycled or reused. All these efforts speak for themselves. As of 2014, 67 of our facilities send Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWTL) and 48 percent of our production was from ZWTL sites.\nTransforming Into a Zero Landfilled Waste Facility: Piracicaba\nPiracicaba, one of Mondel\u0113z International\u2019s largest plants in Brazil, produced large amounts of landfill waste each year. This included food containers, ingredient packages, plastic cups and other non-recyclable waste material. The on-site team challenged itself to cut to ZWTL by the end of 2014. The team implemented a multi-faceted plan to recycle and co-process waste as well as turn broken and rejected material into compost and animal feed. The plant successfully achieved the ZWTL goal by November 2014.\nReduced net \nwaste by\nnearly \n4x over \ngoal57%\n*graph reflects goal of 60%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MDLZ_2014.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
