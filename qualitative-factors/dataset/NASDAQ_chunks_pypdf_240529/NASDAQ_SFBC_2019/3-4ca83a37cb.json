I started with Sound Community Bank thirteen years ago, managing a lending team.  Currently, I am the Chief Banking Officer.  Community is a vital part of our DNA at Sound Community Bank.  We always seek to leave our communities better than we found them \u2013 be that through innovative products on the loan and deposit side, financial literacy, banking underserved communities, or through the volunteerism \nof our employees.  I am very proud to work for an organization that thinks and acts locally. We began our banking relationship with Sound Community Bank in October 2019 \nafter an exhausting quest for a lender to refinance a rental property.  The loan officer \nwas supportive and patient, helping us navigate the online process (which was \nchallenging to us as baby boomers in our seventies).   Consequently, our experience \nfrom beginning to end was so positive and professional that we moved all our \ninvestment banking to Sound Community Bank, and just recently closed on a \nsecond refinance on another investment property.  We feel blessed by the welcoming \nand supportive services we receive from the staff and look forward to continuing our \nrelationship with the Bank. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SFBC_2019.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
