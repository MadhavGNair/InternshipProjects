A temporary treatment system was \ninstalled to treat wastewater prior to discharge to the local public treatment plant, eliminating the need to collect and ship the wastewater off-site for \ndisposal. A long-term system is expected to be completed in 2014.\nThe company has several recycling programs for construction materials, \ncopper piping, wood and batteries.
