In order  \nto present a more comprehensive account  \nof the company\u2019s environmental footprint,  \nthe 2013 metrics in the tables include 650,000 square feet of leased office space not captured in previous reports (along with adjusted \namounts to facilitate comparisons to prior years).\nTo accurately capture and track the company\u2019s \nenvironmental impact, we use a specialized \nsoftware solution known as an Energy and \nSustainability System of Record (ESS). The ESS \nenables us to collect, analyze, interpret, act \non and report power and water consumption, \nwaste generation, business travel data and \ngreenhouse gas (G hG) emissions (Scope 1, 2 \nand 3 under the \u201cGreenhouse Gas Protocol\u201d\n1), \nwith consistent units and correlation to global  \nreporting standards.
