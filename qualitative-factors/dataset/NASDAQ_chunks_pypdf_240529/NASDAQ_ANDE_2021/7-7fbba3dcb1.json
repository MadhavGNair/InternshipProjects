Intuitively, we believe the \nmajority of our upstream Scope 3 \nemissions will come from our farmer \nsuppliers, as is generally the case for \nothers in our industry. This is an emission \nsource best estimated by proxy and will \ntake some time to refine as we partner \nwith our suppliers and others. We hope \nto include more information in the future \nas we continue to evaluate our impact \nin order to determine the best path \nforward. We intend to provide solutions \nto our customers through product \ninnovation and to continue to work with \nour trusted farmer suppliers to bring \nabout a better future for all.CO 2 EMISSIONS (GHG)\nSCOPE 3 GHG EMISSIONS SCOPE 1 SCOPE 2 SCOPE 3 \nFuel Use Electricity Use Upstream & Downstream\nManufacturing \nProcessingPurchased \nElectricityCorporate Travel\nFarmer \nSuppliersMerchandising \n& TradingANDE \nProducts\nTBD TBD ~260 \nmtsCO2eq\nTBD~150,000 \nmtsCO2eq~700,000 \nmtsCO2eq", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2021.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
