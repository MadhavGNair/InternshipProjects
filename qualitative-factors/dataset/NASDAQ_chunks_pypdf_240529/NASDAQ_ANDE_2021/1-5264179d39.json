It was exciting to share it as part of an ongoing dialogue \nwith our customers and key partners in the ag supply chain. The \npublication successfully communicated the actions we are taking \non a wide variety of issues and how we are participating in the \nimportant conversation on sustainability.\nAs you know, the first step to manage something is to measure \nit. I am proud to say that we have made significant progress \nmeasuring our greenhouse gases and are now able to report \nour results. The following Sustainability Review is not a year-\nend company narrative. It is intended as an abbreviated update \nfocusing on the environmental metrics on which we have been \nworking on in 2021. Please refer to our 2020 Sustainability Review \nfor a broader discussion of our sustainability activities.\nStay tuned for Earth Day 2022 when The Andersons will publish \nits next review. Humble beginnings for sure, but from humble \nbeginnings come great things.
