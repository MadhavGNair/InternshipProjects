In 2021, we \nconcentrated on our impact to the environment as an element of our \nrole in a sustainable future. This report focuses on our greenhouse gas \n(GHG) impact. We intend to continue to track and report our metrics as \npart of our contribution to a sustainable future. As a first step, this year, \nwe participated in the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transformation \n(Supplier LoCT) process to establish our baseline GHG impact. Moving \nforward, we expect our annual ES&G disclosure to include items like \nenvironmental impact improvements, trends, projects, and partnerships, \nas well as our social and governance data and information.\nWe believe that a better understanding of our environmental impact \nwill lead to opportunities to produce and promote more sustainable \nproducts and prepare us for what everyone expects to be an exciting \nfuture for sustainable agriculture.\nThe Andersons has a long tradition of improvement and innovation.  \nBy integrating sustainability programs into our operations and supply \nchain reach, we are furthering that practice. We look forward to \ncreating a new level of collaboration with our employees, customers, \nfarmer producers, and the communities where we live and work.A LETTER FROM ES&G DIRECTOR TIMOTHY VENVERLOH\nTimothy Venverloh\nDirector, Environmental, Social, and Governance\nThe Andersons", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2021.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
