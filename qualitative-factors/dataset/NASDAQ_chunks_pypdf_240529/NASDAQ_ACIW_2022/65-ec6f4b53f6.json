The board and the Executive \nLeadership Team annually review the TPRM Policy to ensure consistency with \nother company procedures and standards.\nThe TPRM Policy establishes a risk-based framework for managing supplier \nrisk at ACI based on the criticality tier of service(s) provided by a vendor. The \npolicy details required risk management activities throughout the supplier \nengagement lifecycle, from planning, due diligence and contracting phases to \nongoing monitoring and termination of a vendor relationship. \nDuring the planning and due diligence processes, we conduct thorough \nresearch of a prospective supplier and evaluate the benefits and risks of \nengagement.

In supplier contracts, \nwe have clauses related to compliance with laws, adherence to \nethical business conduct and respect for human rights, including \nanti-corruption, anti-slavery and anti-human trafficking. Through \nthe inclusion of regulatory compliance and sustainable business \nrequirements in procurement agreements, we have been able \nto certify that 100% of our suppliers warrant having policies \nin place and adhering to laws and expectations in regard to \nlegal, responsible and ethical business practices. \nThe level and frequency of ongoing supplier monitoring \nand tasks involved to address any potential gaps or \nissues are determined based on the inherent risk of \nsuppliers. Vendors are assessed periodically on \nvarious aspects, including contract performance, \nengagement criticality and control procedures.
