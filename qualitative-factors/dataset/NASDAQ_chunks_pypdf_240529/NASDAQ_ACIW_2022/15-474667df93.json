The assessment concluded in \nearly 2022, consolidating insights from interviews and a survey with key ACI internal \nand external stakeholders, along with competitive benchmarking and industry \ntrends. Stakeholders who participated included members of our Board of Directors, \nour Executive Leadership Team, investors, employees, customers and business \npartners. \nWe used the assessment to determine our stakeholders\u2019 perspectives on the \nimportance of 24 ESG topics that are relevant to ACI\u2019s business. Topics were \nidentified through industry research, peer insights and sustainability framework \nalignment (e.g., Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) guidelines, \nGlobal Reporting Initiatives (GRI) standards). \nThe following matrix illustrates how our internal versus external stakeholders \nprioritized the 24 ESG topics. These insights will be used throughout the strategy \ndevelopment process, along with additional industry and internal analysis, to help us \nidentify a subset of ESG priorities to pursue over the next few years.
