T o accomplish this goal, ACI has adopted the ISO \n27001/27002 and the NIST cybersecurity frameworks as the \nfoundations for security controls.\nWe utilize SIEM technology that supports security risk \ndetection and incident response through real-time data \ncollection and historical analysis of security events. We \ndefine a GIS risk as a finding that has the potential to cause \ndamage or loss to ACI. Identified risks are reviewed by GIS \nleadership, discussed with stakeholders and assigned to a \ndesignated owner from the appropriate business unit. An \nappointed owner is required to develop a risk mitigation plan \nby incorporating a criticality ranking, recommendations and \nrequirements provided by the GIS team and provide weekly \nupdates to GIS leadership.
