INHERENT LIMITATIONS\nThe absence of a significant body of \nestablished practice on which to draw \nto evaluate and measure non-financial \ninformation allows for different, but \nacceptable, evaluation and measurement \ntechniques that can affect comparability \nbetween entities and over time.\nNon-financial performance information \nis subject to more inherent limitations \nthan financial information, given the \ncharacteristics of the underlying subject \nmatter and the methods used for \ndetermining such information. The \nprecision of different measurement \ntechniques may also vary.SUBJECT MATTER INFORMATION AND REPORTING CRITERIA\nThe Subject Matter Information needs to be read and understood together with the \nReporting Criteria available at wpp.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2021/wpp-\nsustainability-reporting-criteria-20211, which WPP is solely responsible for selecting and \napplying.
