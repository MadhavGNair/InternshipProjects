The pilot program \npaired 180 participants, matched based on \ntheir professional profiles, program goals, \nskills, and interest across multiple business \nunits and job families. Throughout the six-\nmonth program, mentors and mentees were \nenrolled in a self-guided course in which they \nplanned, engaged with, and reflected on their \nmentorship sessions.With a program effectiveness rating of \n87%, the mentorship pilot has generated \nmeaningful conversations on career goal \nsetting and Applied\u2019s vision, mission, and \nleadership, and has furthered our culture \nof coaching and professional development. \nUsing the takeaways from the pilot, our next \nphase will be working with stakeholders to \ndesign custom mentorship programs for \nvarious internal organizations and regions.Learning and  \nDevelopment\u201cAs a recent graduate, I enjoy being in an \nengineering role that directly aids new product \ndevelopment.
