{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202177 Sustainability Report 2021Supplier Assessments and Audit\nApplied Materials employs a metrics-based \napproach to assessing supply chain ESG \nrisks and reflects these assessments in our \nsupplier scorecards. T o secure baseline \ndata, we require subsets of our suppliers (as \napplicable) to:\n > Complete annual self-assessment \nquestionnaires to measure their \nconformance to the RBA Code of \nConduct (top 80% of direct suppliers \nby spend, and 10% of high-risk \nindirect suppliers)\n > Complete an RBA Environmental \nSurvey to provide basic data on \nGHG emissions, energy use, water \nwithdrawal, and waste generation, \nplus qualitative data on reduction \ntargets and efforts (top 80% of direct \nsuppliers by spend)\n > Submit conflict minerals reporting \ntemplates, as well as an extended \nminerals reporting template (ERMT) if \napplicable, as part of our responsible \nminerals sourcing due diligence\n > Report on their performance under \nenvironmental regulationsWe conduct detailed evaluations of reported \ninformation and assign suppliers risk \nscores using a weighted risk matrix that \nencompasses ESG and other risk indicators. \nWe implement our SuCCESS2030 practices \nholistically, identifying gaps at every level, \nand provide suppliers the resources and tools \nthey need to comply and thrive, rather than \nfocusing corrective action solely on suppliers \nidentified as posing high ESG risks.\nFor a second year, COVID-19 forced us to \nemploy remote internal ESG audits for certain \nhigh-risk direct suppliers rather than going \non-site. Consistent with RBA provisions, \nApplied required 33% of our high-risk \nsuppliers to undergo an RBA external audit \nin 2021. This percentage is targeted to grow \nto 50% in 2022. We have contracted with \nan RBA-approved third-party audit firm to \nconduct such audits consistent with RBA \naudit standards.\nProtecting Human Rights \nin Our Supply Chain\nApplied Materials is unequivocally committed to protecting \nhuman rights and conducting business in an ethical and \nresponsible manner around the world. We condemn and are \ncommitted to ending forced and bonded labor in all its forms, \nincluding child labor, indentured labor, slavery, and human \ntrafficking.\nOur commitment to protecting human rights wherever we do \nbusiness is detailed in the policies and statements listed on \npage 51. We communicate our human rights commitments \nand requirements clearly to our supply chain and business \npartners to help ensure compliance with our expectations \naround humane treatment of the workforce and forbidding \nforced and bonded labor. We conduct due diligence on human \nrights risk in our supply chain and flag zero-tolerance issues in \nour supplier scorecards.\nView our Human Rights Statement of Pri nciples here .\nSustainability Report 2021 77INTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 76, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
