{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 2021 24\n Sustainability Report 2021 24Fight Against Hunger\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has \nexacerbated longstanding societal inequities, \nwith historically excluded communities \nexperiencing the most severe impact. In the \nfirst year of the pandemic, organizations \nworking to alleviate food insecurity at the \ncommunity level reported a 100% increase \nin demand for their services. While demand \ndecreased slightly in 2021, it remained above \nhistorical norms, and food banks had to \ncontend with additional pressures from high \nfood and transportation costs, supply chain \ndelays, and a lack of volunteers. \nT o do our part in addressing these \nchallenges, Applied employee teams across \nNorth America closed out the year with our \nannual Fight Against Hunger fundraising \neffort. During the campaign, which \nremained primarily virtual to prioritize \nhealth and safety, our employees raised \n$1.9 million, our most generous employee \ndonation total ever. Adding a dollar-for-\ndollar match from the Applied Materials \nFoundation, we were able to distribute over \n$3.8 million to 52 food banks across the \nU.S. and Canada.Global Fight Against Hunger efforts \ncontinued throughout the year, often \naligned with cultural and seasonal holidays \nin different countries. In Belgium, the \nNetherlands, Japan, and T aiwan, employee \nefforts benefited food banks. In Greece, our \npeople supported The Smile of the Child\u2019s \nwork providing meals to children living in \npoverty. In India, employee giving targeted \nmid-day meals for students through the \nAkshaya Patra Foundation, as well as year-\nround support for orphans living in group \nhomes. In China, our people filled and \ndistributed food packages, and in Israel \nthey supported the delivery of meals to \nHolocaust survivors. All these efforts reflect \nApplied\u2019s values and purpose, aligning who \nwe are with what matters to our employees \nand what\u2019s needed in our communities.INTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nCorporate Governance \nEthics & Compliance\nPublic Policy \nData & IP Security \nPersonal Data Privacy \nCommunity Impact\nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
