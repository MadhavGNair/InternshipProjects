{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202156\nScope 1 and 2 \nEmissions\nThe largest part of our Scope 1 and 2 \nfootprint is traceable to the power needs of \nour factories and labs, which represent our \nprimary opportunity for change. T o keep \nus on track toward our 100% renewable \nelectricity commitments (U.S. by 2022, \nglobal by 2030), we are partnering with an \nenergy consultant to develop a renewable \nenergy strategy and expand our renewable \nenergy portfolio.In 2021, Applied Materials\u2019 Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions totaled 93,272 metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), a 28% \ndecline from 2020 driven primarily by our \nnew VPPA for wind energy in west T exas. \nOur Scope 2 (market-based) emissions fell \nto 49,290 CO2e in 2021, a 38% decrease \nfrom 2020. However, our location-based \nemissions rose, primarily due to the \nopening of new Applied office buildings in \nCalifornia, new manufacturing facilities in \nSingapore, production expansion in T aiwan \nand overall production and business growth \nto meet unprecedented demand in the \nsemiconductor industry.Air emissions from our R&D processes \nare treated with point-of-use abatement \nunits and facility scrubbers before being \ndischarged to the atmosphere, consistent \nwith local or regional air permit requirements.EPA Green Power \nPartnership\n>  National T op-100 User of \nGreen Power\n> T op-30 T ech and T elecom\n> Fortune 500\u00ae Partners\nINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nClimate and Energy\nEnvironmental  \nHealth and Safety\nPROGRESS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
