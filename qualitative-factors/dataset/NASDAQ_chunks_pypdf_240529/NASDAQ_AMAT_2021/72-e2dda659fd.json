{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202173Enabling Recycling of \nFlexible Packaging\nAt our Flexible T echnology Group business \nunit in Germany, our sales, business \ndevelopment and design functions are working \nwith customers to develop new solutions to \nincrease the recyclability of food packaging \nmaterials. Spurred by impending regulatory \ntargets for reducing packaging waste, \ncompanies are committing to a full transition \nto biodegradable, recyclable, or renewable \nmaterials within the decade, and leveraging \nApplied\u2019s expertise with roll-to-roll vacuum \ncoating systems to help them get there.\nThe focus of this work is using our tools \nto create single-polymer alternatives (e.g., \nall-polypropylene pouches) to multilayered \naluminum-and-polymer films, making \nfood packaging easier to sort and recycle. \nThrough our own innovation and multiple \npartnerships, we are: > Improving barrier protection on BOPP, \nCPP, PE, BOPE, and MDOPE films to  \nallow mono-polymer solutions\n > Using new, advanced BOPP polymers \nin combination with Applied\u2019s vacuum-\ncoated barrier to achieve results \ncomparable to aluminum foil, with  \ngreater recyclability \n > Exploring new Metacoat and Nexus \ntopcoating and metallization options to \ngauge their effect on recyclability\n > Exploring barrier papers that are  \nboth renewable and biodegradable\n > Using our oxide coating technology to \nenable barrier improvements on  \npouches made from BOPEF film, a  \n100% bio-based polyester created  \nfrom renewable feedstocks\nFood packaging extends shelf life and \nprevents food waste, which already  \naccounts for as much as one eighth of  \nglobal GHG emissions. Through these  \nand other next-generation solutions,  \nwe are helping to build a circular economy  \nthat retains that embedded value while \nmitigating packaging\u2019s effects on our land, \nseas, and resources.Building a Circular \nEconomy for Flexible \nPackaging\nApplied Materials is a member of CEFLEX, a \ncollaborative initiative representing the full \nvalue chain of flexible packaging. CEFLEX stakeholders have endorsed a five-\nstep roadmap to building a circular economy \nfor flexible packaging, together with needed \nactions in each part of the value chain to make \nit happen. In early 2022, CEFLEX proposed \nsome revisions of its framework to align the \nindustry in anticipation of global action on \npackaging waste. Now many activities are in \nthe implementation phase.\n1\n2\n3 45Drive a collection of all flexible \npackaging for sorting and recycling\nSort and recycle the suitable \nmono-material fractions\nRedesign multi-material flexible packaging \nto mono-materials with existing recycling \nstreams where possibleIdentify solutions and develop \ncapabilities to sort and recycle \nthe remaining fractionsEnd markets for all recycled \nflexible packaging materialsINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 72, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
