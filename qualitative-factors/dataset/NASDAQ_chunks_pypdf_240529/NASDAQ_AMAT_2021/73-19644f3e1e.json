Third-party assessments validate \nthat our products meet applicable safety requirements.\nWe follow all relevant country- and region-\nspecific requirements. For example, products \ndistributed in China are marked with a \nmandatory \u201cChina RoHS 25\u201d label to comply \nwith the administrative measure on the control \nof pollution from electronic information \nproducts. Products sold in the European \nUnion comply with regional manufacturing \nand labeling requirements, including the CE \nmark affirming conformity with European \nhealth, safety, and environmental standards. \nProducts sold in the UK bear the similar UKCA \n(UK Conformity Assessed) mark. Relevant \nproducts sold in South Korea are tested to \nensure compliance with KC mark requirements \n(related to electromagnetic compatibility and \nelectrical safety requirements).Any business unit or group that develops, \nsells, or distributes products is required \nto design and engineer those products \nto protect both the user\u2019s personnel and \nfacilities and the environment from exposure \nto risks, and that any residual risks remain \nbelow a minimum acceptable level when \nthe products are operated, maintained, and \nserviced in accordance with the instructions \nand information provided to the user. Our \nProduct Safety group partners with other \ncompany functions to oversee the design of \nproducts and services, monitors their safety \nduring the product\u2019s lifecycle, and drives \ncompliance with our product safety policy \nand procedures. \nOur risk-assessment process follows the \napplicable SEMI S10 industry risk assessment \nguideline. In 2021, we enhanced our risk \nassessment procedure to consider additional \nrisks and address these risks during the product \ndesign and manufacturing process.Product Safety\nINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 73, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
