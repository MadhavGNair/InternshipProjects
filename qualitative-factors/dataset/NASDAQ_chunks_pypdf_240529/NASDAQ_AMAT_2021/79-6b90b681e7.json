For 2022, our goal is for \n2.5% of our total global spend to reside with \ncertified diverse suppliers. In addition, we are \npartnering with applicable existing suppliers \nto pursue their diversity certifications through \nthe Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National \nCouncil (WBENC) and National Minority \nSupplier Diversity Council (NMSDC).Beyond expanding our diverse supplier base, \nwe are also working to integrate equity and \ninclusion across our procurement operations, \nadding resiliency to our supply chain. In \nJune 2021, we hired a dedicated supplier \ndiversity program manager and began hosting \nwebinars to help our suppliers boost their \nown supplier diversity efforts. T o measure \nour progress in alignment with other supplier \ndiversity programs, we employ the RGMA \nFive Levels of Supplier Diversity framework. \nNear-term objectives include:\n > Launching trainings for senior \nexecutives, procurement professionals, \nand commodity business managers\n > Evaluating opportunities to increase \ndiverse spend within our Tier 1 and Tier \n2 supplier base\nOver the long term, we strive to build a \ntrue partnership with our suppliers to drive \ndiversity throughout our supply chain and set \na positive example for our industry, all while \nbetter meeting our business needs. \nDefining Diversity \nApplied Materials\u2019 diverse suppliers must be certified by \na third-party auditor as being at least 51% diverse owned, \ncontrolled, and operated by U.S. minorities (African-\nAmerican/Black, Hispanic/Latin-American, Native American, \nAsian-Pacific American, Asian-Indian American), women, \nminority women, LGBTQ, persons with disabilities, veterans, \nor service-disabled veterans. Applied Materials also tracks \nadditional diverse suppliers who could potentially be \nregistered as diverse if they proceed with certification.\nAs a founding member of SEMI\u2019s Manufacturing Ownership \nDiversity (MOD) working group, Applied Materials is \nworking to provide best practices for supplier diversity in the \nsemiconductor industry.\n \nSustainability Report 2021 80INTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 79, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
