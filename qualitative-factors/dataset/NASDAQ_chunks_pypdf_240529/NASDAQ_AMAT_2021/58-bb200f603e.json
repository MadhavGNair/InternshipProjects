{"page_content": "Using Remote Tools to  \nReduce Emissions \nCOVID-19 limitations on travel have sped the adoption of \ndistance-collaboration technologies, enabling both efficiencies \nand emissions reductions. In addition to videoconferencing \nand online training, Applied Materials is employing tools \nlike Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens mobile holographic device to \nenable remote testing and troubleshooting. Using HoloLens, \ncustomer site personnel and our remote technicians can \ncollaborate instantaneously to address issues, reducing air \ntravel and its associated time, expense, and emissions\u2014not to \nmention potential weeks spent in quarantine.
