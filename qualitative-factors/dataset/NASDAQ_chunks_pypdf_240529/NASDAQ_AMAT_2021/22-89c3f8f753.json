{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202123\nSustainability Report 202123Responding to Acute \nCommunity Need\nApplied Materials, the Applied Materials \nFoundation, and our 27,000 employees \nremain flexible in providing funding for \ncommunities severely impacted by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and \nsystemic racism.\nFor the past two-plus years, Applied and \nthe Foundation have stepped up to help \nthose most impacted by the COVID-19 \npandemic. These efforts have included \nproviding financial support to U.S. food banks \nand global relief organizations, delivering \nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) and \nother supplies to frontline medical personnel, \nproviding hand sanitizer to senior programs and homeless shelters, and ensuring \ndisadvantaged children and their families \nhave access to nutritious meals. In 2021, \nthe Foundation partnered with the Indian-\nAmerican Friendship Alliance to deliver \noxygen concentrators to India during that \ncountry\u2019s deadly Delta variant surge.\nAs Asian-Americans faced a wave of racist \nviolence across the U.S. inspired by COVID-19 \nmisinformation and anti-Asian rhetoric, the \nFoundation donated to Asian Americans \nAdvancing Justice to support their efforts to \ndocument hate and demand action.\nIn the wake of the February 2021 ice storms \nthat disrupted power grids across T exas, the \nFoundation provided funding to Caritas of \nAustin and the American Red Cross to aid \ncommunity relief efforts.Promoting Civic \nDevelopment\nIn 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued \nto adversely affect nonprofit organizations \nand the way they provide services. Applied \nand the Foundation responded by providing \ninfrastructural support to 94 community \norganizations, helping them become more \nefficient and grow their capacity to serve \nlocal needs, including through advocating for \naffordable housing and helping families in \nneed access housing and income assistance. \nThrough joint support from Applied and the \nFoundation, we hope to prevent families from \nbecoming homeless and to fund supportive \nservices and shelter for those who are already \nwithout a home. The following examples \nillustrate this approach in 2021:\n > In response to high numbers of \nhomeless youth in Portland, Oregon, \nand Austin, Texas, the Foundation \nfunded organizations such as New \nAvenues for Youth and LifeWorks, \nwhich help transition homeless youth to \nstable and safe housing. > In Silicon Valley, the Foundation \nprovided financial support for the \nexpansion of the Sunnyvale Community \nServices facility. With three times \nmore space, the new building allows \nimprovements in the management \nand delivery of current services and \nthe opportunity to offer new support \nservices to individuals and families. \n > In Arizona, the Foundation supported \nHouse of Refuge, Inc. and UMOM New \nDay Centers, Inc., which serve families \nin transition, provide safe housing and \noffer wrap-around services that help \nfamilies become financially stable. \n > In India, Applied supported SOS \nChildren\u2019s Villages, an organization \nproviding homes, nurturing care and \neducational support for children who \nhave been abandoned or orphaned.\nINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nCorporate Governance \nEthics & Compliance\nPublic Policy \nData & IP Security \nPersonal Data Privacy \nCommunity Impact\nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
