{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202169\nDesign for \nSustainability Center \nof Excellence\nWithin Applied\u2019s Systems Engineering \norganization, our Design for Sustainability \nCenter of Excellence (DfSu) analyzes both \nin-design and existing semiconductor product \nsets to identify new reduction opportunities \nfor energy, water, waste, and chemicals.\nThis design support expands our product \ngroups\u2019 responsibilities beyond traditional \nperformance attributes to include \nsustainability performance\u2014adding new \nfeatures to our existing portfolio of energy-\nsaving product enhancements, passing on \nsubstantial energy saving opportunities to \nour customers, and modeling sustainability \nleadership industry-wide.\nIn Bengaluru, India, the DfSu concept and \nprototyping lab works closely with our U.S. \nproduct design teams on development \nwork dedicated to improving sustainability \nperformance. The DfSu has developed \na library of solutions that contribute \nto improved sustainability in Applied\u2019s \nproducts, created 3x30 metrics to \nnormalize comparisons between tools and \nbusiness units, and promoted standardized \nmethodologies to drive energy/ chemical use \nreductions. In 2021, these efforts included: > Designing gas panels to reduce exhaust \nflows by 50% to 80%\n > Evaluating new chiller and heat-\nexchanger technologies to reduce \nenergy and water consumption\n > Modifying process chamber lid designs \nfor reduced coolant flow\n > Testing and evaluating alternative heat-\ntransfer/cooling fluids to reduce our \nequipment\u2019s GHG footprint and comply \nwith regulations and restrictions around \nhigh global warming potential (GWP) \nrefrigerants\n > Evaluating next-generation and \nalternative components created by \noutside suppliers to quantify their \nimpact on our overall system footprint \nand drive operational efficiencies\n > Quantifying the impact of using new \ngreen components to drive adoption of \nmore sustainable solutions\nGrowth Technical Advisory \nBoard (GTAB)\nLed by our CTO and comprised of technology experts from \nindustry, academia, and government, Applied Materials\u2019 GTAB \nadvises on ways our products and technologies can address \nchallenges, create opportunities, and enable a better future. \nSustainability Report 2021 69INTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 68, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
