{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202158Scope 3 Emissions\nIn early 2022, we completed our 2019  \nScope 3 emissions inventory baseline.\nAmong the 15 categories defined by the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol, Category 11, \nUse of Sold Products, represents by far \nour largest share of Scope 3 emissions. \nThis category denotes the combined total \nemissions from all Applied semiconductor \nproducts sold during a reporting year \n(including emissions from both the \ntechnology\u2019s energy draw in customer \nfabs and the chemicals and gases used in \noperational processes), estimated over the \naverage lifetime of those products. Category \n1, Purchased Goods and Services, represents \na large portion of Applied\u2019s estimated supply \nchain emissions and is the second largest \ncontributor to our Scope 3 footprint.\nThere is no semiconductor industry standard \nfor measuring Category 11 emissions, \nbut we have chosen to build on the SEMI \nS23 standard (related to energy, utilities, \nand material use efficiency) to model our \ntools\u2019 energy consumption and estimate \nCategory 11 emissions. For the purposes \nof our assessment, we include emissions \nnot only from sold products but also from \ncertain non-Applied ancillary and sub-fab \nequipment required for the tools\u2019 operation, such as pumps, cooling systems, and point-\nof-use abatement systems. Our calculation \nassumes an average 10-year product lifespan \nacross all Applied tools and technologies. \nHowever, because customers and third \nparties frequently extend the life of Applied \nproducts through refurbishment (a plus for \ncircularity and reuse, but a complication for \nGHG accounting), we will continue to review \nand refine our estimates and assumptions.\nSemiconductor products represent the vast \nmajority of Applied\u2019s annual product sales. \nIn next year\u2019s report we will expand our \nCategory 11 calculations to include our sale of \nDisplay products\u2019 emissions.Calculating our 2019 Scope 3 baseline \ninventory was just the beginning. Applied \nwill continue to review our Scope 3 \nmethodology each year to continuously \nrefine the calculations, emissions factors, \ndata, estimates and underlying assumptions \naiming to replace Environmentally Extended \nInput\u2013Output (EEIO) with primary data \nwherever possible, and we will report \nany resulting changes and implications. \nA complete overview of our Scope 3 \nmethodology can be found here .Though strategies adopted in pursuit of \nour 3x30 and SuCCESS30 goals are already \ndriving reductions across our largest Scope \n3 categories, we are currently evaluating \nscience-based targets (SBT s) across Scope \n1, 2, and 3 emissions to align our goals with \nthe latest climate science. T o achieve the \ngreatest impact in reducing emissions from \nthe use of sold products, we will pursue \ncollaboration across the semiconductor \nindustry to (a) align on standards for \nmeasuring semiconductor product emissions \nand (b) collectively implement initiatives to \ndrive down emissions in line with SBT s.\nINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nClimate and Energy\nEnvironmental  \nHealth and Safety\nPROGRESS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
