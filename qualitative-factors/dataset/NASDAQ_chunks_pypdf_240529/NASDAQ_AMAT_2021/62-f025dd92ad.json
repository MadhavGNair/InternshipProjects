{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202163Waste Management\nApplied is committed to minimizing waste \nacross our locations and logistics operations, \nwith a special focus on non-recyclable, \nlandfill-bound waste.\nWaste reduction, reuse, and recycling \nprograms are managed at the site level and \nhave been successful in minimizing waste \ngeneration (for example, by reducing printed \ndocumentation), increasing reuse and \nrecycling of product and packaging materials, \nsorting recyclables at point of disposal, and \nmaximizing composting of organic materials \nfrom our cafeteria operations. Waste \nmanagement targets are set for individual \nmanufacturing sites based on the ISO 14001 \nframework and are reviewed on an ongoing \nbasis and scored annually.\nIn 2021, we increased our diversion rate from \nlandfill/incineration from 75% in 2020 to \n76% in 2021 and achieved a 12% reduction \nin hazardous waste generation. However, our \nnon-hazardous waste generation increased \nby 50% due to increased activity at our \nmanufacturing sites and better data reporting.See the Design for Sustainability  section for \ninformation on our responsible product and \npackaging initiatives.\nHazardous Waste Management: Hazardous \nwaste accounted for 2% of our annual \nwaste output in 2021. We contract with \nlicensed third parties to transport waste \n(including hazardous waste) for off-site \ndisposal, consistent with applicable laws and \nregulations. Our EHS organization provides \noversight of third-party hazardous material \ndisposal companies and verifies that all \ndisposal sites and methods meet regulatory \nrequirements. We also evaluate potential \nvendors via the CHWMEG Facility Review \nProgram, which provides environmental, \noperational, and financial information on \nwaste treatment, disposal, recycling, and \nstorage facilities.\nWastewater Management: Applied strives to \nreduce the negative impacts of wastewater \nproduced by our operations, monitoring \nto ensure sufficient removal of solids and \nadherence to permitted parameters (e.g., \npH and fluoride content) before discharge \nto publicly owned treatment works. Each \nApplied facility is responsible for wastewater \nmonitoring, with problems escalated to \nthe site management team and applicable \ncorporate staff for immediate correction.METRIC TONS\nTOTAL WASTE GENERATION 22,900\nDiversion rate 76%\nTOTAL NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE 22,500\nDiverted non-hazardous waste 12,800\nNon-hazardous waste to landfill/incineration 5,400\nCompost 4,2002021 Waste Performance\nINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nClimate and Energy\nEnvironmental  \nHealth and Safety\nPROGRESS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 62, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
