{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202178Responsible \nMinerals Sourcing\nApplied Materials is committed to the \nresponsible sourcing of minerals used in \nour products.\nKey to this commitment is our policy around \ntantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold, commonly \nreferred to as 3TG or conflict minerals for \ntheir frequent origin in the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining \ncountries affected by conflict and human \nrights abuses. Since 2019, Applied Materials \nhas retained Assent Compliance (\u201cAssent\u201d), \na third-party service provider, to assist Applied in conducting outreach to suppliers \nregarding their use of 3TG in products \nfurnished to Applied, and evaluating their \nresponses and smelter engagements.\nWhile our products include components \nmanufactured with 3TG, we neither \npurchase these minerals directly nor \nmaintain any direct relationship with mines, \nsmelters or refiners that process these \nminerals. Our Responsible Minerals Sourcing \nPolicy communicates our commitment to \ndue diligence and disclosure and guides our  \ndirect suppliers\u2019 sourcing of 3TG minerals.  \nT o assure the efficacy of our policy, we  \nutilize the Responsible Minerals Initiative \n(RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process as well as independent third-party \naudits. In calendar 2021, we reviewed the \nlist of suppliers we surveyed for calendar \nyear 2020 and identified those who for \nthree consecutive years had responded \nthat the products they sold to Applied \ndid not contain conflict minerals. Assent \nreached out to these suppliers on our behalf \nand requested that they provide Conflict \nMinerals Reporting T emplates. In addition, \nin an effort to reach suppliers with lower \nspend, we directly contacted almost all \ndirect suppliers with a request for conflict \nminerals information. T ogether, these two \ngroups of suppliers represent approximately \n92% of our total supplier spend in 2021. \nApproximately 97% of the suppliers \nsurveyed by Assent responded. Due to \nthe unprecedented business growth and \nchanging roles and responsibilities among \nsuppliers, nine surveyed suppliers were \nunable to provide T emplates.\nBeyond 3TG, we also conduct due diligence \non suppliers from whom we source products \nlikely to contain cobalt, a frequently DRC-\nsourced mineral that has been tied to child \nlabor, unsafe working conditions and adverse \nenvironmental impacts. In 2020, Applied \nworked with Assent to request Cobalt \nReporting T emplates (CRT) from suppliers \nexpected to have cobalt in the products they furnish to Applied. Starting in 2021, Applied \nbegan requesting instead an Extended \nMinerals Reporting T emplate (\u201cEMRT\u201d), \nwhich covers cobalt and mica. The EMRT \nreplaced the Cobalt Reporting T emplate and \nis expected to cover a growing list of minerals \nas the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) \nand its partner organizations develop a \nbroader responsible minerals sourcing \nprogram. In 2021, this effort garnered a 100% \nresponse rate. Looking ahead, we intend to \nexpand due diligence to the copper, nickel, \nlead, zinc, and mica used in our products, \nconsistent with RMI guidance.\nIn 2021, Applied Materials joined Copper Mark \nas one of its first partners, along with Ford \nMotor Company, Google, Intel and Wieland. \nCopper Mark aims to improve the responsible \nproduction practices of the copper industry, in \npart by developing and supporting criteria for \nresponsible mineral production and sourcing. \nWe participate in their three working groups, \nwith a focus on the Due Diligence Working \nGroup, which aims to support ethical copper \nsourcing practices.\nINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 77, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
