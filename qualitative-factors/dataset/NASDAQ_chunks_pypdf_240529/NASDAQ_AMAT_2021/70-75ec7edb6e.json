This \nsystem is currently undergoing testing. Earlier \nTSMC energy-saving measures developed \nfrom iSystemTM data have resulted in annual \nelectricity savings of 5.1 million kWh, GHG \nreductions of 9,700 MT CO2e, and cost \nbenefits of US$2.4 million.\nIn 2021, we continued to reduce area per \nwafer pass on Metal Deposition products \n(>30%), ALD products (>25%), and Etch \nproducts (>15%).As we develop new tools, upgrade existing \nsystems and create advanced service products, \nwe proactively communicate their potential \nfor cost reductions, yield improvements and \nsustainability benefits to our customers.\nOLED Displays: Superior Viewing and Efficiency\nT o take next-generation technologies mainstream, manufacturers need the tools to simplify fabrication, drive down production \ncosts, and make consumer prices competitive. That\u2019s what we offered them in the 2000s, when our equipment helped \nusher in the era of flat-panel LCD displays to replace older CRT s. Now Applied\u2019s advanced manufacturing tool suites are \ndoing it again for revolutionary OLED mobile, TV, and computer displays, which offer superior image quality, cooler running \ntemperatures, and lower energy consumption. iSystem\u2122\nGas Usage\nReporting\niSystem\u2122\nEnergy\nReporting\niSystem\u2122\nEnergy\nSavings\niSystem\u2122\nAnomaly\nDetectioniSystem\u2122\nSleep\nModeACHIEVE ENERGY SAVINGS\n- Idle & sleep modes\n- Dry pumps & abatement including backup\n- Continuous improvement\nENERGY PERFORMANCE REPORTING\n- Performance reports & Subfab Equipment KPIs\n- Baseline & Savings Auto-calculation (ISO50001)\n- Precisely manage energy usage & sub-fab operation \nANOMALY DETECTION\n- Overlay of process & subfab information\n- Integration of existing sensors\n- Detection of trends ENERGY PERFORMANCE REPORTING\n >Performance reports & Subfab Equipment KPIs\n >Baseline & Savings Auto-calculation (ISO50001)\n >Precisely manage energy usage & sub-fab operation ACHIEVE ENERGY SAVINGS\n >Idle & sleep modes\n >Dry pumps & abatement \nincluding backup\n >Continuous improvementINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 70, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
