{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202170Chemical Impact MetricModeling \nSustainability \nand Efficiency\nDesigned in-house, our web-based modeling \ntool analyzes design and end-user data \nto pinpoint sustainability improvements \nfor legacy, in-production, and design-\nstage semiconductor manufacturing tools. \nModeling efforts support our 3x30 goals of \nreducing energy use, chemical consumption, \nand the equipment\u2019s physical footprint to \nincrease throughput density per square foot \nof cleanroom space. By modeling tools early \nin the design process, our product design \nengineers gain the data they need to reduce \na tool\u2019s projected resource consumption \nand other environmental impacts before \nthe tool goes into production. Analysis of \nexisting tools supports identification of \nprocess efficiency improvements that we \ncan communicate to our customers to boost \nsustainability performance in their fabs.In 2021, we completed an effort to set  \nenergy consumption baselines (2019  \nbasis) for our complete line of SPG \nsemiconductor products, a process  \nthat will help drive further improvement  \nand also inform calculation of our  \nScope 3 emissions in Category 11 (use  \nof sold products).\nIn addition, we completed our first-in-  \nthe-industry chemical impact analysis  \nand began leveraging the results to  \nimprove tool and process design, including \nefforts to reduce, eliminate, and/ or replace \nthe most negatively impactful chemicals  \nused by our tools. Baselining our chemical \nimpacts in GHG equivalents also  \ncontributes to our Scope 3 assessments.UPSTREAM\nIMPACTS\nPOST-\nABATEMENT\nEMISSIONSCRADLE -TO-GATE\nGATE -TO-GATE\nDIRECT PROCESS\nDRAINS\n(IF PRESENT)\nABATEMENT\nDRAINSDRAIN\nIMPACTSBy-product Chemicals\nAbatementProcess ChamberChemical Production \n& Transportation\nSustainability Report 2021 70 Sustainability Report 2021 70INTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 69, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
