 \n\uf0b7 OSHA Injury and Illness Recordkeeping and Reporting definitions;  \n\uf0b7 GRI Standards version of 2020 for Water and effluents (303) ; Applied Materials\u2019 \ninternal reporting criteria and definitions for community impact and workforce data.  \nAssurance \nstandard  ERM CVS\u2019 assurance methodology, based on the International Sta ndard on Assurance \nEngagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) .  \nAssurance level Limited assurance \nRespective \nresponsibilities  Applied Materials is responsible for preparing the Report and for the collection and \npresentation of the information within it.  \nERM CVS\u2019 responsibility is to provide conclusions on the agreed scope based on the \nassurance activities performed and exercisin g our professional judgement.  \nOur conclusions  \nBased on our activities , as described below,  nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the 2021  data \nand information for the disclosures listed under \u2018Scope\u2019 above are not fairly presented, in all material respects, \nwith the reporting criteria . \n \nOur assurance activities    \nA multi -disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed a range of assurance procedures \nwhich varied across the disclosures covered by our assurance engagement , as follows:    \n\uf0b7 A review of internal reporting guidelines  and procedures , including unit conversion s, estimations , \nemission factors  and assumptions used;  \n\uf0b7 A walk -through of the reporting and data management systems used for each indicator group \n(Workforce, Environmental, Health & Safety and Community Impact data programs);  \n\uf0b7 Interviews with data owners at corporate level (e.g. environmental, social, health & safety and \ncommunity impact)  to understand the data consolidation process and internal controls ; \n\uf0b7 An analytical review of fiscal year 2021 full year data by conducting a year -over-year analysis per site \nfor the selected indicators which included testing the completeness and accuracy of data ; \n\uf0b7 Virtual site visits to four si tes (Alzenau in Germany, Xian Campus in China, and Bowers Campus and \nHarris Branch Campus in the USA)  to understand local reporting processes, data management and \nreporting;  \n\uf0b7 Desktop review of underlying source data for site visits , Scope 3  and renewable energy  calculations;  \n\uf0b7 A review of alignment of indicators with the established reporting criteria;  \n\uf0b7 An evaluation of the consistency of definitions used to classify data for the health & safety and \nworkforce -related indicators;  \n\uf0b7 Testing of a sample of underlying data on transactions, cases and profiles for the community impact, \nhealth & safety and workforce indicators respectively;  \n\uf0b7 An in -person  head office visit to review outcomes of Applied Ma terials internal QA/QC process,  \nincluding changes made to fiscal year 2021  data following the findings from the site visits and other \nassurance testing carried out , and to have in -depth discussions around 2019 Scope 3 GHG emissions \ncalculations methodologies used and Corporate -level source d ata for the categories included ; and  \n\uf0b7 Reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the Report to ensure \nconsistency with our findings.  \n \nThe limitations of our engagement  \nThe reliability of the assured performance data is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods \nfor determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance \nconclusion in this context.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any third party \nusing or placing reliance on our opinion in order to make a decisions related to Applied Materials.  \n \nForce -majeure  \nPrior to our assurance engagement, travel restrictio ns were imposed following the outbreak of COVID -19. As a \nresult of these, we agreed to replace in person site visits with \u2018virtual\u2019 visits via conference and video calls for \nthis year\u2019s assurance engagement. While we believe these changes do not affect our  limited assurance \nconclusion above, we draw attention to the possibility that if we had undertaken in person visits, we may have \nidentified errors and omissions in the assured information that we did not discover through the alternative \nassurance program.   \n \n \n Our independence  \nERM CVS is a member of the ERM Group. The work that ERM CVS conducts for clients is solely related to \nindependent assurance activities and auditor training. Our processes are designed and implemented to ensure \nthat the work we undertake with clients is fre e from bias and conflict of interest. ERM CVS and the staff that \nhave undertaken work on this assurance exercise provide no consultancy related services to Applied Materials  \nin any respect.  \n \nOur Observations  \nWe have provided Applied Materials with a separate management report with our detailed (non -material) \nfindings and recommendations.  \n \n \nBeth Wyke  \nHead of Corporate  Assurance  Services  \n \n28 June 2022  \n \n \nERM Certification and Verification Services, Inc . \nwww.ermcvs.com   Email: post@ermcvs.com\n \n \n \n \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 82, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
