{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202153\nSustainability Report 202153The latest report from the United Nations \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) advises that our window to keep \nglobal warming well below 2\u00b0 Celsius in \npursuit of 1.5\u00b0 is closing rapidly, and the \ncurrent trajectory for global emissions \nreductions is not going to get us there.\nAt Applied, we recognize we have a \nunique opportunity to accelerate the \ntransformation to a sustainable digital \neconomy. At the same time, we embrace \nour responsibility to significantly reduce  \nour own environmental impacts.\nIn 2021, we gained a more holistic picture \nof those impacts by quantifying our Scope 3 \nemissions inventory. This paves the way for \nsetting validated science-based targets in \nalignment with the Paris Agreement.\nWe also completed Phase 2 of our Climate \nRisk Assessment, giving us more insight into \nclimate-related risks to our business. These \ninsights help inform the strategic investments \nand operational improvements to grow our \nresilience for a rapidly evolving climate. In \nalignment with the T ask Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we \nare sharing insights from this analysis below \nand in our 2021 Report Annex , along with \ninsights from the physical risk assessment we \ncompleted in 2020. \nAs our energy demands increase with the \nexpansion of our facilities and increasing \nproduction demands, we continue to drive \nstrong progress against our global 100% \nrenewable electricity goal. We are 80% of \nthe way toward our goal in the U.S., primarily \nthrough leveraging partnerships with \ncommunity choice aggregators (CCAs) and \npurchasing renewable energy certificates \n(RECs) through our utility providers. Now, \nwith our White Mesa Wind Virtual Power \nPurchase Agreement (VPPA) operational, \nwe are well positioned to reach our U.S. \nrenewable electricity sourcing goal and offset \na large portion of our U.S. footprint.We are working to reduce our footprint  as we advance \ntechnology to accelerate a sustainable digital economy.\nProtect our Planet  \nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\n>   Reported our carbon impact and risks in line with \nTCFD recommendations\n>   Quantified our 2019 Scope 3 emissions inventory \nbaseline.
