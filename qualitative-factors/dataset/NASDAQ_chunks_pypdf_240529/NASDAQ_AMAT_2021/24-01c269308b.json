Foundation \nfunding enabled grantees to deliver virtual, \nhybrid, and/ or in-person after-school and \nsummer programming and connect girls and \ntheir caregivers to local community service \nagencies to address need. All told, grantees \nwere able to serve almost 6,000 girls, 69% of \nwhom identify as Black, Latinx, or Indigenous \nand 64% of whom come from low-income \nbackgrounds.
