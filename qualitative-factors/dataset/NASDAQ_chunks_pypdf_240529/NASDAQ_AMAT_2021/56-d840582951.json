{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202157\nPowering Growth with Renewables\nThe accelerating digitization of the global economy is creating urgent demand \nfor semiconductors, and Applied Materials is mobilizing our enterprise to \ndeliver the equipment and expertise to meet that demand. At the same time, \nwe understand our success as a business must not come at the expense of \nthe climate and environment. \nThat\u2019s why we are continually seeking new opportunities in the low-carbon \neconomy, such as entering into a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement with \nWhite Mesa Wind, a new, 500-megawatt wind project in Crockett County, \nT exas. Combining the generating power of 180 turbines, White Mesa began \ncommercial operations on October 22, 2021, delivering clean power to \noffset a large percentage of our U.S. footprint. As our business grows, we \nwill continue innovating operational efficiencies and seeking new renewable \nenergy projects to fulfill our climate commitments.\nSustainability Report 2021Renewable Energy\nIn 2020, Applied Materials committed \nto 100% renewable electricity use in the \nU.S. by 2022 and globally by 2030. Our \nglobal renewable energy strategy enables \nachievement of those targets via three \ncomplementary approaches:\n > On-site solar power generation:   \nApplied Materials maintains on-site  \nsolar generating capacity at our facilities \nin Singapore; Austin, TX; Bangalore,  \nIndia; and Xi\u2019an, China. Combined, these \narrays generated 286 MWh of clean \npower in 2021.\n > Utility green procurement programs: \nDirect purchase of renewable energy \nfrom a utility provider.  >Virtual Power Purchase Agreements:  \nFinancial contracts with external solar, \nwind, and other renewable energy \ngenerating projects reduce our Scope 2 \nemissions inventory by delivering clean \npower to the grid. Each Renewable Energy \nCertificate (REC) provided by project \nowners represents the environmental \nbenefits of 1MWh of electricity generated \nfrom renewable sources. \nIn 2021, Applied used over 245,000 MWh \nof green power from a combination of these \nsourcing strategies, representing 80% of \nour total U.S. and 57% of our total global \nelectricity needs for the year. We continue \nto evaluate further renewable energy \nprojects and in 2021 began partnering with \nsustainability consultant 3Degrees to define \na roadmap for expanding our renewable \nelectricity supply globally and reaching our \n2030 100% renewable electricity goal. \nRenewable Electricity Use Over Time\n572019 2020 202142% 41%80%\n37% 37%57%% Global Renewable % US RenewableINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nClimate and Energy\nEnvironmental  \nHealth and Safety\nPROGRESS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 56, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
