{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202175\nSustainability Report 202175Supply Chain  \nResponsibility \nIn 2021, the global supply chain crisis, global \nsemiconductor shortage, and ongoing COVID-19 \npandemic affected our supply chain operations  in ways \nlarge and small but did not prevent us from achieving \nprogress on our supply chain goals. \nThroughout the year, we also saw a \nsignificant uptick in employee and team \ninvestment, enthusiasm, and shared \nresponsibility around achieving the goals \nof our SuCCESS2030 initiative, a 10-year \nroadmap for extending our sustainability \nvision across the supply chain for our \nsemiconductor and display businesses. \nUnder SuCCESS2030, our assessments \nof supplier performance and capabilities \nrequire shared commitments in five main \nESG focus areas, most of which include \ndefined performance targets.  > Supplier Responsibility, Engagement, \nand Assessment:  Applied strives to be \na partner to our suppliers, providing \nresources, guidelines, tools, and \ntrainings to build capacity on advancing \nsustainable practices. We also support \nour suppliers and sub-tier suppliers \nin their efforts to conform to the \nResponsible Business Alliance (RBA) \ncode of conduct. From this baseline, we \ncan better gauge progress using RBA \nassessments and audits. > Inclusion and Supplier Diversity: \nMirroring our own I&D journey, \nSuCCESS2030 promotes development \nof robust diversity strategies \nthroughout our supply chain. Our \nnear-term supplier diversity targets \ninclude increased representation of \nwomen and other underrepresented \ngroups and increased percentage \nspend with women- and minority-\nowned businesses, all by 2024. \nWe are also working with our trade \nassociations to significantly grow the \npipeline of diverse talent available to \nthe industry by 2030.\n > Packaging:  Our precision tools \nand products require carefully \ndesigned packaging to avoid damage \nduring transport, and we are \ncontinuously exploring strategies to \nreduce packaging waste, including \nredesigning cases and crates for \nreuse, using recyclable material such \nas corrugated fiberboard for boxes, \nand doing testing and measurement \nto gauge the feasibility of reducing \nvirgin materials usage.\n >Transportation and Logistics: To \nreduce emissions from airfreight, we \nare exploring the use of intermodal \nshipping options that can deliver \nproduct within a reasonable time frame. > Wastewater:  Though our own \noperations are neither water-intensive \nnor major emitters of wastewater, \nwe recognize the need to reduce \nour industry\u2019s large footprint in both \nareas. At suppliers with the requisite \ncapabilities, we are exploring a process \nof pre-treating metal surfaces for rust \nprotection using zinc oxide. The new \nprocess replaces phosphates, which \ncan damage aquatic systems when \nreleased in wastewater.\nSuCCESS2030 strengthens Applied\u2019s ESG \nsupply chain strategy, building on our \nfoundation of supporting ethical labor \npractices, environmentally responsible \noperations, responsible minerals sourcing, \nand other programs promoting adherence \nto industry standards and international \nhuman rights standards. SuCCESS2030 is \nmanaged through our SuCCESS2030 Office, \nwhich oversees metrics and compliance \naudits and conducts training and \ncoordination with participating suppliers. \nAcross our operations, we conduct pilot \nprograms to test new efficiency and waste-\nreduction processes, with the intention \nof sharing key learnings with our supplier \npartners and magnifying positive impacts \nacross the industry.INTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 74, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
