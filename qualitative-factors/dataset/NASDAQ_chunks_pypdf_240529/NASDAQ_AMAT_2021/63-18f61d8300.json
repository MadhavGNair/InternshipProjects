{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202164\nWater Management \nAlthough Applied\u2019s operations are not high-\nvolume water consumers relative to our \nindustry, we strive to optimize our water \nuse. Our R&D labs account for our highest \nconsumption of ultrapure water, followed by \nour manufacturing operations, routine use at \nour offices, and landscape irrigation  \naround our properties. In manufacturing,  \nonly a few of our toolsets require significant \nwater, with others relying on efficient \nclosed-loop systems. In 2021, our total \nwater withdrawal increased by 23.5% \nover 2020. The increase is a result of \nincreased groundwater usage due to piping \nmodifications and replacements in our Santa \nClara facilities. However, we were able to \ndecrease our use of irrigation water by 25%.Facilities groups are responsible for water \nuse management at specific Applied sites, \nwith oversight from the company\u2019s EHS \norganization. Our Managing Director \nof EHS is responsible for ensuring that \nwater-related risks and minimization \nopportunities are assessed as appropriate. \nWater reduction is covered under our EHS \npolicy and ISO 14001 EHSMS, which call \nfor our business operations to identify \nopportunities, make continual improvements \non environmental preservation and natural \nresource conservation, and meet or exceed \nall relevant regulatory requirements.\nOur water conservation efforts include:\n >Designing water-efficient products, \nfollowing best practices for tool design \nand specifications for water use \noutlined in SEMI industry requirements\n >Water recycling and reuse for non-\npotable applications, especially cooling \nand landscape irrigation\n >Rainwater collection for use in \nlandscaping or non-production needs \n(at our Singapore Operations Center \nand Tainan Manufacturing Center 2)\n >Drought-tolerant landscaping and \nsmart irrigation to reduce the number \nof watering days\nSustainability Report 2021 64INTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nClimate and Energy\nEnvironmental  \nHealth and Safety\nPROGRESS\nWater Performance (ML) \n2019TOTAL WATER WITHDRAWAL (ML)2020 2021050010001500200025003000\n1,962  ML 2,035  ML2,512  ML", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 63, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
