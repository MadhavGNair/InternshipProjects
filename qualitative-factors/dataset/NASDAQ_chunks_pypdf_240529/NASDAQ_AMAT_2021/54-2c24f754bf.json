{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202155\nSustainability Report 202155Climate Risks\nApplied Materials monitors current and \nemerging climate-related risks on an annual \nbasis. Responsibility for identifying company-\nwide and site-specific risks rests with a \ncore team of global emergency response, \ncrisis management, and business continuity \npersonnel, as well as local facilities teams  \nand Environmental Health and Safety \n(EHS) and Sustainability teams. Our risk \nidentification, mitigation and management \nplans help ensure our ability to recover \nquickly from climate-related events and \neffectively support our customers\u2019 and \nsuppliers\u2019 operations.For the past two years, we have engaged \na third party to conduct a Climate Risk \nAssessment to identify key physical and \ntransition risks and opportunities in line \nwith TCFD recommendations. In 2020 we \ncompleted Phase 1, which assessed Applied \nMaterials\u2019 physical risks utilizing three \ndifferent Representative Concentration \nPathways (RCPs) representing low-, \nmoderate-, and high-risk climate change \nscenarios for 2019 (baseline), 2030,  \nand 2050. The assessment considered Applied\u2019s risk \nexposure across our global operations by \nidentifying our highest-risk assets and \noperations based on various chronic and \nacute geographical climate hazard indicators.\nPhase 2 of the Climate Risk Assessment \nconcluded in March 2022, providing  \ninsights on Applied\u2019s projected transition \nrisks associated with the shift to a low-\ncarbon economy between 2025 and  \n2050. Benchmarked against our industry \npeers, the assessment gauges relative risk \nlevels across four key areas in which climate risk mitigation/ adaptation strategies may \nshift asset values and raise business and \ncompliance costs: policy and legal, market, \nreputation and technology.\nSee the TCFD Index  in our  \nReport Annex for assessment results.\nINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nClimate and Energy\nEnvironmental  \nHealth and Safety\nPROGRESSClimate and Energy\nAlthough our overall energy use rose by approximately \n7% in 2021, driven by both the addition of new facilities \nand increased production at our existing sites, we still \nmanaged to reduce our overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions \nfootprint by 28%.  Given the strong and increasing \ndemand for our products, we anticipate continued robust \ngrowth over the coming decade and are taking steps to \nlimit the environmental impacts of that growth.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 54, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
