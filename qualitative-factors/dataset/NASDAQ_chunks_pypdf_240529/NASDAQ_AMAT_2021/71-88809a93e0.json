{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202172\nSustainability Report 202172Promoting the  \nCircular Economy\nApplied Materials works to promote the circular \neconomy vision  by eliminating waste through design, \ncreating efficiencies across the product lifecycle, and \nemploying materials that can be reused or recycled at \nthe end of a product\u2019s functional life.\nRemanufacturing Semiconductor \nSystems and Parts\nOur systems are designed to last, to \nsupport upgrades and repurposing for new \napplications, and to be easily repairable if \nparts fail or performance falls belowacceptable standards. All newly \nmanufactured parts are engineered \nfor greater repairability, and we use \nrefurbished parts whenever possible for \nrepair and remanufacture, contributing to \nsustainability and cost-effectiveness.Expanding repairability:  By reviewing all \nparts for the potential to repair, we\u2019ve grown \nthe percentage of repaired parts we use to \nservice tools under contract from 65% to \nmore than 70% over the past three years. \nIn a cross-functional effort, new parts are \nidentified for potential repairability during \nnew product introductions, and our service \nengineering group identifies used parts that \ncan be confirmed for repair. We continue \nto look at parts that come into contact with \nprocess chemicals for potential repair or \ncleaning/reuse solutions.\nRecovery and reuse:  Within AGS, a \ndedicated team specializes in recovering \nparts and assemblies from the market and \nreconditioning them for reuse, thereby \nreducing our manufacturing operation\u2019s need \nfor virgin materials. Each recovered part goes \nthrough an exacting process of inspection, \ndecontamination, refurbishment, and repair, and is then recertified by AGS as \u201clike \nnew\u201d for reuse and recirculation, with a full \nwarranty and the same service level as a new \npart. On average, 40% of the parts used for \nservicing Applied Materials tools have been \nrefurbished after previous use in an Applied \nsystem. We are constantly improving our \nrefurbishment processes to grow that number \nby encompassing more part categories\u2014for \nexample, electrostatic chucks, whose reuse \nrate has increased 11% over the past three \nyears. We maintain one of the industry\u2019s \nlargest global inventories of spare parts, with \nrecovered parts searchable in our inventory \nmanagement system and ready to be pulled \nfor cleaning and reconditioning.\n\u201cComing from a technology startup where you\u2019re able to be extremely entrepreneurial in each \nof your initiatives, I thought I might face more limitations coming into a large, established \ncorporation. Pleasantly, I found the opposite to be true. Applied has a culture of openness to \ndifferent perspectives and new ways of tackling challenges.\u201d \nAmy\nMarketing Communications\nINTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 71, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
