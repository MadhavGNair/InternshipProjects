{"page_content": "Sustainability Report 202179Packaging Reduction \nand Reuse\nOur precision products require carefully \ndesigned packaging to avoid damage from \nshock and vibration during transport. In 2021, \nwe launched a new Design for Distribution \ntask force to encourage up-front planning \nand develop smarter packaging strategies \nthat meet those demands while improving \nsustainability via materials reduction, \nimproved recyclability, and reusability. \nIn 2021, approximately 75% of our packaging \nmaterials were made from recyclable materials \n(polyethylene, polypropylene, corrugated \nfiberboard, steel, and wood), many of which \nare also reusable. We also enacted new \nsupplier specifications that prohibit the use \nof certain packaging materials (including \npolystyrene) and require suppliers to report \nmaterials data, improving our ability to track \nour packaging\u2019s recyclable content. Going forward, we are developing processes \nto track and enforce compliance with those \nspecifications.\nOngoing initiatives are detailed below.\nLighter Polyethylene Bags  \nT o save materials, we are moving from  \n6 mil to 4 mil thickness for our low-density \npolyethylene (LDPE) bags. By year-end \nFY2022 we anticipate a >75% conversion  \nrate globally for bags purchased directly for \nfinal goods.\n\u201cJust Strong Enough\u201d Crates  \nWhere earlier wooden crate designs tended \nto be overbuilt for most use cases, our new, \nlighter crates are matched to the precise \nneeds of individual products. In 2021, this \nstrategy saved some 271,000 pounds of crate \nmaterials, and continuing efforts are on track \nto raise that figure to 1 million pounds by \nyear-end FY2022.Hybrid Crate Design  \nFor lighter product shipments, we have begun \nusing hybrid crates that pair a wooden base \nwith a corrugated kraft board top and full \nmoisture-barrier bagging inside. Offering a \n50% reduction in packaging weight, these \ndesigns save the equivalent of 3,917 trees \nannually, trim transport emissions and \npackaging material cost, ease recycling and \nincrease safety for freight handlers. \nReusable Packaging  \nIn 2021, we piloted a program that uses our \nLogistics T racking System to track packaging \nmaterials (wooden crates, metal fixtures), \ncollect them post-install from customer sites, \nand return them to the manufacturing location \nfor reuse. Beginning with a domestic loop from \nSingapore, we tested international loops in \nQ3 2021. We are also exploring a reusability \nprocess for our 500-pound pallets and for \ncrates from our contract manufacturers.Reusable Packaging Labels  \nLabels communicate to the end user that our  \npackaging is reusable and must not be discarded.\nWaste Reduction  \nT o keep our packaging out of landfills, \nApplied prohibits the use of non-recyclable \nmaterials such as Styrofoam. We also plan \nto restrict the use of non-recyclable and \nenvironmentally burdening materials such as \nPVC and toxic foams in the upcoming revision \nof Applied\u2019s Supplier Packaging Specification \ndue for release in FY22.\nPackaging ESG Dashboard  \nAn in-progress initiative is using existing \nSMS and SAP systems to develop \nmeasurement dashboards detailing our \npackaging\u2019s ESG impact. \nFlexible Solutions for Our \nPackaging Ecosystem\nHaving real-world impact on packaging waste requires real-world insight\u2014into \nhow much protection individual products need, where we are shipping them, and \nwhat the capacities are for recycling and reuse in those locations. Then, we design \nthe most resource-efficient packaging and processes to match.\nAt our TMC factory in T aiwan, we are eliminating some \npacking crates altogether by trucking products directly \nto our local customers.INTRODUCTION  \nPURPOSE \nPEOPLE \nPLANET \nPROGRESS\nDesign for  \nSustainability \nPromoting the  \nCircular Economy\nProduct Safety\nSupply Chain  \nResponsibility ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2021.pdf", "page": 78, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
