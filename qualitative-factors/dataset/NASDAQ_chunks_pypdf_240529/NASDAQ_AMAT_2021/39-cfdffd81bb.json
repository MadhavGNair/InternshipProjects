T argeted at the 400 members of \nour Applied Leadership Group (ALG), the \nworkshops achieved an 87% attendance  \nrate, including leadership from our Europe \nand Israel operations.\nFifteen of our U.S. leaders also participated \nin a pilot Coaching for Inclusion program \nthrough the Berkeley Executive Coaching \nInstitute. Building on previous diversity \ntraining that focused on gaining a deeper \nunderstanding of inclusion challenges and \nmaking inclusion personal, the Berkeley \nprogram is designed to give leaders the skills \nand tools to learn across difference to drive \nmeaningful, sustainable change. Its focus includes:\n > Building core capabilities and helping \nleaders develop an authentic leadership \npresence around DEI\n > Building empathy and an \nunderstanding of how DEI issues \naffect oneself and others\n > Becoming more conscious of how \npersonal behaviors can unintentionally \nreinforce unproductive dynamicsThe program is delivered via an initial two-\nday session, coaching, independent study, \nand a follow-up workshop. For 2022, we \nintend to take this program global, training \nthree cohorts of 21 leaders apiece, including \nin our Asia-Pacific operation.\nOur Inclusive Leader Action Guide, \nintroduced in the first half of 2021, \ncontinued to serve as a resource for our \nexecutive staff and people managers, \nproviding pragmatic strategies and best \npractices for becoming more inclusive \nleaders, partners, and change catalysts.These efforts build on changes introduced in \nprior years to help our leaders take Applied \nMaterials in the direction we need to go\u2014\nsuch as introducing diversity dashboards that \nallow U.S. leaders to track progress against \ndiversity goals for each organization, and \ntying executive compensation directly to the \nachievement of our diversity objectives via \nour Corporate Scorecard.\nOur COI progress is shared on a quarterly \nbasis with our Board of Directors.
