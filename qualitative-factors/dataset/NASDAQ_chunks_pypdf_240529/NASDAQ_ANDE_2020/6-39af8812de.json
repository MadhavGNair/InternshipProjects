We \nare able to make recommendations about \nwhere growers can increase or decrease \nthe amount of seed planted to match the field's potential productivity. Varying the \nplanting population allows growers to \ncalibrate the plant density to the potential \nproductivity of the field. \nPrecision agriculture enabled \nby technology will provide the \nability to increase food production \ncapacity to sustain a growing \npopulation in an increasingly \nresource-constrained environment.\nCERTIFICATIONS\nThe Andersons\u2019 facilities hold various \ncertifications based on the nature of \nthe products produced.
