We \ncould share with you only a small number of the many stories \nthat demonstrate our daily dedication to being a good corporate \nneighbor and doing the right thing for our customers, our \nemployees, our communities, our shareholders, and the world. \nWe hope to continue to be able to tell you more as each of \nour businesses does its part to feed the world and to be better \nevery day. In future updates, we anticipate addressing additional \nissues that impact our environment, our communities and the \nworld. The Andersons would not be the Company that it is today \nwithout the commitment to service which was embedded in \nthe Company by the Anderson family back in 1947. We remain \ngrounded in our history, but we look enthusiastically to the future.LOOKING \nFORWARD\nThe Andersons Corporate Headquarters, Maumee, Ohio\nThe Andersons, Inc.\n1947 Briarfield Boulevard\nMaumee, Ohio 43537\nwww.andersonsinc.com", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2020.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
