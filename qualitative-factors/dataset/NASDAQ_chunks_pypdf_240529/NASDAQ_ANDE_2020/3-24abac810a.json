{"page_content": "THE ANDERSONS, INC. SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW4Service is deeply embedded in the culture of \nThe Andersons. Harold Anderson founded \nThe Andersons with his wife, Margaret, and \nsix children in 1947 with the idea that they \ncould better serve area farmers by buying \ntheir grain at favorable prices while still selling \nit at a good profit. In the years that followed, \nthe Company began blending agricultural \nfertilizer, and it opened a warehouse market \nwhere farmers could shop for supplies while \nthey waited to unload their grain. Providing \nextraordinary service to both farmers and \nother end users is a Company hallmark that \nhas endured for more than 70 years.\nWhile customers are of paramount \nimportance, Harold also recognized \nthe importance of the Company\u2019s \nemployees to the enterprise. He \nbelieved that \u201cwork is a blessing,\u201d \nand he engendered a culture that \npromoted hard work toward both \npersonal and Company goals for fair \npay, all while enhancing rather than \ndetracting from healthy family life.\nHarold believed the Company had an \nimportant role to play in community life. \nFor many years, 10% of pretax income was \ngiven to local, nonprofit organizations. While \nthat percentage is lower today, that same \nspirit has the Company and several related \nfunds and foundations still generously \nsupporting the community, and employees are encouraged to share their time, talent and \ntreasure in pursuit of the common good. \nWhen Harold died in late 1968, the Company \nhad just begun to venture outside the \nmetropolitan Toledo area. In 1988, the \nCompany\u2019s partners, which by then included \n60 Anderson family members, dozens of \nemployees and five nonprofit organizations, \nformed a corporation which became the \npartnership\u2019s sole general partner. A new \nboard that included several Anderson family \nmembers and the Company\u2019s first independent \ndirectors governed the partnership. Harold\u2019s youngest son, Dick Anderson, took \nover leadership of the Company in 1984. \nDick helped shepherd the Company from \nprivate to public ownership, and he served as \npresident until 1996, CEO until 1999, chairman \nuntil 2009 and chairman emeritus until his \ndeath in March 2020. Like his father, he was \nboth an industry and community stalwart. \nHe strongly believed in service to others. An \navid woodworker, he carved the We Serve \nsculpture that stands in the front lobby of the \nCompany\u2019s headquarters.\nWE SERVE / OUR HISTORY\nHarold Anderson (left) and family", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2020.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
