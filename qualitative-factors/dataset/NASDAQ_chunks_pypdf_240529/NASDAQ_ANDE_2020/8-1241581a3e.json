When \ncases of COVID-19 began to appear in \nWashington state, The Andersons created \nan executive level team to monitor the \ncrisis, share information and best practices \nacross our operations, and manage our \nresponse to this crisis. The foundation for \nour response included the guidance of \nthe CDC, WHO, OSHA, and state and local \ngovernments, as well as benchmarking \nboth within our industries and with other \ncompanies throughout the U.S. On March \n13, over one week before the states of \nOhio and Kansas issued \u201cstay at home\u201d \norders, we elected to have employees at \nour main offices work remotely. \nDue to its importance to the North \nAmerican agricultural supply chain,\nThe Andersons is an essential business. \nEach facility carefully reviewed its \noperations to identify and mitigate risks \nsuch as physical distance, PPE when \nphysical distance was not possible, \ncleaning and use of common items such \nas tools and control panels, and common \nareas such as break rooms. Sites restricted \nvisitor and vendor access and developed \nnew, \u201clow contact\u201d protocols for necessary \ninteractions. A written facility virus control \npolicy and an easy-to-follow COVID-19 site \ncleaning plan PowerPoint were distributed \nto all business units. During the week of March 30, many sites prepared sanitation \nkits to ensure that they had the necessary \nPPE and cleaning supplies on hand. \nWe worked closely with customers to \nensure that their needs continued to be met. \nFor example, canned goods such as baked \nbeans were flying off grocery store shelves \nas consumer demand climbed sharply. \nCanning companies increased orders and \nneeded a record amount of shipments. The \nAndersons team worked tirelessly with the \nentire supply chain to double typical volume \nof cleaned processed edible beans to supply \nseveral baked bean canning companies.\nThe Company amended relevant policies, \nlike its sick leave policy and remote and \nflexible work policy, to accommodate \nemployee and public health needs during \nthe pandemic. The Company also issued a \ncomprehensive written crisis management \npolicy to ensure its ability to meet customer \nneeds during various crisis scenarios.PROVIDE EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS\nREGENERATIVE \nFOOD INGREDIENTS\nThe Andersons is able to work with \nCPG customers who wish to implement \nsustainable farming practices in their supply \nchain.

Our \nmulti-pillar approach allows us to manage \nmultiple segments of the supply chain and \noffer transparency to our customers. \nOur Trade and Plant Nutrient Groups have \nthe flexibility to collaborate and can offer \nboth upstream and downstream customers \na suite of products and services tailored \nto their needs.
