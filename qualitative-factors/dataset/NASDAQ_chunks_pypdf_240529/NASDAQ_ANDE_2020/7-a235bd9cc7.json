SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW8\nFeed Factors Limited, the Company\u2019s U.K. subsidiary, \nwon the West London Business Awards 2020 in the \ncategories of \u201cResponsible Supply Chain Company \nof the Year\u201d and \u201cClean Tech Company of the Year.\u201d  \nFeed Factors supplies organic and non-GMO agricultural \nproducts to the U.K. and European markets.4R NUTRIENT STEWARDSHIP\nThe Andersons has been and continues to \nbe an active participant and partner of the \n4R Nutrient Stewardship program. The 4R's \nprovide a fertilizer application framework \nfocused on using the Right Source of \nnutrients at the Right Rate, at the Right \nTime and in the Right Place, maximizing \ncrop uptake of nutrients while minimizing \nnutrient loss. The Andersons was part of \nthe committee who developed the program \ncriteria in early 2014 with the objective \nto create long-term positive impacts on \nwater bodies associated with agricultural \nproduction areas, to share the most up-to-\ndate information about responsible nutrient \nstewardship with dealers and growers, \nand to help the agriculture sector adapt to \nnew research and technology in the area \nof nutrient stewardship. The Company \nhas been focused not only on certifying our own farm \ncenter facilities, \nbut also worked \nas an advocate \nencouraging other \nretail customers \nobtain certification by assisting in training \nand offering financial support. The current \nprogram is directly focused on the Western \nLake Erie Basin (WLEB) but is actively \ngrowing to include Ontario, Indiana, Florida \nand Iowa. Audits are conducted annually \nwith a defined scope based on audit year, \nand a full audit scope of 45 different \nelements is completed every third year. \nCurrently, The Andersons has five \n4R certified retail farm centers and \nhas helped numerous external retail \ncustomers obtain 4R certification.PROVIDE EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS\nRESPONSIBLEAG\nThe Andersons has also been aligned and \nactive with the ResponsibleAg organization. \nResponsibleAg is an industry-led stewardship \norganization promoting public welfare by \nassisting agribusinesses as they seek to \ncomply with federal environmental, health, \nsafety and security rules. On April 17, 2013, \nthere was a large fertilizer explosion in \nWest, Texas, that killed 15 people, injured \n100 people and wiped out many homes \nbecause an independent ag dealer who was \nnot compliant with federal EHS regulations \nand had never been inspected by a third-\nparty. The incident cast a dark shadow over \nthe ag retailer industry, so the Ag Retailers \nAssociation (ARA) and The Fertilizer Institute \n(TFI) combined forces to be proactive by \neducating and auditing ag retailers to ensure \nthey are compliant with federal laws. \nThe Andersons was part of the \ncommittee that developed the first \nprogram checklist in late 2013. \nAudits are conducted every three years \nby a certified industry auditor on 17 \ndifferent topics and more than 400 \nrelated questions. Since that time, the \nCompany has continued to support our \nretail customers in \nunderstanding these \nrequirements, and we \ncurrently have four \nof our own certified \nfacilities.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANDE_2020.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
