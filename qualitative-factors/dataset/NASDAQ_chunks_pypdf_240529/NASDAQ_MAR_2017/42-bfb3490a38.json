One of our four priorities is to Welcome All and Advance Human Rights. By 2025, we have set a goal that 100 percent of associates will have completed \nour human rights training, including on human trafficking \nawareness, responsible sourcing and recruitment policies and practices. We have also set a 2025 Goal to enhance or embed human rights criteria in our recruitment and sourc-ing policies and work with our industry to address human \nrights risks in the hotel construction phase.\nOversight: Marriott\u2019s executive-level Human Rights  \nCouncil advances Marriott\u2019s human rights policies and programs including driving accountability and leading \nsuccessful execution of the company\u2019s  broad human rights \nstrategy.\nPolicies, Standards and Procedures: In addition to having \na human rights policy that extends to our overall business, Marriott includes human rights criteria and information \nwithin our Business Conduct Guide, Supplier Code of \nConduct, Supplier Sustainability Assessment, Quality Audit Property Certification Survey and ongoing risk management processes.Training: We train our associates on the company\u2019s  policies, including human rights and laws to protect  children. In 2016, we worked with external human  \ntrafficking experts ECPAT-USA and Polaris to develop and \ncomplete enhanced human trafficking training for hotel employees; translated the training into 15 languages; and donated the training to the American Hotel & Lodging \nAssociation for broader distribution within the hotel sector. \nWe leveraged Marriott\u2019s resources and influence to raise awareness of human trafficking internally with associates and externally with guests, consumers and local  communities.\nIncident Reporting: Marriott has also implemented  \nthe Marriott Incident Reporting Application (MIRA), which  is an online system for gathering and reporting  security-related incidents, including suspected human \ntrafficking for properties managed by Marriott. Our global \nmanaged properties are required to enter incidents into MIRA within 24 hours after the incident occurred or was reported. Critical incidents, such as human trafficking,  \nare flagged by the system for immediate follow-up with  \nlaw enforcement.\nAdditional information on polices, programs and  \nactivities can be found in Marriott\u2019s UK Human Trafficking Transparency Statement.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2017.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
