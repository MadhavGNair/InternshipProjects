{"page_content": "STRATEGY \nAND CLIMATE\nMGE is building a utility of the \nfuture, advancing clean energy and \nnew technologies for the benefit of \nall\u2014our customers, investors and \nbroader community. Through our \npartnerships and the application \nof science and technology, we are \nworking toward ambitious carbon \nreduction goals while fulfilling our \nmission to provide safe, reliable, \naffordable and sustainable energy  \nto our communities.Powering a more sustainable \nfuture\nIn May 2019, we announced a goal of net-\nzero carbon electricity by the year 2050. \nThis target is based on the latest climate \nscience. It is consistent with the work of \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) and its assessment of limiting \nglobal temperature increases to 1.5 degrees \nCelsius. Our 2050 goal reflects our vision \nand signals our direction, but it doesn't \ndetermine our pace. Every decision we \nmake is in the context of achieving deep \ndecarbonization as quickly as we can while \nfulfilling our obligation as a provider of safe, \nreliable, affordable and sustainable energy.\nAchieving net-zero by 2050 will require the \nuse of technologies not yet commercially \navailable or cost-effective, but we are well \non our way toward realizing our commitment \nto sustainability, to industry leadership and \nto those we serve.Energy 2030\nMGE already has reduced carbon emissions \n19% since 2005, our baseline. Under \nour Energy 2030 framework for a more \nsustainable future, introduced in November \n2015, we committed to reducing carbon \nemissions at least 40% by 2030. This  \ntarget is consistent with U.S. emissions \ntargets for the 2030 timeframe established \nas part of the landmark Paris Agreement on \nclimate change. \nEnergy 2030 also has a goal of 30% \nrenewable energy by 2030 and an interim \ngoal of 25% by 2025, which we expect \nto exceed by year-end 2021. We have \nsaid since establishing our goals that if we \ncan go further faster by working with our \ncustomers, we will.\nEnergy 2030 set our foundational \nobjectives for building your community \nenergy company for the future. It guides  \nour strategy and our work to:\u2022 Provide customers with options they \nwant today and in the future,\n\u2022 Help customers use energy efficiently \nand control future costs for all \ncustomers,\n\u2022 Transition MGE to a more \nenvironmentally sustainable  \nenergy supply,\n\u2022 Provide a dynamic electric grid that  \ncan integrate all energy technologies  \nto serve customers, and\n\u2022 Ensure that new and changing \ntechnology serves all customers \nequitably.\nClimate science partnership with the \nUniversity of Wisconsin\nTo inform our work for achieving deep \ndecarbonization and net-zero by 2050, \nMGE is working with scientists and experts \nat the University of Wisconsin-Madison's \nNelson Institute for Environmental Studies \nand the Department of Atmospheric  \nand Oceanic Sciences. The university  \nis providing expert input and perspective  \nto help evaluate our net-zero carbon goal \nin the context of the analyses done by the \nIPCC and helping to ensure our goal is \nconsistent with the IPCC assessment.MGE is committed to \nachieving net-zero carbon \nelectricity by 2050 for all \nthose we serve.\n10 9", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
