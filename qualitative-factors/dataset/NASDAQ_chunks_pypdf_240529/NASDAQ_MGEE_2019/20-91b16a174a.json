{"page_content": "Green Tier\nIn 2017, MGE expanded the scope of \nour renewed five-year contract with \nthe Wisconsin Department of Natural \nResources for Green Tier certification, \nwhich recognizes \nenvironmental leadership. \nOur primary goal in the \nexpanded contract is to \ncover all MGE operations \nunder our Environmental \nManagement System (EMS). An \nEMS is a continuous improvement \nprocess that evaluates, \nprioritizes and manages \nenvironmental risks.\nMGE previously used an EMS at our Blount \nGenerating Station. The expanded scope \nof our EMS will capture environmental Paint pilot\nMGE continues to use earth-friendly paint \noptions in place of aerosol cans that typically \nhave been used to mark underground gas \nand electric facilities. Aerosol cans push \nout the paint using a propellant, which is \noften hazardous. Aerosol cans also are \nunder pressure, which causes them to be \nconsidered hazardous waste even if the  \npaint in the can is not hazardous.\nSeveral years ago, MGE switched to a \nbagged paint technology, which offers \nseveral benefits, including:\n\u2022 Reduced waste. Once empty, the \npouched bags are biodegradable.\n\u2022 Increased safety. The pouches, which \nalso are less bulky, are not stored under \npressure.\nWe continue to research and test earth-\nfriendly painting options for marking our \ngas and electric underground facilities. \nWe currently are testing a steel can that is \ndesigned so it can be recycled when empty. \nEarly testing shows it is easier to use and has \na more consistent marking quality than the \nbagged paint technology.improvements across the company and \nfurther demonstrate our commitment \nto goal-setting and environmental \naccountability.\nBuilding and implementing an expanded \nEMS is a major undertaking that \nrequires a great deal of up-\nfront documentation. MGE's \nfirst Continuous Improvement \nSustainability Team is overseeing \nthe EMS expansion. The team is \nmaking progress on the required \ndocumentation for the EMS and \nhas identified an environmental \nrisk assessment process, which is \ndiscussed on page 54.Aluminum cans also are a higher-value \nrecyclable product than plastic bags. \nBecause recycling aluminum takes less \nenergy, the market for recycled aluminum \nremains consistently high, and aluminum can \nbe recycled repeatedly into new products \nwithout changing its elemental traits. We will \ncontinue to evaluate this new option from an \noperational and environmental perspective.\nBuy local\nLocal purchases support the local economy \nand are typically more environmentally \nfriendly. When it is time to purchase goods \nneeded to run our company, we review \nour supplier database and buy from local \nvendors when possible and cost-effective. \nMany of the materials and equipment that \nutilities need are highly specialized; however, \nwe buy U.S. products whenever possible.\nComprehensive risk minimization\nMGE has transitioned to a new software \nsystem for use in risk minimization. MGE's \nenvironmental team oversees hundreds \nof routine monitoring, record-keeping \nand reporting tasks, some of which occur every week. In the past, these were tracked \non multiple different servers to manage \nthe data and deadlines as the tasks were \nassigned to and tracked for employees \nacross several departments.\nIn 2019, MGE began using the new \nsoftware, which replaced all the old  \nservers and more, with one comprehensive \nEnvironmental Management Information \nSystem (EMIS). The new EMIS makes it \nsignificantly easier to see and track the \ndifferent tasks. For example, inspections \nin the field are now done and saved \nelectronically, which means the data  \ncan be retrieved instantly.\nThe new system provides MGE with \nbetter and quicker access to the status \nof compliance activities and improved \ninformation for resource planning. It also \nimproves our reporting performance. This \nleads to more efficient use of time, better \nalignment of information management \nprocesses and simplified training for \nturnover or responsibility transfers.\n In 2011, MGE stopped burning coal at our Blount Generating Station. This photo shows \ndeconstruction of a precipitator at Blount. A precipitator is an emissions control device that \ncaptures particulate matter from the exhaust gas. As part of the deconstruction project, we \ncreated a new nesting box for our resident peregrine falcons, which had been using a box on \ntop of the precipitator.\n40 39", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
