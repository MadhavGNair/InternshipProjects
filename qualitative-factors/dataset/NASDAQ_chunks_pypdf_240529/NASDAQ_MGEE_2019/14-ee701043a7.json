{"page_content": "SAFETY AND \nOPERATIONS\nSafety is a core value at MGE and is \nreflected in all our employees. When \nit comes to safety, every person and \nevery company can always improve \nupon their safety performance. That \nis why we embrace a philosophy of \ncontinuous improvement.We Power Safety\nIn 2014, MGE launched a corporate \nsafety commitment to improve our safety \nculture and begin MGE's journey to safety \nexcellence. Our Safety Steering Team \nmeets regularly to examine safety topics \nand to identify and to prioritize continuous \nimprovement opportunities.\nOur employees have taken the lead through \ntheir continuous improvement efforts to \nmake MGE a safer place to work. Our \nemployee-led Continuous Improvement \nTeams (CI Teams) are one example.\nOne of our employee-led CI Teams was \ntasked with developing a safety vision \nstatement. The team drafted a statement of \nsafety values that encompasses the business \nof MGE and creates a positive message that \nall MGE employees can adopt. This safety \nvision statement\u2014we power safety\u2014is \nhighly visible throughout our organization. \nIn 2018, four years into our safety journey, \nMGE achieved historic safety results. We recorded the lowest lost-time incident rate \nsince we started keeping records in 1971. We \nalso had our lowest total recordable incident \nrate since 1982 and second lowest since we \nstarted keeping records in 1971. In 2018, \nMGE employees worked more than one \nmillion hours without a lost-time incident.\nCrane operator training\nThe Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) recently developed \nnew safety rules requiring a new certification \nfor crane operators. MGE has a total of \nfive cranes that fall into three different \ncategories, requiring this certification for \nour operators.\nThe certification must be obtained  \nfrom an accredited, third-party crane \ncertification organization. In January 2019, \n12 MGE employees from various operations \ndepartments took both written and practical \ntests throughout a one-week course to \nreceive their certification. \nThe training was conducted at the MGE \nTraining Facility in Fitchburg, Wis. Before \nthe training could take place there, MGE \nfirst had to become an approved training \nfacility through the National Commission \nfor the Certification of Crane Operators.Continuous Improvement Teams\nSWAT and SPOT\nIn 2018, we had two CI Teams. The first, \nour Stop Work Authority Team (SWAT), \nstrengthened a \nprocess that gives \nall employees the \npower to stop \nwork and be safe. \nIt empowers and \nprovides employees with the responsibility \nand obligation to stop work when a real or \nperceived unsafe condition or behavior may \nresult in an unwanted event.\nOur Safety Proactive Observation Team \n(SPOT), the second 2018 CI Team, \ndesigned a process \nthat provides \nemployees with \npositive recognition \nand reinforcement \nof positive \nbehaviors. The process is designed to help \nshowcase the good work practices that \noccur on a daily basis across MGE and  \nto reinforce positive safety behaviors.Twelve MGE employees from  \nvarious operations departments  \ntook both written and practical  \ntests throughout a one-week course \nto receive their OSHA certification \nfor crane operators. \n28 27", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
