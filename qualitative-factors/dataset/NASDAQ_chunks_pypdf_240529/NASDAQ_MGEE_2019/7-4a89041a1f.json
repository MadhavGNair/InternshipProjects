{"page_content": "Harnessing methane\nMGE continues to reduce greenhouse \ngas (GHG) impacts with an initiative that \ngenerates electricity from the combustion \nof methane, which is produced locally by \ncow manure. As a GHG, methane is at least \n25 times more potent than carbon; however, \nmethane as a fuel burns much cleaner and \nproduces 50% less GHGs than coal.\nMGE receives energy from a manure \ndigester. The digester converts cow manure \nfrom local farms into electricity. For 2018, \nthe manure digester generated more than \n11.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, \nwhich is enough to power nearly 2,000 \nhouseholds.\nUnder an Environmental Protection Agency \nrequirement, MGE monitors, measures and \nreports several GHG emissions annually. \nMGE tracking covers power plant emissions, \nnatural gas distribution and smaller \ncombustion sources.\nRight: Renewable biomass energy from \na manure digester is added to MGE's \ncommunity grid as part of our overall energy \nmix. The biodigester, which came online at \nthe end of 2013, helps to reduce phosphorus \nrunoff into local waterways and improve  \nwater quality.0.33 lb/MWh\n414.0 tons1.629 lb/kWh\n2.91 million tons\n0.71 lb/MWh\n886.5 tons\n0.05 lb/MWh\n63 tonsCO\u2082\nNO x\nSO\u2082\nPM\nHG\nCO\u2082NOx0.0000046 lb/MWh\n11.5 lbs\n01\n0\n1.5.2\n.86 All-electric\n    vehicles\nAll-electric\nvehicles6 Electric hybrid\n    bucket trucks\nElectric hybrid\nbucket trucks\nPercentage decrease since 20052018 emissions\n2018 recycling numbersMGE EV/hybrid \ufb02eet\nMGE EV/hybrid \ufb02eetPeregrine timeline\n22 Gas/electric\n      hybrid vehicles \nGas/electric\nhybrid vehicles \n19 69PM\n91HG\n92SO\u2082\n97The use of the pesticide \nDDT begins during \nWorld War II.\nThe peregrine population \ncontinues to decline; there \nare no peregrines in\nthe eastern U.S.\nWisconsin bans the use of DDT.\nThe Environmental Protection \nAgency bans the use of DDT.\nThe American peregrine falcon \nis listed as endangered under the \nEndangered Species Act.\nMGE installs its falcon nesting \nbox at Blount Generating Station.\nThe peregrine falcon is \ndeclassi\ufb01ed as a federally \nendangered species.\nA pair of falcons begins using\nMGE's nesting box, hatching \nthree chicks named Steve, \nGenny and Cole.\nThree falcon chicks hatch in\nMGE's nesting box, bringing the \ntotal to 42 chicks since 2009.1940s\n1960s\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1999\n2009\n2019\n514UPOT\nMetal\n161UPOT\nAll-in-one\no\ufb03ce recycling\n0.50\nUPOT\nAkaline batteries\n3.98UPOT\nPaper\n4.79UPOT\nE-waste\n52.8UPOT\nWood pallets66220.33 lb/MWh\n414.0 tons1.629 lb/kWh\n2.91 million tons\n0.71 lb/MWh\n886.5 tons\n0.05 lb/MWh\n63 tonsCO\u2082\nNO x\nSO\u2082\nPM\nHG\nCO\u2082NOx0.0000046 lb/MWh\n11.5 lbs\n01\n0\n1.5.2\n.86 All-electric\n    vehicles\nAll-electric\nvehicles6 Electric hybrid\n    bucket trucks\nElectric hybrid\nbucket trucks\nPercentage decrease since 20052018 emissions\n2018 recycling numbersMGE EV/hybrid \ufb02eet\nMGE EV/hybrid \ufb02eetPeregrine timeline\n22 Gas/electric\n      hybrid vehicles \nGas/electric\nhybrid vehicles \n19 69PM\n91HG\n92SO\u2082\n97The use of the pesticide \nDDT begins during \nWorld War II.\nThe peregrine population \ncontinues to decline; there \nare no peregrines in\nthe eastern U.S.\nWisconsin bans the use of DDT.\nThe Environmental Protection \nAgency bans the use of DDT.\nThe American peregrine falcon \nis listed as endangered under the \nEndangered Species Act.\nMGE installs its falcon nesting \nbox at Blount Generating Station.\nThe peregrine falcon is \ndeclassi\ufb01ed as a federally \nendangered species.\nA pair of falcons begins using\nMGE's nesting box, hatching \nthree chicks named Steve, \nGenny and Cole.\nThree falcon chicks hatch in\nMGE's nesting box, bringing the \ntotal to 42 chicks since 2009.1940s\n1960s\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1999\n2009\n2019\n514UPOT\nMetal\n161UPOT\nAll-in-one\no\ufb03ce recycling\n0.50\nUPOT\nAkaline batteries\n3.98UPOT\nPaper\n4.79UPOT\nE-waste\n52.8UPOT\nWood pallets6622EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are calculated from \ngenerating units owned by MGE, power purchase \nagreements and power purchased by MGE on the regional \nMidcontinent Independent System Operator market. The \nmarket purchase emission rate is based on a seven-state \nregional average CO2 emission profile from all power \nproduced in Wisconsin and the surrounding Midwest states.\nNitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter (PM), mercury \n(Hg) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission rates are calculated \nfrom MGE-owned generation assets, including MGE's \nshare of jointly owned units. MGE is part owner of the \nColumbia Energy Center, Elm Road Generating Station, \nWest Campus Cogeneration Facility and the Forward \nEnergy Center.Reducing emissions, improving  \nair quality\nFor the past 15 years, we have made \nstrides to reduce air emissions by installing \nnew emission reduction equipment and \nimproving equipment efficiencies with our \ncurrent generation fleet. As we work toward \nour ambitious goal of net-zero carbon \nelectricity by 2050, we have continued  \nto make significant investments in local  \nand regional renewable generation. \nWe also purchase power through contracts \nand from the Midcontinent Independent \nSystem Operator market.\nWe continue to transition to cost-effective, \nclean energy while also working with \ncustomers on energy efficiency and \nconservation efforts to reach our carbon \nreduction goals.\nEnsuring that new and changing technology \nserves all customers equitably is one of our \nkey objectives under our Energy 2030 \nframework. We are working to build a \nsmarter, cleaner community grid that  \nserves to benefit all customers.\nThe graphic at right shows emission rate \ndecreases since 2005 for carbon dioxide  \nand regulated air emissions.\n14 13", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
