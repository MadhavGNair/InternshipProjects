{"page_content": "Collaborating to advance \nsustainability and innovation \nBy working together with our customers and \nother stakeholders, we can develop solutions \nto the energy challenges of our times and \nreach our shared energy goals. For example, \nMGE is a partner in the Midcontinent \nPower Sector Collaborative (MPSC) \nfacilitated by the Great Plains Institute \n(GPI) out of Minneapolis, Minn. \nThe MPSC, consisting of utilities, agencies, \nnon-governmental organizations and \nenvironmental groups, worked together to \ndevelop the Road Map to Decarbonization \nin the Midcontinent: Electricity Sector. \nMGE's local partners in the MPSC include \nthe nonprofit Clean Wisconsin and the \nDane County Office of Energy and  \nClimate Change. \nThe MPSC brings together diverse \nviewpoints and priorities to develop  \noptions to continue driving toward a \nlower carbon future and better inform \npolicymakers. The MPSC is one of many \npartnerships in which MGE is involved to \nfurther sustainable energy.Partnering with Lyft \nOne of our newest partnerships is with  \nLyft, the ridesharing company. MGE is \npartnering with Lyft to increase the use  \nof EV ridesharing in the Madison area and  \nto grow awareness of the benefits of EVs. \nThe two companies are offering a $500 \nbonus to Madison-area EV drivers who  \nsign up to drive with Lyft. \nWorking with regional stakeholders \nAs part of the Great Plains Institute's \nMidcontinent Transportation Electrification \nCollaborative (M-TEC), we're working \nwith other utilities, state governments, \nautomakers, EV charging companies and \nenvironmental groups to advance EV \ninfrastructure and increase use of EVs. \nWorking together, our group conducts \nresearch, develops white papers and policy \nrecommendations, and hosts workshops  \nfor stakeholders in the region.\nResources and tools to educate drivers\nMGE helps to educate customers, \nbusinesses and our community at-large \nabout the benefits of EVs. Our experts are \non hand at many community events with our \nall-electric Chevy Bolt to share information \non driving and charging EVs. The Road Map identified that \"a \nsubstantially decarbonized electricity  \nsector is expected to grow and to enable  \nthe decarbonization of other sectors  \nthrough efficiency and electrification.\"\nWe also partner to grow innovation. For \nexample, MGE Energy is an investor and \nsupporter of Energy Impact Partners \n(EIP), a utility-focused investment fund. \nEIP brings together capital and industry \nexpertise to grow early-stage companies, \nsuch as Sense Labs.\nMGE partnered with a number of residential \ncustomers to explore Sense Labs' home \nenergy monitor. The monitor attaches \nto a residential electric panel to develop \n\"profiles\" of devices in the home that use \nelectricity. An app gives customers access By \"meeting customers where they are,\" \nwe are able to connect customers to \nnew technologies, such as EVs, and work \ntogether to advance sustainability and new \ntechnologies with all customers. \nFor example, in 2018, MGE and the \nMadison Area Chinese Community \nOrganization (MACCO) \npartnered to host a \"kick the \ntires\" event featuring several \nEVs. MACCO helped to \ntranslate MGE's EV-related \ninformation into Chinese \nahead of the event, which was held by one \nof MGE's DC fast charging stations. MGE \nregularly hosts \"kick the tires\" events in to their household energy use information, \nequipping them with real-time data to help \nmanage their use.\nTechnical Work Group\nMGE continues to work with the Citizens \nUtility Board and Clean Wisconsin as a \nTechnical Work Group, examining innovative \nprogram ideas in a focused, deliberative \nfashion. The work group, which began in \n2014, seeks to identify ways that MGE can \nbe responsive to our customers' evolving \nenergy needs while ensuring a modern, \nsustainable electric system. Some of  \nMGE's pilot programs, such as Shared Solar, \nOn Demand Savings, smart thermostat \ndemand response (MGE Connect) and \nCharge@Home, have been informed by  \nthe group's efforts.neighborhoods throughout our community \nto engage customers directly. \nIn 2018, MGE launched our LovEV website \nto help customers discover why \"there's a \nlot to love\" about EVs. LovEV highlights \navailable models, explains charging options, \nand details cost and environmental savings.  \nIt is an easy, one-stop online \nresource at mge.com/LovEV.\nThe online tool, Explore My EV, \ngives users the opportunity  \nto compare the costs of plug-in \nhybrid and all-electric vehicles to gasoline-\npowered models. The tool, available  \nat mge.com/exploremyev, considers  \ncommute distances, available tax credits  \nand maintenance costs, among other  \nthings when doing its online analysis. \n24 23", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
