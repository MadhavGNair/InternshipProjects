{"page_content": "Resource planning and carbon regulation\nWhen making generation decisions, MGE \nengages in extensive resource planning \nanalysis and modeling, which consider \nmany factors including forecasted energy \nuse projections; long-term impacts on \ncustomers, investors and the environment; \npotential future environmental regulations; \nassumptions related to the anticipated costs \nof fuel and many other factors related to \nenergy production. Our economic analysis \nexplicitly includes a possible projected \ncarbon surcharge to help ensure our \ndecisions are financially sound\u2014regardless \nof whether or how carbon is regulated in  \nthe future. \nIn addition, large new generating facilities \nare reviewed by the Public Service \nCommission of Wisconsin to ensure the \nproject is in the public interest. For larger \nprojects, different generating scenarios \nare modeled in our regulatory application \nto demonstrate the need and to justify the \ncost. All proposals and decisions by the state \nregulatory body are part of the public record.Our strategies for deep decarbonization\nThe U.S. Mid-Century Strategy (MCS) for \nDeep Decarbonization is the United States' \nstrategy for meeting the goals of the Paris \nAgreement on climate change to limit global \nwarming. Both the MCS and the IPCC rely \non decarbonizing electric generation, using \nenergy efficiently and electrifying other \nenergy uses, including transportation.  \nThese are the strategies MGE is pursuing \nand will continue to pursue to achieve  \ndeep decarbonization and net-zero  \ncarbon electricity.\nGrowing our use \nof clean energy\nSince announcing our \nEnergy 2030 framework \nin November 2015, we have developed \nprojects that will increase our owned \nrenewable capacity by roughly 600%. \nGrowing our use of renewable resources is \na part of our strategy for achieving net-zero \ncarbon electricity by 2050.Our recent clean energy projects include:\n\u2022 Building our 66-megawatt (MW) \nSaratoga Wind Farm in Iowa. Our \nlargest and most efficient wind farm, \nSaratoga came online in early 2019  \nto serve 47,000 households. \n\u2022 Purchasing a 16-MW share of the \nForward Energy Center wind farm  \nin Wisconsin in 2018.\n\u2022 Expanding our highly successful \ncommunity solar program, Shared \nSolar, with a 5-MW solar array in  \nour service territory, expected online  \nin 2020. \n\u2022 Purchasing 100 MW of solar capacity \nfrom the Badger Hollow Solar Farm \nin Iowa County, Wis. Badger Hollow is \nexpected to provide 50 MW by the end \nof 2020; another 50 MW, if approved, \nis expected online by the end of 2021.\n\u2022 Purchasing 50 MW of solar capacity \nfrom the Two Creeks Solar project, \nexpected online by the end of 2020.Our mix of resources includes:\nBadger Hollow Solar Farm, Iowa County \n(Expected online in 2020, 2021).\nBlount Generating Station, Madison.\nColumbia Energy Center, Portage.\nCombustion turbines, Madison and \nMarinette.\nDane County Airport Solar, Madison \n(Proposed).\nElm Road Generating Station, Oak Creek.\nForward Energy Center wind farm, Dodge \nand Fond du Lac counties.\nRosiere Wind Farm, Kewaunee County.\nSaratoga Wind Farm, Howard County, \nIowa. \nMorey Field Solar, Middleton Municipal \nAirport (Expected online in 2020).\nShared Solar, Middleton Operations \nCenter.\nSolar photovoltaic units, Dane County.\nTop of Iowa Wind Farm, Worth County, \nIowa.\nTwo Creeks Solar, Manitowoc County \n(Expected online in 2020).\nWest Campus Cogeneration Facility, \nMadison.Ongoing transition from fossil fuels\nMGE has no controlling interest in coal-\nfired resources and announced several \nyears ago that we would not be investing \nfurther in coal-fired plants. In 2011, MGE \ndiscontinued the use of coal at the only \ngenerating facility in which we have sole \nownership, our Blount Generating Station.\nIn 2016, we reduced our minority ownership \nin the Columbia Energy Center. MGE \nreached an agreement with the plant's  \nco-owners to reduce our MW capacity \nshare by about 14%. \nAdditionally, as part of a rate case \nsettlement agreement in 2018, MGE \naccelerated the depreciation of certain \nassets, including our combustion turbines, \nBlount Generating Station and Columbia \nEnergy Center Unit 1. The accelerated \ndepreciation schedule will help the company \nmove forward with investments in cleaner \nsources of energy.increase in \nowned renewable\ncapacity600%\nRight: MGE's Jeff Keebler (center) joined  \nWEC Energy Group and its subsidiary,  \nWisconsin Public Service, in August  \n2019 for a groundbreaking of the  \nTwo Creeks Solar project.\n12 11", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
