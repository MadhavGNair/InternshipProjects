{"page_content": "department hosts an Energy Marketplace \nUpdate session for interested employees. \nThe one-hour events provide seasonal \nupdates on what is happening in the energy \nmarketplace. They examine the current \nsupply/demand fundamentals and how those \nmay impact energy prices.\nCustomer engagement\nAs your community energy company, we \nseek to engage all our customers in many \ndifferent ways. MGE values the diversity of \nperspectives across our service territory. \nWe are committed to deepening our \nengagement efforts to reach shared energy \ngoals and to improve the health and vitality \nof our community.\nSupporting our neighborhoods \nVibrant neighborhoods\u2013and the active \nneighborhood associations that serve \nthem\u2013contribute to the quality of life in \nour community. Throughout the Madison \narea, festivals and community activities \nlike concerts, picnics and potlucks help \nneighborhood associations raise funds \nfor important local projects and provide \ncommunity-driven, family-friendly activities.products we eat make it to our tables. One \nout of every three bites of food we eat is \nbecause of pollinators. \nPollinating animals travel from plant to \nplant carrying pollen on their bodies in a \nvital interaction that allows plants to create \nfruit, nuts and other edible parts. The vast \nmajority of pollinators in the United States \nare insects such as bees, butterflies, moths, \nbeetles and even some wasps. Other \npollinators include birds, bats and other \nsmall mammals.\nSupport for pollinator habitat\nUtilities are in a unique position to help \nsupport pollinator habitat. They can protect \nexisting habitat and create new habitat  \nalong rights-of-way and on other owned \nfacilities. MGE's large-scale solar projects  \nin development will host pollinator habitat. \nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is \ncurrently working with utilities to draft \nconservation agreements to protect the \nmonarch butterfly. These conservation \nagreements would help the monarch and \nother pollinator species while allowing \nutilities to continue to maintain and  \nupgrade their facilities.We are exploring how a conservation \nagreement might fit at MGE. We already \nactively protect the rusty patched bumble \nbee by supporting the replacement of \nhabitat when we install and maintain our \nelectric and gas lines.\nNational Pollinator Week at MGE\nMGE employees helped celebrate National \nPollinator Week by planting wildflowers in \ntwo flower beds at our downtown Madison \ncampus. We worked with the University \nof Wisconsin-Extension to plant native \nwildflowers that will help attract bees, \nbutterflies and other beneficial insects.\nAt a pollinator open house, employees had \na chance to win a mason bee home built by \none of their coworkers, get gardening tips, \nsee and learn about a monarch caterpillar \nand take home some butterfly weed seeds. \nButterfly weed plants provide critical habitat \nfor monarch butterflies.The buzz about mason bees\nMason bees have pollinator power with a \n95% pollination rate versus a 5% pollination \nrate for honeybees. Mason bees are very \nsolitary and do not live in hives or swarm. \nCompared to other bees, mason bees \nrarely sting, making them a great addition \nto garden areas. MGE will have two mason \nbee homes near the wildflower pollinator \ngardens planted by employees.\nEmployee engagement  \nand development\nThe energy world is ever-changing.  \nWe believe it is important to engage our \nemployees as our industry evolves. MGE \nis committed to sustainable workforce \npractices such as career development  \nand training.Professional development opportunities\nMGE offers all employees the opportunity \nto learn and grow\u2013whether it is to become \nmore proficient in their job, improve \ndecision-making skills or prepare for a move \nto another role. Our employees have the \ntools available to develop the knowledge and \nskills necessary to grow and to be successful.\nThe Learning Center is an online resource \navailable to all MGE employees. Launched \nin 2017, this cloud-based tool contains a \nvast library of courses for online learning.  \nIt recommends training courses for \nemployees based on the courses they've \nalready taken and subjects in which they \nhave shown interest, and it provides a \ntranscript of courses they have taken in \nThe Learning Center as well as corporate \ntraining they attend.\nThe Learning Center is constantly updated \nwith courses relevant to MGE employees. \nThis helps ensure employees are equipped \nwith the knowledge and skills to effectively \nnavigate our changing industry.Informational sessions for employees\nInformational brown bags, or lunch-and-\nlearn types of sessions, are one of the ways \nMGE employees are informed of industry \ntrends and changes and the impacts these \nmay have on MGE.\nThree to four times a year, members  \nof MGE's executive team host informal \nemployee discussion sessions. These \n\"brown bag\" sessions are designed for the \nexecutive management to provide company \nand industry updates to employees and \nto answer employee questions on topics \nrelating to the business or industry. These \nsessions also provide the executives with \nan opportunity to ask employees questions \nabout their experiences and get direct \ninsights into issues facing the company and \nindustry. These engagement opportunities \nare held in multiple locations with employees \nin both our corporate office and field \nreporting sites.\nOther informational sessions for employees \ntake place throughout the year on a variety \nof topics, often organized by different \ndepartments.
