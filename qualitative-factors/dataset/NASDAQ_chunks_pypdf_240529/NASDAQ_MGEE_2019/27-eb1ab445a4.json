In 2017, MGE expanded the scope \nof its renewed five-year contract with the \nWisconsin Department of Natural Resources \nfor its Green Tier certification, which recognizes \nenvironmental leadership. Our primary goal \nin the expanded contract is to cover all MGE \noperations under our EMS. \nOur independent third-party's expertise in risk \nmanagement and compliance is helping MGE \nto identify operational and environmental risks \nand to evaluate those risks under the scope of \nour expanded EMS. This further demonstrates \nour commitment to goal-setting and to \nenvironmental accountability. \nMGE operates within a culture of sustainability \nand risk management, which is brought to \nthe entire board. All officers of the company \ntake ownership in and are accountable for \nmanaging and mitigating corporate risk. Our \ncomprehensive approach encourages all our \ndirectors to initiate discussion at any time, \neither directly or through our Lead Independent \nDirector, on any areas of concern, including \nrisk identification and assessment, controls, \nmanagement and oversight. Effective oversight \nDirectors understand sustainability is \nintegral to the company's long-term  \nsuccess and share management's \ncommitments in these areas, from long-\nterm and strategic direction to day-to-day \nbusiness practices companywide. Their \noversight includes review of environmental \nrisks and mitigation as well as assessment \nof current and/or future environmental \nregulations. It also includes review of the \ncompany's environmental and sustainability \nperformance. \nIn 2018, MGE moved from biennial to \nannual production of our Environmental  \nand Sustainability Report. This report is \nreviewed by the board every year.\nExecutive compensation \nMGE Energy's Board of Directors' \ncompensation committee, composed \nof independent directors, takes into \nconsideration environmental performance, \namong other factors such as cost \ncontainment and management of day-\nto-day operations, when evaluating \nexecutive compensation. The committee \nalso considers other performance goals, \nsuch as earnings, system reliability and customer satisfaction as well as long-term \nstrategic goals, including those related to \nsustainability.\nAs part of its ongoing assessment of \ncorporate performance, the board of \ndirectors regularly reviews how well the \ncompany is advancing its overall goals  \naround carbon emission reductions as well  \nas progress on its specific strategies for  \ndeep decarbonization.\nState and federal oversight\nAs a public utility, MGE operates under \nstate and federal regulations.
