{"page_content": "Storm Response Plan\nMGE takes seriously the risk from severe \nweather. We have a companywide Storm \nResponse Plan (SRP), which serves as our \nguide or framework for rapid, effective \nresponse to emergencies caused by extreme \nweather events.\nThe Incident Commander leads the SRP \nfunctions and is supported by Section \nChiefs who are responsible for running the \nmajor functional sections within the SRP. \nSome of those functions include assessing \ndamage, ordering supplies and managing \nmutual assistance crews from other \nutilities as well as responding to media and \ncustomers experiencing an outage or other \nservice-related issues from the event.Successful joint response to storm  \nand flood\nIn August 2018, record amounts of rain \nfell across MGE's service territory, causing \nunprecedented flooding and a joint storm \nresponse from MGE gas and electric \ncrews. Typically, our storm response efforts \nfocus entirely on electric restoration. This \nstorm's subsequent flooding prompted a \nmore collaborative storm response effort from both Electric and Gas Operations and \nothers across the organization, including \nFacilities Management. \nThe threat of flooding in downtown Madison \nalso meant MGE incident command staff \nkept in close communication with City and \nCounty officials to prepare to respond to a \nprolonged flood event. MGE infrastructure \ndid not suffer any serious issues. \nAll hazards response\nWhether it's a natural disaster or a man-\nmade disaster, such as a cyberattack, \nMGE has plans in place to prevent and \nmitigate damage. Having a well-defined \nand practiced All Hazards Response Plan \nis critical to managing and responding \nappropriately to an emergency situation. \nMGE's All Hazards Response Plan \nencompasses everything from storm \nresponse to cyberattacks.\n32 31", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
