{"page_content": "Bottle filling stations and filtration \nsystems\nThroughout our facilities, MGE has 16 water \nbottle filling stations and filtration systems for \nemployees to reduce the use of plastic bottles. \nIn the seven years since the first one was \ninstalled, MGE employees have avoided using \nmore than 488,000  disposable plastic bottles.\nEliminating waste with E-records\nMGE's E-records Center allows employees \nto submit electronic documents to be stored \nas records rather than keeping paper copies. \nOver time, this will reduce our volume of \npaper. This environmentally friendly option \nalso frees up physical storage space. Protecting our natural resources\nMGE takes steps to protect our natural \nresources. This means doing our part to help \nimprove waterways, preserve the natural \nbeauty of our communities and protect \nwildlife habitats. \nStormwater management\nPollutants transported in stormwater \nare harmful to lakes, rivers, wetlands and \nwaterways. MGE implements measures \nto protect our water bodies. For example, \nMGE's downtown parking lot has a \nstormwater filtration system. This system \ncleans stormwater before it drains into \nnearby Lake Monona. This system is \neffective in reducing pollutants such  \nas petroleum compounds, sediment  \nand phosphorus.\nErosion control\nWe are committed to implementing proper \nerosion-control methods at all work sites. \nThis minimizes the likelihood of soil being \nwashed out of a site. We track permits and \ninspections and have a committee that \nreviews new regulations, field techniques \nand technologies to ensure we effectively \nmanage our erosion-control strategies.Paperless billing\nMGE launched My Bill Pay, our new and \nimproved paperless billing and online \npayment system, for \ncustomers in 2016. \nOnline billing and \npayment is a \"win-\nwin\" for customers \nand companies. \nStudies find customers \nare more satisfied when \nviewing and paying their \nbills electronically. Companies benefit by \nrealizing paper and postage savings from not \nhaving to print and mail paper bills.\nIn July 2019, MGE hit 42% paperless  \nbilling adoption by customers, resulting in  \nan estimated annualized savings of more  \nthan $300,000. It also means more than \n1.3 million bill pages are not printed each \nyear, which saves:\n\u2022 More than 2,600 reams of paper  \nper year.\n\u2022 More than 13,000 pounds, or six  \nand a half tons, of paper per year.Invasive species\nInvasive species and non-native plants \nadversely affect areas where they spread. \nThey also may pose a risk to human health. \nInvasive species can be found in forests, \ngrasslands, wetlands, lakes and rivers.\nMGE's Electric and Gas Operations \nemployees are trained on how to identify \ninvasive species in MGE's service area, plan \nwork around them, avoid contact and follow \nprocedures for post-work cleanup.\nDuring a recent gas project near Black  \nEarth Creek, MGE crews thought they  \nmay have encountered a New Zealand \nmudsnail, an invasive snail. The project \nsupervisor stopped work, took a picture  \nof the snail with a nickel by it for scale  \nand sent the photo to a member of MGE's Supply Chain and Waste \nManagement\nSuccessful waste management requires a \nsolid recycling program. We encourage \nemployees to make smart choices \nabout the environment. That includes \nsupporting our recycling and waste- \nreduction efforts every day. We work \nto conserve, recycle and manage \nwaste efficiently.\nReduce-reuse-recycle\nOur all-in-one recycling method includes \npaper products, glass, plastic and aluminum. \nWe also recycle various metals and other \nscrap materials left over from field work. \nOur computing equipment and supplies are \nsent to an e-Stewards certified company for \nrecycling or reuse, and our alkaline batteries \ngo to a vendor who recovers steel and zinc. \nAdditionally, a local vendor takes our wood \npallets, recycling them into mulch.\nWe also recycle thermostats and other \nmercury-containing devices, chemicals, \nsteel, iron, copper, glass and cell phones.Environmental Affairs team. The photo then \nwas shared with an invasive species expert \nat the Wisconsin Department of Natural \nResources. Within 10 minutes of the photo \nbeing taken on-site, it was determined that \nit was a native snail and work was able to \nresume.\nThe combination of interdepartmental \ncoordination and formal systems helps \nMGE stay in compliance, minimize impacts \nand avoid project shutdowns.\nSolar powers corporate office\nNearly 450 solar panels on our corporate \noffice in Madison, Wis., generate about  \n10% of the energy needed annually to power \nthe facility. The array, along with 52 panels \nin our visitor parking lot, represent another \nstep in our ongoing path toward greater \nsustainability throughout our operations.\nIn addition, MGE's 2,000-square-foot \noffice building in Prairie du Chien, Wis., also \nhas 20 solar panels on the roof capable of \nproducing about 5.3 kW of energy.\nThis photo helped an MGE gas crew  \ndetermine if they had encountered an  \ninvasive species of snail.\n38 37", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
