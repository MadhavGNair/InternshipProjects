{"page_content": "EV engagement at MGE\nMGE seeks to engage our employees in  \nour efforts to grow the use of EVs. We  \noffer five workplace charging stations,  \neach with dual ports, to enable charging  \nfor employees while at work. Workplace \ncharging offers many benefits, including \nemployee attraction and retention, and \nsupport for sustainable initiatives.\nMGE's EV fleet by the numbers \nWe have been testing commercially  \navailable fleet operations EVs for more  \nthan a decade. We are continuing to  \nadd all-electric or hybrid vehicles to our  \nfleet, where possible. Our fleet includes a \nplug-in electric pickup truck, hybrid step \nvan, hybrid bucket trucks and two all-electric \nChevy Bolts. Electric buses coming to Madison\nIn 2020, three all-electric buses will \nbecome part of the City of Madison's \nMetro Transit (Metro) fleet. MGE worked \nwith Metro to secure a $1.3 million federal \ngrant for the zero-emission buses. MGE is \npartnering with the City of Madison to help \nelectrify its bus fleet by 2030. \nAs part of the ongoing collaboration,  \nMGE is providing:\n\u2022 100% of the required local matching \nfunds for charging infrastructure for  \nthe three buses.\n\u2022 Continued in-kind support and \nexpertise to address technological \nissues and facilitate cost-effective  \nand efficient use of energy.Zero-emission buses will play a key role \nin efforts to reduce carbon emissions. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, for every zero-emission bus \non the road, carbon emissions are reduced \nby nearly 1,700 tons over their estimated \n12-year life span. With three electric \nbuses, that would be an estimated carbon \nreduction of 5,100 tons. MGE continues  \nto work with the City to seek ways to further \nthe electrification of transportation.0.33 lb/MWh\n414.0 tons1.629 lb/kWh\n2.91 million tons\n0.71 lb/MWh\n886.5 tons\n0.05 lb/MWh\n63 tonsCO\u2082\nNO x\nSO\u2082\nPM\nHG\nCO\u2082NOx0.0000046 lb/MWh\n11.5 lbs\n01\n0\n1.5.2\n.86 All-electric\n    vehicles\nAll-electric\nvehicles6 Electric hybrid\n    bucket trucks\nElectric hybrid\nbucket trucks\nPercentage decrease since 20052018 emissions\n2018 recycling numbersMGE EV/hybrid \ufb02eet\nMGE EV/hybrid \ufb02eetPeregrine timeline\n22 Gas/electric\n      hybrid vehicles \nGas/electric\nhybrid vehicles \n19 69PM\n91HG\n92SO\u2082\n97The use of the pesticide \nDDT begins during \nWorld War II.\nThe peregrine population \ncontinues to decline; there \nare no peregrines in\nthe eastern U.S.\nWisconsin bans the use of DDT.\nThe Environmental Protection \nAgency bans the use of DDT.\nThe American peregrine falcon \nis listed as endangered under the \nEndangered Species Act.\nMGE installs its falcon nesting \nbox at Blount Generating Station.\nThe peregrine falcon is \ndeclassi\ufb01ed as a federally \nendangered species.\nA pair of falcons begins using\nMGE's nesting box, hatching \nthree chicks named Steve, \nGenny and Cole.\nThree falcon chicks hatch in\nMGE's nesting box, bringing the \ntotal to 42 chicks since 2009.1940s\n1960s\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1999\n2009\n2019\n514UPOT\nMetal\n161UPOT\nAll-in-one\no\ufb03ce recycling\n0.50\nUPOT\nAkaline batteries\n3.98UPOT\nPaper\n4.79UPOT\nE-waste\n52.8UPOT\nWood pallets6622\n22 21", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
