The \nsustainability program for local businesses \nrecently celebrated 10 years, tallying \nmore than 500 sustainability projects in \nits history. The projects include energy \nefficiency, waste reduction, renewable \nenergy purchases and production, and \nalternative transportation, among others. \nSustain Dane estimates that these projects \nhave resulted in 19.2 million kWh conserved, \n60.3 million pounds of CO2 avoided and \n$2.1 million saved each year. Advancing energy efficiency  \nand conservation \nEnergy efficiency is a key strategy for \nreducing carbon emissions and for reaching \nour energy goals. MGE is committed to \nproviding customers with the tools and \nresources they need to make wise energy \nchoices that help reduce their individual \ncarbon footprints. \nWe strive to \"meet customers where they \nare\" to engage them in energy efficiency. \nThrough the use of new technologies, \nhands-on workshops, energy education, \nconservation kits and rate options like \nTime-of-Use, MGE is helping to empower \ncustomers to take control of their energy \nuse to better manage long-term costs and \nto achieve deep decarbonization.\nNew smart thermostat program \nlaunched\nElectric use peaks during stretches of \nhot, humid days when air conditioners \nare running in a majority of homes and \nbusinesses. These periods of high electric \nuse put pressure on utilities to generate and \ndistribute enough electricity to everyone \nwho needs it. Working with Focus on Energy \u00ae\nFocus on Energy, Wisconsin's statewide \nenergy efficiency and renewable resource \nprogram, is MGE's partner in educating \ncustomers about the value of energy \nefficiency and conservation. MGE works \nwith residential and commercial customers \nseeking incentives and rebates through \nFocus on Energy to make energy-saving \nimprovements. For example, Klein's Floral \nand Greenhouses in Madison used Focus on \nEnergy incentives to implement a number of \nenergy efficiency measures, including new \nhigh-efficiency heaters and boilers, ceiling \ninsulation and double-pane windows. Building on the success of our Nest \nthermostat pilot with 500 customers,  \nwe launched in 2019 a new program,  \nMGE ConnectTM. With customers' \npermission, minor temperature adjustments \nare made to participating customers' smart \nthermostats to reduce energy use during \nperiods of high demand. \nMGE Connect is now double the size of \nour original smart thermostat demand \nresponse program and includes a number of \nsmart thermostat brands. The program will \nhelp MGE better understand the role and \nimpact of smart devices in managing our \ncommunity grid while helping customers \nreduce their energy use with minimal \npossible impact on comfort.\nMGE also is exploring opportunities to \nwork with community partners to make The partnership later earned Focus \non Energy a dotComm Award, which \nrecognizes excellence in web creativity \nand digital communications. The Industry \nInfluencer Award was for MGE's \"takeover\" \nof Focus on Energy's Instagram page in \nJune 2019. During the daylong \"takeover,\" \nmembers of MGE's marketing team \non Instagram shared their day-to-day \nencounters with energy efficiency, \nincluding their attendance at Focus on \nEnergy's award presentation for Klein's  \nown excellence in energy efficiency.smart thermostats available to low-income \nhouseholds.
