{"page_content": "EMPLOYEES, \nCUSTOMERS \nAND \nCOMMUNITIES\nTwenty-five years ago, a small, \ninformal group of MGE employees \nconcerned about the environment \nlaid the groundwork for something \nmuch greater. Their efforts evolved \ninto a successful companywide \neffort to make environmentally \nresponsible choices at work. From \nestablishing a vehicle idling policy \nto expanding recycling efforts, \nMGE's employee-led Green Team \nhas helped the company achieve \nmilestones in corporate sustainability \nand responsibility.Sustainability Steering Team\nToday, our Green Team remains active \nand strong with a new structure and focus \non advancing our history of sustainable \npractices. \nIn 2018, MGE formed a Sustainability \nSteering Team. The goal is to ensure we are \ntaking a more global approach in proactively \ngrowing our culture of sustainability \nthroughout MGE.\nThe Sustainability Steering Team will \noversee our Environmental Management \nSystem (EMS). It also will support \nexternal sustainability engagement and \nbenchmarking such as our participation \nin the Green Tier and Green Masters \nprograms. And, having team members from \ndepartments across the company will be a \nmore efficient way to gather data for our \nvoluntary sustainability reporting efforts.\nContinuous Improvement Sustainability \nTeams\nThe Sustainability Steering Team will \nreview, evaluate and prioritize continuous \nimprovement opportunities. The group also \nwill commission continuous improvement \nteams to take on specific improvement \ninitiatives and tasks.First team making progress\nThe first Continuous Improvement \nSustainability Team is charged with \noverseeing the expansion of our EMS  \nto cover all of MGE's operations.  \nCurrently, the EMS focuses only  \non Blount Generating Station.\nBuilding and implementing an expanded \nEMS is a major undertaking that requires \na great deal of up-front documentation. \nThe team is making great progress on the \nrequired documentation for the EMS \nand has identified an environmental risk \nassessment process, which is discussed  \non page 54.\nThe team also proposed improvements to \nour environmental policy. A new, updated \nversion of our companywide Environmental \nand Sustainability policy is available on page 1.\nWisconsin Monarch \nCollaborative\nMonarch butterflies face many risks \nthat are causing a serious decline in their \npopulations. According to the Wisconsin \nMonarch Collaborative, in the last 20 years, \nthe eastern North American monarch \nbutterfly population has declined by 90%.One of the biggest impacts on the monarch \npopulation is the loss of habitat for breeding, \nmigrating and overwintering. Pesticides \nused to control insects and weeds also \nhave harmful consequences for monarchs. \nThe loss of habitat is forcing changes in \nmigratory patterns.\nCreated in 2017, the Wisconsin Monarch \nCollaborative is working to create \nand implement a statewide monarch \nconservation strategy that covers habitat \ncreation and enhancement, education and \noutreach, and research and monitoring. \nMGE is proud to be a part of the Wisconsin \nMonarch Collaborative.\nImportance of pollinators\nIn addition to monarchs, MGE also is  \nworking to help protect pollinators. \nPollinators play an important role in ensuring \nthat the fruits, vegetables and other plant \n42 41", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
