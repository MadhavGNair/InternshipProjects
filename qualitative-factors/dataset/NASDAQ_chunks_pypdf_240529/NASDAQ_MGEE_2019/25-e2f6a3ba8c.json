{"page_content": "Falcon restoration\nSince 2009, peregrine falcons have \nnested at our Blount Generating Station \nin downtown Madison, Wis. Man-made \nnesting boxes at power plants have proven \nideal homes for the birds of prey, which are \nan endangered species in Wisconsin. The use \nof DDT pesticide beginning in the 1940s \neradicated them.\nFalcons were reintroduced to Wisconsin \nin the 1980s and have made a slow, steady \ncomeback due to statewide efforts and nesting boxes like the one at Blount. The \noriginal nesting box at Blount was installed \nin 1999. It was built by an MGE employee \nand his son. In fall 2018, due to renovations \nat Blount, employees built a new falcon box \nand moved it to a new location at the plant, \nwhich the falcons used in 2019 for nesting.\nMGE has seen 42 falcons hatch at  \nBlount, including the 2019 chicks. Falcon \nexpert Greg Septon visits Blount every \nspring for our naming ceremony during \nwhich the chicks also are banded for tracking throughout their lifetimes. For \nmore information on MGE's falcons, visit \nmge.com/falcons.\nMGE is proud to support the ongoing \nrecovery of these raptors through our \nnesting box and support from the MGE \nFoundation for Hoo's Woods Raptor  \nCenter, a local nonprofit dedicated to  \nthe rehabilitation of birds of prey and  \nthe preservation of their ecosystems.\nLance-leaf Coreopsis\nCoreopsis Lanceolata\nEst. 2019\nMadison, Wis.Lance\nSky Blue Aster\nSymphyotrichum Oolentangiense\nEst. 2019\nMadison, Wis.Aster\nShowy Goldenrod\nGoldySolidago Speciosa\nEst. 2019\nMadison, Wis.\nIn 2019, the chicks' names were inspired by \nwildflowers in recognition of the important role \nwildflowers play in providing habitat for pollinators.0.33 lb/MWh\n414.0 tons1.629 lb/kWh\n2.91 million tons\n0.71 lb/MWh\n886.5 tons\n0.05 lb/MWh\n63 tonsCO\u2082\nNO x\nSO\u2082\nPM\nHG\nCO\u2082NOx0.0000046 lb/MWh\n11.5 lbs\n01\n0\n1.5.2\n.86 All-electric\n    vehicles\nAll-electric\nvehicles6 Electric hybrid\n    bucket trucks\nElectric hybrid\nbucket trucks\nPercentage decrease since 20052018 emissions\n2018 recycling numbersMGE EV/hybrid \ufb02eet\nMGE EV/hybrid \ufb02eetPeregrine timeline\n22 Gas/electric\n      hybrid vehicles \nGas/electric\nhybrid vehicles \n19 69PM\n91HG\n92SO\u2082\n97The use of the pesticide \nDDT begins during \nWorld War II.\nThe peregrine population \ncontinues to decline; there \nare no peregrines in\nthe eastern U.S.\nWisconsin bans the use of DDT.\nThe Environmental Protection \nAgency bans the use of DDT.\nThe American peregrine falcon \nis listed as endangered under the \nEndangered Species Act.\nMGE installs its falcon nesting \nbox at Blount Generating Station.\nThe peregrine falcon is \ndeclassi\ufb01ed as a federally \nendangered species.\nA pair of falcons begins using\nMGE's nesting box, hatching \nthree chicks named Steve, \nGenny and Cole.\nThree falcon chicks hatch in\nMGE's nesting box, bringing the \ntotal to 42 chicks since 2009.1940s\n1960s\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1999\n2009\n2019\n514UPOT\nMetal\n161UPOT\nAll-in-one\no\ufb03ce recycling\n0.50\nUPOT\nAkaline batteries\n3.98UPOT\nPaper\n4.79UPOT\nE-waste\n52.8UPOT\nWood pallets6622\nMGE annually hosts a naming and \nbanding ceremony for our falcon chicks \nat Blount Generating Station.\n50 49", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
