{"page_content": "Preventing sprains and strains\nMGE supports employees through \na partnership with a workplace injury \nprevention sports medicine provider that \nemploys athletic trainers. These trainers \nteach employees how to properly warm up \nand stretch before performing physically \ndemanding work. This partnership was \nlaunched to address sprain and strain \nprevention proactively and before medical \ntreatment becomes necessary.\nWe recognize that our operations \nemployees are industrial athletes. Like \na professional athlete, working athletes \nneed the highest level of support and care. With easy access to the athletic trainers, \nemployees are able to get the coaching they \nneed from someone who understands the \ntype of work they do and the type of injuries \nthey may experience. Our trainers can help \nwith early intervention to minimize and even \neliminate those injuries. In early 2019, the \nprogram expanded to include MGE's office \nemployees.\nAs a result of this partnership, sprain and \nstrain injuries requiring medical treatment \nhave fallen dramatically. It's a positive \nprogram for employees and the company, \nreducing injuries and producing savings in \nthe workers' compensation fund.Risk Team Six\nAs we work to build on the historic safety \nsuccess from 2018, our sixth CI Team is \nfocusing on risk behaviors at work. Risk \nTeam Six developed a strategy to gain a \nclear understanding if risks are taken by \nemployees, why they would take risks \nand how to mitigate risks. The team is \nworking with 28 focus groups of operations \nemployees to develop a proactive plan  \nto address risk behaviors.Near-miss/good catch\nMGE's near-miss/good catch reporting \nprocess continues to be successful.  \nThis proactive process, developed by  \nan employee-led CI Team in 2017, is \ndesigned to encourage reporting that \nidentifies, documents, addresses and  \nallows everyone to learn from safety \nimpacts. The reporting process establishes \naccountability at all levels of the company  \nto ensure it is implemented in a safe,  \nno-blame environment. \nIn two years of using the near-miss/good \ncatch process, more than 130 near-miss \nand good catch reports have been filed. \nSharing near-miss/good catch reports with employees is designed to help all  \nemployees learn about safety issues  \nand to help prevent incidents, both of  \nwhich serve to improve our safety culture \nand collective performance.\nEmployee wellness\nMGE offers employees a comprehensive \nwellness program. Our Healthy Rewards \nprogram includes exercise classes led by \nprofessional instructors; a fitness room with \nexercise equipment; educational sessions \non nutrition, wellness, weight control and \nsmoking cessation; expertise available  \nfrom the Mayo Clinic through the \nmanagewell.com website; biometric \nscreenings; health assessments; and  \nannual flu shots. These offerings promote \nhealthy living for our employees.\nEmployee-led Risk Team Six completed a rapid \nimprovement workshop and developed a plan  \nto address employees' risk behaviors at work.\n30 29", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
