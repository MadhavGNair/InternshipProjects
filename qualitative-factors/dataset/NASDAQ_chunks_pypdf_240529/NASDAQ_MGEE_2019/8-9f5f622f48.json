{"page_content": "The voluntary program began in early \n2017 with a 500-kilowatt (kW) array in \nthe city of Middleton. When complete, \nthe expansion will lower the price per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) for new and existing \nparticipating customers. \nRenewable Energy Rider \nOur Renewable Energy Rider gives MGE \nthe ability to partner with larger business \ncustomers who seek customized renewable \nenergy solutions. It is designed to meet \nthe needs and goals of companies that \nsupport or have signed on to the Corporate \nRenewable Energy Buyers' Principles, \na collaboration facilitated by the World \nResources Institute and the World  \nWildlife Fund. \nState regulators approved in 2019 our first \nRenewable Energy Riders with the City of \nMiddleton and the Middleton-Cross Plains \nArea School District. The City and school \ndistrict will purchase a 1.5-MW share of \nsolar power from a 5-MW array that will be \nbuilt at the Middleton Municipal Airport. MGE and Dane County are partnering on a \nsolar installation of up to 9 MW at the Dane \nCounty Regional Airport under our Renewable \nEnergy Rider. The project, if approved by \nregulators, will cover about 58 acres. \nMGE also is proposing a solar array, the \nO'Brien Solar Fields, of up to 20 MW in \nFitchburg, Wis. Part of the array would serve \nlarger customers under Renewable Energy \nRider agreements.\nGreen Power Tomorrow\nGreen Power Tomorrow \n(GPT) is our green \npricing program. At a \npenny more per kWh, \nGPT is a convenient and effective way for \ncustomers to support renewable energy \nand offset their greenhouse gas emissions. \nToday, more than 9,600 customers buy \ngreen power through this program. Our \nGPT program is largely served by our wind \nresources in the region.Customer-owned solar \nWe also work with customers who want  \nto install solar to help power their homes \nor businesses. These customers connect \nto our community grid and sell their excess \nelectricity to MGE. We have partnered with \nmore than 675 customers to connect their \nsolar installations to our grid.\nCollaborations with our communities\nMGE has an ongoing collaboration with \nthe City of Madison around renewable \nenergy, electric vehicles, energy efficiency \nand conservation. See page 21 for more \ninformation about our partnership to grow \nthe use of all-electric mass transit. \nMGE also serves as a member of the Dane \nCounty Council on Climate Change. \nThe council includes local government, \nbusinesses, utilities and environmental \norganizations. MGE's partnership with \nlocal stakeholders through the council \noffers another opportunity to work \ntoward common goals, including deep \ndecarbonization.Partnering with our customers \nto grow clean energy \nShared Solar\nWe are expanding our popular community \nsolar program, Shared Solar, with a 5-MW \narray to be built in 2020 at the Middleton \nMunicipal Airport. Seventy percent of the \nproject will serve our Shared Solar program, \nwhich offers customers locally generated \nsolar energy. \nGroundbreaking ceremony at Middleton \nMunicipal Airport for Morey Field Solar. \n(L-R) Jeff Keebler, MGE Chairman, President  \nand CEO; Gurdip Brar, Middleton Mayor;  \nDr. Dana Monogue, Superintendent MCPASD; \nand Don Peterson, MGE VP Energy Technology.\n16 15", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2019.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
