Colleagues \nwore the color pink throughout the month and \nparticipated in a variety of fundraising activities including bake sales, raffles, sponsored bike \nrides and a 5K Run in support of women with \nbreast cancer. Several of our markets also offered \ncustomers the opportunity to join the Think Pink \nefforts and raised money via our Video on Demand platform. Overall, Liberty Global raised more \nthan $138,000. But Think Pink wasn\u2019t just about raising money \u2013 it was about raising awareness \nand encouraging early detection. A number of our \noffices hosted workshops for employees to raise \nawareness of the risk factors and early warning signs for breast cancer. Breast Cancer Awareness \nMonth is our selected charitable cause every two \nyears. In alternate years, we support Movember to \nraise awareness and funds to support men\u2019s health \nresearch, specifically prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health.
