We created an active program using \ndata privacy \u201chealth checks\u201d, encouraging our DP \nChampions to get out into our retails stores and call centers as well as the wider business, to evaluate \ncurrent practice, identify gaps and work with \nstaff to establish new privacy safeguards. Almost immediately, the DP Champions identified areas to \nimprove team processes around data handling.
