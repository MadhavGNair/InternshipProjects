To calculate NPS, \nwe ask customers how likely it is \nthat they would recommend us \nto their family and friends. Our NPS is the sum of the customers \nwho would recommend us, \nminus the ones who would not. In 2014, we standardized this \nmethodology across all our \nmarkets. We now have a baseline benchmark for action planning \nand consistent tracking and \nmeasurement over the coming years.    \nIncreasingly, we use customer \nfeedback to guide not only \nservice performance but also \nproduct development. For example, before we launched our \nnext generation entertainment \nplatform Horizon TV in Poland, \nwe installed test boxes in \nover 1,000 homes. Customer feedback was used to refine \nthe product and determine the \nright time to launch the service. As a result, the Horizon TV \nNPS scores in Poland were the \nhighest we have ever seen for a Horizon launch. We have also \nused the same approach for \nother products including mobile \nservices in Switzerland, the \nNetherlands and Hungary.PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST\nMapping out the \ncustomer journey \nAcross our footprint, we are \nlooking at our business from the \npoint of view of our customers \nand listening to them to better understand their needs. We \nhave been mapping out the \ncustomer journey, which includes \nall customer interactions with \nus, so that we can measure satisfaction and pinpoint areas \nfor improvement. For example, in \nIreland, we felt we could improve the self-install process for Horizon TV. Using insights from \nour customer journey mapping, \nwe began to make simple \nchanges, like color coding cables \nand relocating information stickers. This had a big impact \nfor our customers, and within a \nmonth, customer feedback (NPS) on installations had improved \nsignificantly. \nOur proactive approach \nto customer experience \nIn 2014, Telenet started a new \nproactive service check program \nto help customers optimize their \nhome environment and get the full benefits from our products \nand services. The new service \ngoes well beyond the scope \nof standard installations and \ntechnical services in response to customer requests. In many \ncases, we proactively identify a \nneed and suggest a service check \nto the customer. This includes \nsending a Telenet technician to check the WiFi signal throughout \nthe customer home, identifying \nweak signal areas and installing additional access points to \nimprove coverage as required. In \naddition, the technician ensures \nthe customer can connect the devices they want to WiFi and \nhas an up-to-date TV set-top box, correctly configured to \ndeliver the best performance. \nListening and \nresponding to our \ncustomers\u2019 needs\nFor customers, the positive \nnature of their interactions with \nus is often equally as important \nas the services we provide them. At Virgin Media, our \u2018Voice of \nthe Brand\u2019 program analyzed \nmore than 3 million interactions with customers to identify \nthose positive behaviors that \nmade a difference. Using this information, we prepared a \ntraining and support program \nthat aimed to improve every interaction. For example, \u2018Voice \nof the Brand\u2019 toolkits provided \nall frontline staff with valuable \ninsight on how to connect with \ncustomers. Across the business we trained around 10,000 \ncustomer-facing staff to adopt \nthese skills. As a result, negative customer comments dropped to  \nan all-time low in 2014.
