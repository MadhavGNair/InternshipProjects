{"page_content": "In 2020, the annual Code training completion \nrate was 100 percent. In addition to the Code, \nwe provide new hire and annual training that \naddresses anti-bribery/anti-corruption, gifts, meals \nand business entertainment; conflicts of interest; \ninternational trade law, international human \nrights and insider trading; and our whistleblower \nrequirements and processes for reporting ethics \nand compliance concerns. This training provides \ninformation and education on key ethics and \ncompliance risk areas, as well as clear direction to \nemployees that Syneos Health expects everyone \nto carry out their responsibilities in an ethical and \ncompliant manner.\nAdditionally, we developed and implemented \nseveral other compliance and ethics policies \ndesigned to meet fundamental requirements of an \neffective compliance and ethics program, including \npolicies on governance, training, risk assessment, compliance screenings, investigations, disciplinary \nactions and corrective action. These policies \nincorporate compliance program requirements and \nstandards contained in the U.S. Federal Sentencing \nGuidelines and other applicable government guidance.\nBeginning in 2019 and continuing on a biennial \nbasis, Syneos Health formally assesses the \nmaturity of our compliance and ethics program. \nThis assessment is conducted using relevant \ngovernment guidance (e.g., DOJ Evaluation of \nCorporate Compliance Program guidance) and  \na formal maturity assessment tool. We use the \nresults of these assessments to measure the \nmaturity and effectiveness of our program against \nthese available benchmarks and implement \ntargeted improvements, including those related  \nto each of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines  \n\u201c7 Elements\u201d (e.g., training, investigations, \nmonitoring and auditing).\nReporting a Concern\nUnder our Code and policies, employees have \nan affirmative obligation to promptly report any \nknown or suspected violations of applicable laws, \nregulations, Company policies and ethical standards \nand/or the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We \nhave established various mechanisms for individuals \nto raise matters of concern regarding known or \nsuspected violations. Employees may also use these \nmechanisms to ask a question or seek guidance. \nOne avenue for raising such issues is the Business \nEthics Helpline . The Business Ethics Helpline \nprovides a means of filing a report anonymously \n(where permitted by applicable law) 24-hours a \nday, seven days a week, to a third-party service \nprovider (Navex Global). Employees, contractors \nand other third parties can dial the Helpline directly \nat the local numbers provided, or file a report \nonline using the Syneos Health Helpline URL or on \na mobile device. Individuals can report concerns \nor ask questions through the telephone line in \nany language by asking for a translator. Additional \nreporting mechanisms are identified in our Code \nand the Whistleblower Policy .We take seriously all reported ethics or compliance \nconcerns and have implemented standard \noperating procedures that govern the prompt \nreview and treatment of reports received. \nThe Company protects the confidentiality and \nanonymity of the reporter to the extent allowed by \nlaw and consistent with the need to conduct  \nan adequate investigation. \nStandard operating procedures also govern the \nproper escalation and investigation of reported ethics \nand compliance concerns. Under these procedures, \nreports are reviewed and investigated by either the \nCompliance and Ethics Office, Human Resources or \nthe Syneos Health Audit Committee as appropriate, \ndepending on the nature of the reported concern. \nAll reports are promptly and thoroughly investigated \nand documented, and appropriate corrective action \nis taken. Anyone who makes a report in good faith \nwill be protected from retaliation under the Company \nWhistleblower Policy, and anyone who retaliates \nagainst a reporter will be subject to disciplinary \naction. All employees receive information and \ntraining upon hire and on an annual basis thereafter \non the Syneos Health Whistleblower Policy. \nSYNEOS HEALTH 2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n  |  36", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SYNH_2020.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
