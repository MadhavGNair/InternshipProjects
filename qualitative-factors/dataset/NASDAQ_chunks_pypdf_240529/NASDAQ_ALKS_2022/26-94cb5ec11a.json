We continue to consult \nwith patients during the drug development process and \nbeyond, so that patient perspectives continue to inform the \ndevelopment and lifecycle management of our products.\nDriven by our patient-centered ethos, we advocate for, among \nother things, improved access to medicines and other forms \nof treatment.
