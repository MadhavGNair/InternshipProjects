Each standing committee of the Board \nundertakes an annual review of its charter and works with \nthe Board to make such revisions as it and the Board consider \nappropriate. A current copy of the charters for each of the \nstanding committees and the Financial Operating Committee \nis available on the Corporate Governance page of the Investors \nsection of our website. \nBoard\u2019s Role in Oversight of Risks \nand Opportunities\nAssessing and managing risks and opportunities is the \nresponsibility of our management, and our Board, directly and \nthrough its committees, oversees and reviews various aspects \nof the Company\u2019s processes for management of such risks and \nopportunities, including periodic review of Alkermes\u2019 operating \nplans and overall corporate strategy, and an annual discussion of key enterprise risks to the Company\u2019s plans and strategy and \nways to mitigate such risks, and key related opportunities. \nIn addition, the Board has adopted a Compliance Policy \nStatement pursuant to Section 225 of the Irish Companies Act \n2014.

Public policy plays an integral role in \nhelping to facilitate patient access to important medicines and in \npromoting and supporting medical innovation.\nOur public policy advocacy reflects our commitment to enhancing \npublic health and advancing medical innovation. We seek to do \nthis by advocating for, among other things, patient access to, \nand awareness of, medicines approved by the FDA for use in our \ndisease areas of focus, including addiction and serious mental \nillness, and treatment system reforms that foster patient-centered \ncare \u2013 care customized by the physician and patient to the clinical \nneeds of the patient, regardless of the treatment setting in which \nthe patient is seen. \nAt the federal and state levels, Alkermes team members actively \nparticipate in public policy discussions with governments, trade \nassociations, patient groups and other organizations to share our \nperspective and experience as a biopharmaceutical company \ncommitted to advancing therapies for patients with unmet medical \nneeds. \nOur public policy engagement is guided by our commitment to our \nCode of Conduct, and support of policies that benefit patients who \nmay use our products, including policies designed to support and \nimprove access to medicines and foster innovation in health care.\nFor both our federal and state engagement efforts, our public \npolicy priorities and positions are determined in consultation with \nour management team, and our Board is provided an update \nannually of, and opportunity to comment on, our advocacy \npriorities and efforts. We also hire outside firms  \nthat can provide expertise on our key policy issues.\nAdditional information on our public policy participation, our \npolitical contributions and our trade association memberships can \nbe found on the Public Policy page of the Responsibility section of \nour website.
