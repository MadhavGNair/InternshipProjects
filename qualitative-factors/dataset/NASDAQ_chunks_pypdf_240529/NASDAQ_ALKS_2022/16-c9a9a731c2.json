We have implemented programs across and sustainably. We have implemented programs across \nour organization to assess, reduce and optimize our water our organization to assess, reduce and optimize our water \nconsumption, and we examine opportunities to further consumption, and we examine opportunities to further \nconserve water on an ongoing basis. As a result of these conserve water on an ongoing basis. As a result of these efforts, overall absolute source water usage at our facilities efforts, overall absolute source water usage at our facilities \ndecreased 7% in 2021 compared to 2020, and decreased decreased 7% in 2021 compared to 2020, and decreased \n32% compared to our 2015 baseline measurement year, 32% compared to our 2015 baseline measurement year, \ndespite the opening of our new Waltham, MA R&D and office despite the opening of our new Waltham, MA R&D and office \nfacility.
