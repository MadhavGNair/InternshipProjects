Interactions with customers  \n must occur in a venue conducive to education and Alkermes  \n prohibits the provision of entertainment to its customers.  \n\u2022 Promotional communications must be truthful, not  \n misleading, fairly balanced with appropriate safety  \n information, and consistent with the product\u2019s label.\n.\u2022 Employees are prohibited from using items of value or  \n in-kind services to reward or induce a healthcare  \n professional to utilize, prescribe, purchase or recommend our  \n products.\n\u2022 The hiring of healthcare professionals as speakers or  \n consultants must be based on a legitimate business need  \n and free from inappropriate influences, and any fees paid to  \n healthcare professionals may not exceed fair market value of  \n the service being provided.\nPatient Safety\nWe are committed to ensuring the authenticity of our medicines \nand guarding against counterfeit products (those not equivalent \nin quality, safety and efficacy, or not containing the correct \namount of active ingredient and/or containing impurities) in the \nmarketplace in order to protect patients who use our medicines. \nAlkermes has established a standard operating procedure \n(SOP) in accordance with FDA regulations that provides for the \ntimely and efficient removal from the market of any commercial \ndrug product suspected or found to be defective.

Accordingly, beginning at the Company\u2019s 2022 annual \ngeneral meeting of shareholders, each class of directors that is \nup for election is eligible for a one-year term, and the Board will \nbe fully declassified as of the Company\u2019s annual general meeting \nof shareholders in 2024.  \nBoard Leadership\nRichard Pops, our CEO, serves as Chairman of the Board. \nRecognizing the equal importance of effective independent \noversight of the Board, the independent members of the Board \nannually elect an independent non-employee director to serve \nas the Lead Independent Director of the Board, with significant \nleadership and engagement responsibilities. Effective July 2022, \nNancy J. Wysenski was appointed to serve as the new Lead \nIndependent Director of the Board.
