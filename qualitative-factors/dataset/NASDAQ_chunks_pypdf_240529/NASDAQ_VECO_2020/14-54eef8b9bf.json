{"page_content": "Our Environmental & Social Responsibility Statement that specifies the need to\nmonitor our water sources, use and discharge and seek opportunities to conserve\nwater by practical means guides our water management approach. All water used in\nour direct operations is obtained from local water authorities and all discharge water\ngoes to local publicly owned treatment works. Within R&D, we use recirculating,\nclosed loop cooling systems to cool our equipment. Closed loop cooling is more\nefficient and does not require the replacement of water lost due to evaporation.\nWhile we currently do not track our water usage, we are collecting data and\ndetermining metrics to evaluate in the future.\n WATER MANAGEMENT\nAs a vital resource in our communities around us and in our operations, we place\ngreat importance in fulfilling our responsibility to meet all applicable laws and\nregulations. \nCURRENT WATER USEENVIRONMENTAL\nAROUND US - WITHIN US\n151 0 3 - 1\n3 0 3 - 1\n1 0 3 - 3R&D Labs\n80%Santitation\n20%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VECO_2020.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
