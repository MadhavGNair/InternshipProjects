{"page_content": "This inaugural report is a small step in a long journey, but we know that we\nhave the ability to do more and do better. Sustainability, like many of our\nbusiness operations, is an ongoing process. We will continue to keep track\nof our performance in the environmental, social and governance domains\nwhile looking within, around and beyond ourselves for opportunities to\nimprove. For subsequent reports on our sustainability strategy, we would\nlike to adopt incremental steps to collect more data to form baselines,\nwhich will in turn allow us to set measurable targets. As our business,\ntechnology, and the world around us evolves, we will continue to engage\nour stakeholders and reevaluate the issues that matter most to our\ncompany and society.\n \nWe invite you to contact investorrelations@veeco.com and tell us what you\nthink. We appreciate your feedback.\n26", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VECO_2020.pdf", "page": 25, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
