{"page_content": "SUSTAINABLE SOURCING OF MATERIALS \nWe prioritize the protection of the environment and human health through the responsible \nuse of materials. Our materials use is guided by our Environmental Health and Safety Policy, \nwhich takes reference from internationally recognized standards. We are committed to these \nstandards with targets and continue achieving annual progress towards compliance.\nThese include the European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and \nRestriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) \nregulations, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC\u2019s) Conflict Minerals \nrules.\nA similar level of oversight applies to our suppliers, who must abide by our Supplier Code of \nConduct as part of our sustainable supply chain framework.\nOur responsible materials use focuses on two key areas:\nConflict Minerals Hazardous SubstancesEthical Sourcing of Conflict Minerals\nMaterials such as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TGs) are necessary raw materials for the  \nsemiconductor sector, but are however classified as conflict minerals due to the mining of these \nitems in conflict areas. K&S is cognizant of the concerns surrounding the material source, and \ncommits to be free of conflict minerals in our products and supply chain.\nTo manage our efforts, a cross-functional global Conflict Mineral Committee led by Corporate \nQuality strives to ensure that our 3TGs come from ethical sources, guided by our Conflict \nMineral Sourcing Policy. \nRY201639%52%76%84%>84%\nRY2017 RY2018 RY2019 RY2020% Conflict-free Smelters Identified\nTARGET\n38\nENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2020.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
