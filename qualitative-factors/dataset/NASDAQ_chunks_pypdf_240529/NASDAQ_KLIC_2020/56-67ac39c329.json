{"page_content": "A Culture that Empowers and Supports   \nEngaging our employees with a fair and supportive work environment\nWe attract and retain our talents by offering not only progressive career paths and professional \ntraining but also competitive compensation. To ensure that all staff are paid fairly and equitably, \nwe take part annually in compensation surveys conducted by consultants such as Radford and \nMercer. This benchmarks the pay ranges for all of our positions and makes certain that our \nsalary and benefits9 are commensurate and aligned with globally recognized levels.\nEmployees in Singapore, Suzhou, and The Netherlands are under the purview of local trade\nunions. We work in partnership with trade unions to ensure that our labor practices meet the\nlatest standards.\nWe also create a rewarding and engaging workplace through good employee relations \nthat prioritize dignity and mutual respect, according to the Employee Code of Conduct. To \ncomplement the former, we implement an Open Door Policy that embraces formal and informal \nchannels of communication for employees to share feedback, voice concerns and raise \nsuggestions. Regular employee interactions are held to understand evolving expectations, \nsuch as the Voice of K&S \u2013 a global employee engagement survey.\nWe provide a global Whistleblowing Hotline for employees to share any grievances they may \nhave. All calls received will be investigated and reviewed by Legal, HR, and Audit departments \nwhere appropriate and reported to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. Employees also \nhave access to local HR representatives and the Global Vice President of HR.\n9 More information on employee benefits can be found at www.kns.com/Careers/Careers/Life-\nat-K-S#Benefits\n57\nPEOPLE", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2020.pdf", "page": 56, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
