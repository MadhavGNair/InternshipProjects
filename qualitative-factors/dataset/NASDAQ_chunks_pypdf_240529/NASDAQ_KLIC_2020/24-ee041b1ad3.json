{"page_content": "DEVELOPING A RESPONSIBLE & ETHICAL SUPPLY CHAIN\nThe Great Reset to Generate Increased Sustainable Value from our Supply Chain\nAs a leading provider of semiconductors with manufacturing facilities located across \nSingapore, Suzhou, Netherlands and Israel, we are cognizant that our supply chains have \nsizeable impacts on the environment and communities we operate in. \nWhile including sustainable supply chain management as a core focus is only a recent \nmove for us, it is now an integral aspect in our responsible business practices. A robustly \nethical supply chain balances K&S\u2019 business viability with social and environmental well-\nbeing by enhancing trust for our brand and driving business growth, while improving the \nlives of our key stakeholders such as the workforce, suppliers and customers along the \nchain. \nDeveloping sustainable value also includes diversification of the supply chain as a key \nsuccess factor in ensuring sustained, long-term business resilience. To ensure continuity \nof business operations in the event of disruptions which today happens with increasing \nfrequency, we source from a mix of local, regional and global suppliers in different parts \nof the world as one way to strengthen business resiliency and prevent costly downtime.\nIn particular, we are working to increase procurement from local or regional suppliers to \nreduce our environmental footprint from transportation. We have plans to increase the \nproportion of the local and regional sources by 15% over the next two years to drive \ncarbon footprint down by 20%.\nAs we work towards building an increasingly circular model, K&S takes a source-to-\ncustomer approach to embed sustainability into our entire manufacturing process. \nBy scrutinizing each node of the supply chain, we are able to identify opportunities for \nimprovement and develop efficient and long-term strategies.\n25DOING GOOD BUSINESS\nRaw Materials \n(Material topic: material use)\n\u2022 Suppliers who provide raw materials \nmust comply with Restriction of \nHazardous Substances (RoHS) and \nK&S\u2019 Conflict Minerals Policy \nRaw Materials Processing and \nComponent Production  \n(Material topic: supply chain \nmanagement)\n\u2022 Suppliers are subjected to \ndue diligence procedures for \nresponsible sourcing\n\u2022 Periodic reviews and corrective \naction management are conducted \nto promote accountabilityDesign, Manufacturing and \nAssembly \n(Material topic: customer health \nand safety)\n\u2022 Our processes are compliant \nwith ISO 9001, ISO 14001 \nand ISO 45001\n\u2022 A Go-Green Committee \nevaluates product content to \nreduce and eliminate the use \nof hazardous materials\n\u2022 We undertake health and \nsafety impact considerationsEnd-of-Life \n(Material topic: material use)\n\u2022 We disclose materials used in \nproducts so consumers can make \nresponsible decisions on end-of-\nlife disposal\n\u2022 We enact end-of-life agreements \nwith customers\n\u2022 Some products are refurbished \nand resoldSales, Marketing and After-Sales \nCare \n(Material topic: customer satisfaction)\n\u2022 We ensure correct labelling for \nCE certification and are RoHS \ncompliant\n\u2022 Customers benefit from after-\nsales care and maintenance Testing, Packaging and Distribution \n(Material topic: product and service innovation)\n\u2022 We have moved towards green packaging materials (i.e., replacing foam with recycled kraft \npaper)\n\u2022 Re-usable crates are used to ship demo machines to customers\n\u2022 We have implemented a paperless online system for transactions\nK&S Boundary", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2020.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
