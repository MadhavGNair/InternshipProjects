{"page_content": "DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS WITH \nENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY\nK&S is committed to achieving sustainable product design by finessing the equation of environment and economic positivity. One way in which \nwe enhance eco-efficiency in our value chain is by leveraging our core competency in innovation to drive target-segment improvement solutions \nthat boost environmental well-being at either the operations or product level.\nTo meet this challenge, K&S has developed and launched ULTRALUXTM, our latest generation ball bonder for LED-related projects.\nLower energy use:\n\u2022 10% reduction in carbon emissions generated due to in-built suite and ability to perform wide combination of specialty interconnects allow for \nincreased range of actions to be performed at one go\nMore efficient use of resources: \n\u2022 Greater precision due to automatic recipe generation over traditional manual trial-and-error work for reduced inaccuracies in output\n\u2022 Improved hardware design for longevity of machine \nGreater unit-per-hour rate\n\u2022 10% cost savings due to fewer ULTRALUXTM machines needed to produce the same output as conventional ball-bonders for greater \nproductivity gains\n\u2022 Improved UPH translates to space savings\nOverall, the ULTRALUXTM has not only allowed us to reduce our environmental impact through lowered energy use and improved material usage, \nbut also reduce running costs and increase overall product efficiency and accuracy to turn sustainability expectations into business value.Our customer - a major LED \nmanufacturer - deployed the \nULTRALUXTM in its operations, and \nrecorded\n10% \nreduction\nin energy use\n37\nENVIRONMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2020.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
