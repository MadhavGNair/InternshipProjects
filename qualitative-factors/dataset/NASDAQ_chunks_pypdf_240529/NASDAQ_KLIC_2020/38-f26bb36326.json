While K&S equipment is not required to be subjected to Restriction \nof Hazardous Substances (RoHS) guidelines mandated by the European Union (EU), in the \ninterest of health and safety, since 2018, we have strived to ensure that we are in full compliance \nwith the global benchmark and any updated restrictions that follow .In July 2019, the EU added four new phthalates2 to its existing \nlist of restricted substances. By FY2020,\nall K&S new platforms \nare declared RoHS for six \nsubstances.\nK&S is currently working towards having new platforms to be \n100%  compliant to the ten substances.\n1 The SEC\u2019s Reporting Year runs from January to December.
