In \na crisis, our BCM framework \nsafeguards our ability to run \na sustainable business to \nprotect the interests of our \nstakeholders.\nIn FY2020, we referenced \nthe ISO 22301 Business \nContinuity Management \nSystem to refresh our BCM \nframework and developed \na streamlined Business \nContinuity Plan (BCP) that \ncan be effectively and easily \nreferenced in the event of \na disruption. We adopted a \nstaged approach in rolling \nthis plan out across our six \nglobal sites and target for full \ncompletion by Q3 FY2021, \nbeginning with Singapore. \nOur refreshed BCM \nframework adopts a Plan-\nDo-Check-Act cycle (PDCA) \nand entails the following \nsteps.Establish\n\u2022 We form the Business \nContinuity (BC) \nGovernance team by \nconfirming the global \nCrisis Management \nTeam (CMT), a \nDisaster Declaration \nOfficer (DDO) and the \nrespective BC site leads\n\u2022 We also establish a \nBC Policy, Scope and \nMinimum Business \nContinuity Objective \n(MBCO) for K&S through \ninterviews with members \nof the ELT\nDetermine\n\u2022 We perform an in-depth \nThreat Analysis (TA) \nand Business Impact \nAnalysis (BIA) with CMT \nmembers to determine \nBC risks, and match \nthem with relevant \ncritical process timelines \nrequired to meet the \nMBCODevelop\n\u2022 We develop BCP \nrecovery materials \nconsisting of recovery \nstrategies to four \nidentified disaster \nscenarios\nImplement\n\u2022 We implement BC \nprocedures in the \norganization and ensure \nthat our employees \nunderstand and are \nfamiliar with them.
