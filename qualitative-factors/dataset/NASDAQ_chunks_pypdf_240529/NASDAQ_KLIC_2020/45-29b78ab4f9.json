{"page_content": "DELIVERING EFFICIENCIES WITH SMART MANUFACTURING\nFor over 65 years, we have driven the development of innovative solutions to create strategic \ncompetencies that enable us to deliver progressive value for our customers. As customers \nraise their standards for products and services that simplify lives and deliver greater value, \nadvances in smart manufacturing present a huge opportunity to make business sense out of \nIndustry 4.0. \nSMART\nMANUFACTURING\nIndustry 4.0 \nat K&SSMART\nMANUFACTURING\nIndustry 4.0 \nat K&SWe ensure that our machines, devices \nand sensors are connected and \nintegrated with each other. This is the \nbasis of smart manufacturing.Interoperability\nWe deploy robots and machines to \nsupport us in making decisions and \nsolving problems.Technical assistanceWe collate and synergise data from our \noperations to develop simulations and \ndrive analytics that enable us to \nexamine trends, anticipate outcomes, \nmitigate risks and make tactical \ndecisions.Information transparency\nWe  develop and utilize AI \nmachine-learning so that our systems and \nmachines can \u2018learn\u2019 and are able to \nmake decisions without human input. \nAI-enabled predictive analytics lead to \nsmoother processes, production \nefficiency, improved yields, better device \nquality and reduced waste.Autonomous decision-\nmaking\nOur vision of smart manufacturing involves the building of a digitally connected factory to drive \nnew manufacturing efficiencies by combining physical and cyber technologies. Integrating \ndiscrete systems and harnessing the power of large volumes of data to move towards greater \nautomation, our roadmap to integrating Industry 4.0 seamlessly into our operations involve four \nkey areas.\n46\nDELIVERING VALUE TO CUSTOMERS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_KLIC_2020.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
