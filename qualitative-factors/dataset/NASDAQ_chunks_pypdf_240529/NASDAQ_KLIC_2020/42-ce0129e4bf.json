{"page_content": "Minimizing Waste Discharge \nK&S commits to a long-term strategy of sound waste management throughout the lifecycle of any assets. Across our global manufacturing \noperations, we do so through two methods:\nReducing Generation of Non-hazardous Waste\n\u2022 Packaging Materials: Plastic, wood and paper\n\u2022 E-waste: Batteries and lamps\nIn FY2020, we improved our Non-hazardous \nWaste Recycling rate to \n59.6%\na 5.3% Y-o-Y increase from last year \nSafely Disposing Hazardous Waste: Factory waste of potentially toxic chemical nature \nReducing non-hazardous waste with the 3R approach\nAdopting the 3R approach of Reduce, Recycle and Reuse, we believe in inculcating and adopting an environmentally-positive mind-set \nthat affects daily habits which involves eliminating single-use disposables, conserving paper use and limiting printing, and repurposing \npaper, cardboard or e-waste for future use. SETTING THE \nLOCAL EXAMPLE \nFOR RECYCLING\nK&S Santa Ana has been lauded for their \nrecycling efforts which not only meet ISO \nstandards, but the city\u2019s recycling mandate. \nIn FY2020, the site achieved a 52% plant-\nfilled diversion rate for recycling waste \ncardboard, aluminum, glass, metals as well \nas e-waste, such as batteries and fluorescent \ntubes. Based on one key activity of digitizing \ntraining manuals, we have reduced paper \nuse by 62% alone.\nThese efforts have been widely featured in \nSanta Ana, with the site identified as a case \nstudy best-practice for other companies in \nthe area to emulate.
