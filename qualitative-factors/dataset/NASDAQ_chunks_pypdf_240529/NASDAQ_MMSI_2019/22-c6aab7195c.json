By diverting this waste, Merit Medical helps to \nreduce methane gas emissions that contribute to the air quality in our high-elevation mountain valley. Our food waste \nis processed, resulting in a natural source of methane gas that is pumped back into the natural gas system and used \nto heat homes and businesses. Since the launch of the program in 2019, Merit Medical employees have prevented 1.7 \nmetric tons of CO 2 emissions. These emissions would provide enough energy to charge 165,725 smart phones! \nMerit Medical also participates in the Blue Sky program through its electricity utility provider in Utah. The Blue Sky \nprogram allows consumers to purchase blocks of power from sustainable energy sources, such as wind and solar, \nresulting in annual savings of CO 2 emissions. 1.7  metric tons of CO 2 \nThat is the same amount of emissions it would take to \nprovide enough energy to charge 165,725 smart phones! \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MMSI_2019.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
