Once it is fully implemented at all of our manufacturing sites, we estimate  \nan annual savings of 2.8 million sheets of paper and 20,000 plastic sleeves.\nOur packaging engineers have designed and implemented a process that reduces blister packs and film thickness in \nseveral Merit Medical products. This newly designed packaging saves more than 20 tons of plastic per year without \ncompromising quality.\nWithin our molding operations, we have designed reusable universal transport trays that allow us to ship molded \ncomponents to our sister facilities without utilizing disposable trays for packaging. These reusable trays allow us to avoid \nusing over 1,600 disposable trays per month.\nMerit Tijuana employees are making small changes to reduce the amount of water they use.
