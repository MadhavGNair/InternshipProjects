{"page_content": "Studies show technology increases student \nengagement and makes certain tasks easier.  \nProving that learning improves with such tools,  \non the other hand, is more difficult. However, there \nis potential in VR technology \u2014 due to its immersive, \n3D nature with the combination of visual, auditory, \nand kinesthetic learning models \u2014 to better engage \nstudents and help them to retain key concepts.\nTo test this theory, AMD and Hunters Lane  \nHigh School in Nashville, Tennessee, launched a  \nsix-week experiment to determine student and \nteacher perceptions of VR-based learning and \nevaluate the potential for integrating VR  \neffectively into the classroom.\n\u201cOur preliminary information indicates students have \nbetter retention of the information because instead  \nof learning it one dimensionally, they experience the \ncontent on multiple levels, \u201d said Dr. Susan Kessler, \nHunters Lane principal. \u201cThe more experience-based \ncontent you have, the more likely kids are going to \nfeel connected to it. \u201d\nPerhaps most importantly, the VR experiment  \nmade students at Hunters Lane High School curious, \nand that can go a long way in helping develop  \nstudent agency.\n\u201cVirtual reality is going to change everything for \nthem, \u201d predicted Todd Duncan, Hunters Lane librarian. \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get them excited and engaged. Students \nare going to want to come to classes where VR is \nutilized as part of the lesson, and teachers can use  \nit in just about every subject. What you can do with \nVR is truly limitless. \u201d\nSTUDENT \nENGAGEMENT \nTHROUGH \nVIRTUAL REALITY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2017.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
