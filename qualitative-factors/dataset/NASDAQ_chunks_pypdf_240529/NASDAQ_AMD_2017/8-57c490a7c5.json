Currently there are more than 30,000 \nschools that do not have access to technology. \u201d\n\u201c AMD products offer a very good cost-benefit \nrelationship. They offer proper performance for our \neducational aims, and the affordable cost allows us \nto reach more children.

There  \nis a lot of work behind the scenes that we have been \nimproving upon school year after school year. We feel \nvery fortunate to be working with AMD in this pursuit. \u201d\nLearn more at unete.org/english\nDIGITAL \nINCLUSION \nACROSS MEXICO", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMD_2017.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
