{"page_content": "Starbucks Shared Planet - Our Responsibility\n Tackling Climate Change\nAddressing climate change is a big priority for Starbucks. Coffee farmers are reporting \nshifts in rainfall and harvest patterns that are hurting their communities and shrinking the available usable land in coffee regions around the world. We believe now is the time to increase our investments in solutions and strategies that address this crisis. \nThe steps we're taking not only address climate change for future generations \u2013 they help \nensure the supply of high-quality coffee that our customers expect from us into the future. \nWe're working to significantly shrink our environmental footprint by conserving \nenergy and \nwater, reducing the waste associated with our cups, increasing recycling and incorporating \ngreen design into our stores. We're also working with Conservation International to address \nclimate change on coffee farms. \nStarbucks total scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from roasting plant operations, store operations and company-owned \njets and vehicles in fiscal 2007 were 913,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. Because 75 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions come from the electricity used in our stores, offices and roasting plants, we are focusing our efforts on energy \nconservation. \nhttps://test.starbucks.com/SHAREDPLANET/customGRPage.aspx (38 of 108)6/1/2010 2:23:02 PM", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SBUX_2008.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
