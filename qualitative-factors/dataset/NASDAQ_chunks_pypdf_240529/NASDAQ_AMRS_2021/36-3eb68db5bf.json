Donating Because Black \nLives Matter\nIn 2021, Amyris brands renewed \ntheir pledges from the previous \nyear to demonstrate their \nsupport of the Black Lives \nMatter movement. \nWorking to Fight Infectious Diseases\nAmyris was founded in 2003 by three scientists from the University \nof California, Berkeley. In 2004, through a grant from the Bill & \nMelinda Gates Foundation, we developed technology to create \nmicrobial yeast strains that produce artemisinic acid, a precursor of \nartemisinin used in artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) to treat \nmalaria. This technology was licensed to Sanofi on a royalty-free \nbasis and approximately 120 million ACT treatments were delivered \nto help fight malaria worldwide. We are continuing to work with the \nGates Foundation to develop additional yeast strains that produce \nACT treatments at a low cost.\n2021 IMPACT AWARD:\nAND$10k \nfor research on effects \nof recently discovered \nDDT waste barrels off the \ncoast of Los Angeles\n$10k \nfor nonprofit to mobilize \nvolunteers to protect \ncoastal habitats necessary \nfor sea turtle recovery$50k  \nto Teaching Tolerance,  \nThe Conscious Kid and \nEmbraceRacePIPETTE PLEDGE\nMAKING LIFE BETTER\nOPERATING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLYAmyris 2021 ESG Report\n37PROTECTING PEOPLE AND THE PLANET MAKING LIFE BETTER OPERATING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2021.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
