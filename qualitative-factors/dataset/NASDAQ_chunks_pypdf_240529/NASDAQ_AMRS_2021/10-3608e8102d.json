We additionally \nconduct literature searches to \nreview the safety of the product \nand its impurities. If information \nis not readily available, we \nscreen for structural alerts using \nrecognized QSAR methodologies. \nFor safety evaluation of \nfinal cosmetic products and \nformulations, it is our intent to \nfollow the guidance from the \nEU Scientific Committee on \nConsumer Safety (SCCS) as this represents the strictest standard.  \nOur approach consists of a variety \nof tests, literature review and \nrisk assessment methods used \nin a tiered process to assess \nsafety. In vitro tests validated by \nthe Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development \n(OECD) are used to assess eye \nand dermal irritation, dermal \nsensitization and mutagenicity. \nFinal product formulations are \nscreened for prohibited and/\nor restricted substances and \nsubjected to an additional panel \nof safety tests, which include the \nfollowing:\n1. Eye and skin irritation in vitro \nscreening tests for formulations\n2. In vitro test for phototoxicity, \nif applicable when UV \nabsorbance is observed\n3. HRIPT (human repeat insult \npatch test) for allergenicity \nand/or photo allergenicity\n4. Use test under dermatological \nand ophthalmological review\n5. Microbial/challenge tests\n6. Testing for metals and \nphthalates\n7. Stability testsAmyris fully supports the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and does not use \nanimals or animal byproducts for cosmetic safety testing. Amyris invests \nsignificant effort in exploring new, alternative and validated methods \nto evaluate product safety and conducts risk assessments on specific \ncosmetic applications to understand the magnitude of exposure with \nrespect to the margin of safety. Full product safety reports with risk \nassessment are contracted with toxicological consulting groups for \ncommercial sale in Europe. In 2021, Amyris identified no incidents of non-\ncompliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning the health and \nsafety impacts of our products and services. \nPIPETTE CERTIFIED  \nPRODUCTS\nEczema Lotion, Cream to Powder and \nBaby Balm adhere to strict criteria to \nrecieve the National Eczema Association \n(NEA) Seal of Acceptance.\nBIOSSANCE EWG \nVERIFIED PRODUCTS\nTo receive Environmental Working \nGroup (EWG) VERIFIED status for use \non product labels and in marketing, \nthe product must pass EWG\u2019s rigorous \nlicensing criteria.Amyris 2021 ESG Report\n11PROTECTING PEOPLE AND THE PLANET MAKING LIFE BETTER OPERATING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2021.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
