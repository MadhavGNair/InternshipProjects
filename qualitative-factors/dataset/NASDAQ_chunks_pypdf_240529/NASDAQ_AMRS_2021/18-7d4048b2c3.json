{"page_content": "In 2021, our Leland facility \nexpanded its recycling \nprograms, and recycled over \n607 metric tons of isopropyl \nalcohol (IPA), a byproduct of \nour squalane manufacturing \nprocess. The facility shipped \nan additional 103 metric \ntons of IPA to a company \nthat reuses the chemical in \nproducts such as window \ncleaner. The heavy and light \nresidues from production are \nalso reprocessed to obtain \nadditional product and any \nremaining residual is burned  \nfor energy. \nThe light residues are being \nevaluated as a possible \nrenewable fuel for off-road vehicles. Catalysts used in the \nprocess are sent for reclamation. \nOverall, we calculate an \ne-Factor of <0.1 for our squalane \nproduction process (kg process \nwaste to landfill/kg product). \nOur Leland facility has reduced \nprocess wastewater generation in \nthe finished squalane process by \napproximately 40% since 2016.\nWastewater from the \ndownstream production of \nsqualane is non-hazardous \nand disposal is responsibly \nmanaged through local, \nlicensed water treatment \nfacilities. The wastewater is \ntreated and ultimately returned \nto the local waterways. Wastewater from the \ndownstream production  \nof squalane is non-hazardous \nand disposal is responsibly \nmanaged through local, \nlicensed water treatment \nfacilities.OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS GENERATES VERY LOW AMOUNTS OF \nWASTE. THE INDUSTRIAL FERMENTATION PROCESS GENERATES THREE \nPRIMARY WASTE STREAMS. \n1 2 3\nSugarcane waste, or \nbagasse, is used as a \nrenewable fuel.Fermentation waste, \nor vinasse, is used as a \ncrop fertilizer and water \nsupplement.  Evaporation residue is \nabout 5% of total product \nproduced. Amyris is \nreviewing the possibility of \nusing evaporation residue \nfor fuel blending.
