We do so while complying with all \napplicable regulations governing customer health and safety, and we \nwork to meet or exceed government regulations and industry codes \nregarding ingredients used in the global markets in which we operate. Producing Highly Pure \nMolecules with Clean \nChemistry\nUsing our proprietary Lab-to-\nMarket technology platform for \nclean chemistry, Amyris engineers \nthe genetics of yeast strains \nand then ferments the yeast in \nsugarcane syrup to convert basic \nplant sugars into molecules that \ncan be used as clean, sustainable \ningredients for consumer \nproducts. \nWe continue to improve our Lab-\nto-Market speed to identify and \ncommercialize new molecules. \nOur first commercial ingredient \ntook about 40 months from yeast \nstrain to pilot plant run, and today \nwe average less than 12 months \nfor this process. This has resulted \nin a 90 percent reduction in the cost of product development and \nan 80 percent reduction in time-\nto-market for new products. \nBy the end of 2020, Amyris \nhad commercialized 13 of our \nmolecules. In 2021 we added \nmany new targets to our \npipeline\u2014more than 20 are in \nactive development, and dozens \nmore are in the discovery phase. \nThe molecules and ingredients we \ndevelop serve as the foundation \nof our consumer brands.\nAmyris entered 2021 with three \nconsumer brands, all formulated \nwith Amyris\u2019 sustainable \ningredients as building blocks: \nBiossance\u00ae clean beauty skincare, \nPipette\u00ae clean baby skincare \nand Purecane\u2122, a zero-calorie \nsweetener naturally derived from \nsugarcane.
