{"page_content": "Reb M \n(Rebaudioside M) is a molecule \nfound naturally in the leaves of the \nstevia plant. Using our advanced \ntechnology platform, we isolate the \nReb M molecule, which is naturally \npresent in low concentrations (less \nthan 0.1%) in the plant and is difficult \nto extract through conventional \nharvesting. Reb M has a taste profile \nsimilar to sugar and does not have \nthe bitter aftertaste commonly \nassociated with stevia. Because of \nthe rarity of the Reb M molecule, \nwe estimate that the manufacturing process to create our Reb M requires \none eighth of the agricultural \nacreage compared to other leaf \nextraction methods. \nOur Reb M is commercialized as an \ningredient for multiple applications \nwhere there is a desire to replace \nsugar or other high-potency \nsweeteners in beverages, dairy \nproducts, baked goods, condiments \nand confections on the market. In \naddition, it can be found in our zero-\ncalorie sweetener consumer brand, \nPurecane.Amyris 2021 ESG Report\nCERTIFIED SQUALANE\nAmyris\u2019 sugarcane-derived squalane \npromotes sustainable manufacturing \nprocesses. It is a USDA-certified \nbiobased product and an ECOCERT-\ncertified raw material. \nSqualane \nSqualane is an ingredient widely used in many types of beauty and \npersonal care products and is traditionally sourced from sharks or olive \ntrees. Amyris has developed squalane derived from sugarcane, which \noffers a sustainable, stable, highly scalable and affordable alternative to \ntraditional sources. This exceptionally moisturizing ingredient features \nprominently in Biossance and Pipette products and is also marketed \nunder the Neossance\u2122 squalane brand to supply many of the world\u2019s \nleading beauty and personal care brands. By replacing shark-derived \ningredients with our sugarcane-derived squalane, Amyris estimates that \nwe avoid the killing of over 2.7 million sharks per year.\nPROTECTING PEOPLE AND THE PLANET MAKING LIFE BETTER OPERATING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY\n1/8th\nof agricultural acreage  \nused compared to other  \nleaf extracting methods\n9", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2021.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
