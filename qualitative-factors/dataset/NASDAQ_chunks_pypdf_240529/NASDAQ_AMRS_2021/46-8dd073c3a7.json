Using this organizational boundary, \nAmyris accounts for 100% of the GHG emissions for operations over which it has operational control. Amyris does not have operational \ncontrol over coworking spaces. \n2021 is our first inventory and so that has been selected as our baseline year.\nThe GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard was used in the energy and emissions calculations which include all \ngases covered by the Standard: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3. Amyris has no emissions from biogenic sources.\nElectricity emission factors are obtained from the International Energy Agency\u2019s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 2020 report, and \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) publication. Global warming \npotentials are obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report.Amyris 2021 ESG Report\n47APPENDIX", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2021.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
