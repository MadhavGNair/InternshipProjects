{"page_content": "Conserving Water, Reducing Use of Harmful Chemicals  \nand Building Resilience to Climate Change\nThe primary raw material we use to develop our ingredients is \nsugarcane, a rapidly renewable crop. Amyris is a member of \nBonsucro, a global organization that promotes sustainable sugarcane \nproduction, and ensures that the Brazilian sugarcane we use is \nsustainably and ethically produced and processed. In 2021 we \nreceived Bonsucro\u2019s Chain of Custody Certification for the second \nyear in a row. Achieving certification requires meeting strict standards \nfor GHG emissions per ton of sugarcane harvested and per ton of \nsugar output, as well as ensuring worker rights. \nCompanies certified by Bonsucro commit to a code of conduct, which \naligns with multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals, including \nResponsible Consumption and Production (Goal 12) and Climate \nAction (Goal 13). Brazilian sugarcane is grown in the relatively drier \ncentral-southern regions of Brazil. Studies have found no correlation \nbetween sugarcane-derived ethanol expansion and deforestation.We partner with Ra\u00edzen, one of \nthe world\u2019s largest sugarcane \nproducers, to provide the \nsugarcane feedstock used \nin our fermentation process. \nRa\u00edzen was the first company in \nthe world to obtain Bonsucro \ncertification for one of their \nplants. The Ra\u00edzen sugar mill \nfor Amyris\u2019 Barra Bonita \nfermentation plant is also \nBonsucro-certified.\nIn recent years, the practices \nused to farm our sugarcane \nhave made several important \nimprovements, leading to \ngreatly reduced emissions, \nenergy use and pesticide use. \nGreener crop management \npractices and land preservation \nmeasures have helped lessen \nland use impacts and enhance \nlocal biodiversity. The use \nof traditional pesticides has \nbeen reduced by over 30% as they are replaced with bio-\npesticides. Crop burning is no \nlonger allowed, and sugarcane \nused in Amryis production \nprocesses is exclusively \nharvested by mechanical \nmeans. Ra\u00edzen has been a \nleader in adapting to the \nshift in sustainable farming \npractices, as reported in their \nannual ESG publications.\nSugarcane in Brazil is primarily \ndry cropped, meaning that \nrainfall is the only water source \nfor crop growth. Processing \nthe sugar requires more water. \nAlthough our sugarcane is \ngrown in areas that are not \nwater stressed, as part of \nBonsucro certification, Ra\u00edzen \nsugar mills have established \nwater saving metrics. The mills \nmaintain water consumption \nper ton of sugarcane within the \nlimits established by Resolution Amyris 2021 ESG Report\n2x Recipient \nof Bonsucro\u2019s Chain of Custody Certification PROTECTING PEOPLE AND THE PLANET MAKING LIFE BETTER OPERATING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY\n16", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2021.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
