{"page_content": "Reducing our Carbon Footprint at our Facilities\nAmyris is aligned with global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions, as agreed through the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, \nand has set ambitious targets to significantly reduce emissions \nby 2030 from our 2019 levels. Every year Amyris celebrates Earth \nMonth and holds many events and seminars to increase employee \nawareness of energy conservation and its importance. \nAt all Amyris-operated facilities we closely track GHG emissions, \ntoxic air contaminants and other gases that have environmental \nimpacts such as acidification and eutrophication. All of our facilities \nare operated in compliance with U.S. federal, state and local air \nboard requirements.Amyris looks for every opportunity \nto evaluate and reduce the use of \nenergy derived from fossil fuels and \neither eliminate its use or replace \nit with a renewable source. \nAmyris\u2019 corporate headquarters \nin Emeryville, California is in a \nLEED Silver-certified building \nthat includes four on-site co-\ngeneration power units. The \npower produced by these units, \nrelative to the amount of power \nfrom the local utility, is equivalent \nto taking 719 cars off the road \nannually. Our facility lighting is \nexclusively from LED or energy-\nefficient green fluorescent bulbs. \nIn addition, building automation \nsystems minimize the use of \nenergy for lighting and cooling in \nour office space.\nOur laboratory in Emeryville \nis a Platinum Level Certified \nLab through My Green Lab\u00ae, \nawarded in 2019. My Green Lab \nis a platform recognized for \noutstanding work in reducing \nthe environmental impact of lab \noperations. We have implemented \nprograms to reduce the electricity \nused in our lab operations, \nincluding by conducting energy assessments on our equipment, \nreplacing older freezers with \nnewer, EnergyStar-rated models \nand adjusting processes to reduce \nenergy, such as raising feasible \ntemperatures for storage. Our \nefforts have reduced the energy \nassociated with cold storage by \napproximately 30%.\nWith respect to energy use in \nmanufacturing, Amyris is in the \nprocess of commissioning a new \nmulti-platform fermentation \nplant next to a large sugar mill \nin Barra Bonita, Brazil. Through \na partnership between Amyris \nand Ra\u00edzen, the owner of the \nsugar mill, the plant is intended \nto produce our successful Reb \nM zero-calorie sweetener, in \naddition to several other cosmetic \ningredients and fragrance and \nflavor molecules, using renewable \nsugarcane sugar as feedstock.Amyris 2021 ESG Report\nPROTECTING PEOPLE AND THE PLANET MAKING LIFE BETTER OPERATING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY\nENERGY REDUCTION\nEnergy associated  \nwith cold storage\n  30%\n14", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2021.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
