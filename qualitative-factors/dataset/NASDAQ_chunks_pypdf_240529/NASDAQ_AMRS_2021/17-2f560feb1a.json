{"page_content": "Reducing Waste in our Packaging and Operations\nAmyris is committed to using recyclable materials in product \npackaging. Complementing the use of renewable ingredients,  \nthis ensures our products are as sustainable as possible for both \npeople and the planet.\nOur consumer brands, including Biossance and Pipette, have worked \nto replace non-recyclable materials used in bottles, tubes, caps and \nother packaging with recyclable materials including post-consumer \nrecycled (PCR) plastics and bottles manufactured using sugarcane \nethanol instead of petroleum derived energy sources. The outer \nboxes for many Biossance, Pipette and Purecane products are made \nfrom tree-free sugarcane pulp, a byproduct of sugarcane processing, \nto reduce the amount of paper we consume. In 2021, the majority of \nsugarcane paper was sourced from Verit\u00e9, which is a leading human \nrights nonprofit organization focused on responsible sourcing. The \nuse of sugarcane byproduct also advances sustainability by making \nuse of a waste stream.The ingredients we develop \nare shipped in recyclable \ntotes, jerricans and drums. For \nshipments of key intermediates, \nwe have implemented the \nuse of flexitanks, which are \nrecycled after use and have \nnegated the need for cold \nshipments. \nOur laboratory facilities in \nEmeryville and our Aprinnova \nmanufacturing facility in Leland \nhave implemented programs \nto sort non-hazardous waste \nstreams and promote employee \nawareness of recycling streams. \nIn Emeryville, we seek to \nrecycle all disposable plastic \nlab equipment that is free \nfrom hazardous chemicals. In \n2020, our Emeryville laboratory \nfacilities set and met a goal \nof diverting more than 90% \nof lab waste from landfill \nand in 2021, over 95% of the \nhazardous waste produced \nin our Emeryville laboratory facilities was diverted from \nlandfill, either through recycling \nor incineration for energy \nrecovery. \nAll non-hazardous lab solid \nwaste is incinerated for energy \nrecovery and hazardous liquid \nwaste is recycled or incinerated \nfor energy recovery. Any liquid \nwaste from our fermentation \nprocess is repurposed for \ndust control at our waste \nmanagement partner\u2019s site in \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico. In \n2021, several process wastes \nwere tested and reclassified as \nnon-hazardous.\nAs often as possible, we reuse \nand recycle byproducts from \nour sugarcane processing. \nFor example, we make our \ningredient Biosilica\u2122, an \nalternative to silica which is \nwidely used in the cosmetic \nindustry, from sugarcane ash.
