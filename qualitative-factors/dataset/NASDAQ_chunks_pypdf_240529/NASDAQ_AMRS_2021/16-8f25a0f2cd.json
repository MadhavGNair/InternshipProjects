Measures are in \nplace to greatly reduce the \namount of water needed for \nsugar processing, including \npreemptively collecting and \nstoring rainwater and use of \ngray water.\nThe amount of water needed \nfor feedstock preparation is \napproximately 50 L/kg sugar \nbased on Ra\u00edzen annual ESG \nreporting for the Paraiso \nMill (previously a source of \nfeedstock for Amyris). This is \nlower than global averages for \nbioethanol production using \nsugarcane (estimated at 210 \nL/kg). Approximately 30% \nof the water used to make \nsqualane is returned to the \nfields as vinasse, to supplement \ncrop water needs and provide \nadditional nutrients. \nDownstream water requirements \nfor squalane processing have been reduced by approximately 65% \nsince 2016 due to our continuous \nprocess improvements. \nAmyris processes use a \nlimited number of hazardous \nmaterials and whenever \npossible, less hazardous, \nmore environmentally friendly \nreagents are used. Amyris \nmodified yeast strains are \nclassified as Risk Group 1 \n(non-pathogenic) and are fully \ndeactivated prior to disposal \nusing validated methods.
