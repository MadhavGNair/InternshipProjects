{"page_content": "Since 2020, we have partnered with Carbonfund, a non-profit \norganization, to purchase carbon credits to offset GHG emissions \ngenerated by shipments from our business-to-consumer websites. \nIn 2021 this led to offsetting approximately 54 metric tonnes of \ncarbon emissions from customer orders traveling 417,745,938 air \nand ground miles. Our purchase of carbon offset credits supports \nforest conservation initiatives. \nThe Barra Bonita fermentation \nplant is built to improve operational \nefficiencies and utilizes renewable \nenergy to supply steam and \nelectricity to power the plant. \nSteam will be supplied through \na co-generation system using a \nsugarcane byproduct, bagasse, \nas a fuel source during the \nsugarcane growing season. It is \nonly during the short off-season \nthat steam will be supplied by a \nconventional boiler. Electricity \nfor the plant will be supplied by \nrenewable hydroelectric power \nplants in the area. By building our \nproduction plant next to Ra\u00edzen\u2019s \nsugar mill, we avoid carbon \nemissions from transporting the \nfeedstock by trucks.One of the products of \nour fermentation process is \nsubsequently used to manufacture \nsqualane, a primary ingredient \nin many of our clean beauty \nbrands. This sugarcane-based \nsqualane is manufactured \nat a facility in Leland, North \nCarolina, where we have a joint \nventure with Nikkol Group called \nAprinnova. The Leland facility \nhas implemented process and \nfacility improvements to increase \nenergy efficiency, including \nconsolidating production steps, \nimproving insulation and retrofitting \nequipment. The facility has been \nreplacing its existing lighting in \nthe manufacturing area with LED \nbulbs and has replaced all office \nlighting with green fluorescent bulbs. Estimated GHG emissions \nbased on production volume \nhave been steadily decreasing \nas a function of process and \nfacility improvements. This \nfacility has no mobile sources, \nwith the exception of forklifts, \nand all indoor forklifts have been \nconverted to electric models. This \nfacility is permitted as a small \nquantity emitter, and emissions \nof gases such as toxic air \ncontaminants, sulfur oxides and \nnitrogen oxides are very low.Amyris is committed to reducing \nthe environmental impact of our \nproduct distribution. Our supply \nchain has taken action to shorten \ntransit routes and reduce cold \nstorage transport. In addition, all \nof our direct-to-consumer order \nshipments for our Biossance, \nPipette and Purecane brands \nare carbon neutral. We are also \nconsidering requiring the use of \nrenewable fuels for our transport \nneeds in Brazil. \n0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5\nT CO 2e/T Farnesene*  \nConsumedReducing  \nEmissions  \nIntensity at  \nAprinnova\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 20163.21\n2.59\n1.27\n.89.96.86\n*Farnesene is a key \nprecursor ingredient of \nAprinnova productsAmyris is proud to be a Partner in the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency\u2019s (EPA) SmartWay program, which helps \ncompanies advance supply chain sustainability by measuring, \nbenchmarking and improving freight transportation efficiency.Reducing the Environmental Impact of our Product Distribution: Amyris 2021 ESG Report\n15PROTECTING PEOPLE AND THE PLANET MAKING LIFE BETTER OPERATING OUR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMRS_2021.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
