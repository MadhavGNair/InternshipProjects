At every \nstage our quality standards must be met, \nOur Approach to Sustainable \nCoffee Production\nMany measures are needed to sustain the farms that \nproduce high-quality coffee, as well as their surrounding \ncommunities. Starbucks has adopted an integrated approach \nto sustainable coffee purchasing, which includes six \nfundamental measures:\u2022 Paying premium prices to help farmers make pro\ufb01  ts and \nsupport their families.\n\u2022 Encouraging farmers to participate in Coffee and Farmer \nEquity (C.A.F .E.) Practices.\n\u2022 Operating our own Farmer Support Center (agronomy \ufb01  eld \nof\ufb01  ce) in Costa Rica that enables us to collaborate with farmers \nand provide them the technical support and training needed to \nensure the sustainable production of high-quality coffee.FARMERS/PRODUCERS\nEstates  are medium- to large-scale \nfarms that typically employ workers to \nhelp harvest and process the coffee \ncrops. Estates usually have their own \nprocessing facilities.\nSmall farms  are usually family-run farms \nthat grow coffee on 5\u201312 acres (2\u20135 \nhectares) along with other crops of fruits \nand vegetables. Small-holder farmers deliver \ntheir harvested crops to a collection point, \nwhere they are sold to an intermediary or a \nprocessor. They are typically self-employed \nand might hire one or more workers, and \nprobably rely on their families to help \nduring the harvest season.COOPERATIVES\nSmall-holder farmers often form cooper-\natives to achieve economies of scale, \nobtain bargaining power and collaborate on \nproduction methods. Cooperatives  also serve \nas processors and sometimes as exporters. \nFair Trade Certi\ufb01  ed\u2122 coffee is produced \nexclusively by cooperatives.WET MILL PROCESSORS\nWet mills  buy or receive coffee cherries from \nfarmers and process them by removing the \nfruit and drying the beans. They are stand-\nalone operations or integrated facilities on \nlarge farms or cooperatives. Some wet mills \ncan handle the dry mill processing on-site. \nIf not, they send the coffee beans to a dry \nmill for further processing. \nFarmers/producers \u2013  We ask to see the \ninvoice or receipt for the coffee that \nthe farmer delivered to the processor or \nexporter. If the farmer represents a large estate, wage and salary transparency is \nalso requested to determine whether farm \nworkers are receiving fair compensation for \ntheir labor.STARBUCKS COFFEE \nSUPPLY CHAIN\nIn \ufb01  scal 2004, Starbucks began requiring \ndetailed and veri\ufb01  able documentation for \n\ufb01  nancial transactions along the supply chain. ECONOMIC TRANSPARENCY\nProcessors \u2013  Evidence must be furnished \nindicating payments up and down the \nsupply chain, including payments made \nto farmers and receipts from exporters ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SBUX_2004.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
