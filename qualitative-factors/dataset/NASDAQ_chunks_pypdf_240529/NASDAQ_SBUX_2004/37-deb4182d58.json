{"page_content": "36\nSOCIETY\nCase Study: Our Experience in San Francisco\nStarbucks ambitious growth strategy may sometimes appear \nat odds with our strong desire to contribute positively to \nour communities. Consider San Francisco, a market we \ufb01  rst \nentered in 1992, and one where we\u2019ve gradually added more \nlocations to keep pace with increased customer demand. \nAt the end of \ufb01  scal 2004, there were 70 Starbucks stores \nin San Francisco, including a few licensed operations. Our \nSan Francisco customers have been enthusiastically loyal and \nhave helped make this a pro\ufb01  table market for us.\nOur growth has also stirred sentiments from some \npassionate residents who are striving to retain the charm \nand \ufb02  avor of their wonderful neighborhoods. A group \nof residents took issue with formula retailers that have \nmore than 11 locations and a standardized look. They \nlaunched a campaign and successfully lobbied for a citywide \nordinance that bans or restricts chain stores from certain \nneighborhoods. The impact of the legislation that passed \nin March 2004 restricts Starbucks growth in the Hayes \nValley and Cole Valley neighborhoods. The situation in \nSan Francisco is remarkably similar to what has occurred \nin other places \u2013 from Coronado, California, to Bristol, \nRhode Island. \nStarbucks respects the will of local citizens to preserve their \nneighborhoods. However, we don\u2019t believe that Starbucks is \ndetrimental to local businesses, especially other coffeehouses. \nAccording to an article in the Wall Street Journal,  the battle \nbetween independent coffeehouses and Starbucks may be \none of the most misunderstood rivalries in retailing. Most \nindependent coffeehouses are doing \ufb01  ne \u2013 and have found \nproximity to Starbucks to be a bene\ufb01  t.* \nWe believe there\u2019s plenty of room in the market for \nStarbucks to expand alongside the growing number of \nindependent coffeehouses. As we grow, we must focus on \nengaging with local groups, listening to our neighbors about \nwhat\u2019s important to them and determining how Starbucks \ncan best contribute to their neighborhoods. If we take \nthis approach, we believe Starbucks will be welcome in \nmost communities. Despite the challenges we\u2019ve encountered in San Francisco, \nStarbucks continues to directly and indirectly contribute to \nthe city. In \ufb01  scal 2004 we:\n\u2022 Employed more than 1,000 partners locally and \nprovided an estimated $19.1 million in salaries/\nwages and bene\ufb01  ts.\n\u2022 Paid an estimated $16.3 million in local and \nCalifornia State taxes.\n\u2022 Offered healthcare bene\ufb01  ts to all eligible part-time and \nfull-time partners, including their spouses, domestic \npartners and eligible dependent children.\n\u2022 Contributed $98,000 in grants and product donations \nto local nonpro\ufb01  t organizations, including the Every \nChild Can Learn Foundation and Urban Solutions.\n\u2022 Inspired our partners and customers to volunteer \nnearly 400 hours in the community, which is equivalent \nto one person working full-time for 10 weeks.\n * Source: \u201cCounting Beans \u2013 Despite Starbucks Jitters, Most Coffeehouses\n  Thrive,\u201d the Wall Street Journal,  September 24, 2002 \n ** For information about UCO, see page 38.Starbucks partner Juan Michel manages the Fillmore \ndistrict Starbucks store in San Francisco, which opened in \n2004.
