Individual board members are up for election \nevery three years and are nominated based on speci\ufb01  c criteria \nintended to strengthen the overall quality and depth of the \nboard. For instance, each candidate should demonstrate \nintegrity and ethics in his/her personal and professional life. \nIn addition, each candidate should contribute to the board\u2019s \noverall diversity \u2013 in terms of background, gender, race, \nethnicity or other differentiating characteristics \u2013 to add to \nthe variety of opinions and perspectives.\nThere are three committees of the board: Audit and \nCompliance, Compensation and Management Development, \nand Nominating and Corporate Governance. All three are \ncomposed of independent directors.\nBoard Diversity\nThe members of Starbucks board have professional \nexperiences in various industries, such as technology, \n\ufb01  nancial investment, consumer products, retail, and the \ngovernment and nonpro\ufb01  t sectors. Of the 11 members, \none is female and one is African American. \nExecutive Compensation\nTo determine compensation for Starbucks chairman, \npresident and ceo, and other certain executives, the \nCompensation and Management Development Committee \n\ufb01  rst examines the compensation levels at peer group \ncompanies and strongly considers the company\u2019s short-term \nand long-term performances. All independent directors \nvote on the committee\u2019s speci\ufb01  c recommendations for the \nexecutive compensation package, which consists of three \ncomponents: annual base salary, incentive bonuses and stock \noption awards. \nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nAt present, there is not a committee of the board dedicated \nto CSR. However, Starbucks senior vice president of CSR \nreports directly to the company\u2019s president and ceo, and \nhas access to present CSR-related matters at the company\u2019s \nboard meetings.Starbucks Auditline\nExternal stakeholders (non-partners) may call Starbucks \nAuditline with concerns regarding accounting controls or \nauditing matters and they may refer communications to the \nBoard of Directors, to the committees of the board and to \nindividual directors.\nEmerging Issues Council\nTo assess potential risks and opportunities to the company, \nStarbucks created an Emerging Issues Council (EIC) in \n2004. The EIC is a cross-functional team of Starbucks \nexecutives led by our vice president of CSR. \nT wo issues the EIC will address in \ufb01  scal 2005 pertain to \ncocoa purchasing and climate change:\n\u2022 Cocoa purchasing \u2013  Starbucks purchases processed \ncocoa and chocolate through suppliers that source \nfrom several tropical countries, including the Ivory \nCoast, West Africa. In 2001, allegations arose about the \nuse of forced child labor on cocoa farms in the Ivory \nCoast. Starbucks has shared our concerns about these \nallegations with our suppliers, who have assured us that \nthey are taking measures to ensure that their purchasing \npractices promote sustainable and responsible cocoa \nfarming. However, the EIC will continue to monitor \nthis issue and, if necessary, adopt new policies and \nmeasures related to our cocoa purchases.\n\u2022 Climate change \u2013  The potential threat that climate \nchange poses to the environment and to coffee-growing \ncommunities has led the EIC to prioritize this issue. \nIn 2004, Starbucks conducted a climate inventory of \nour greenhouse gas emissions. The EIC will evaluate \nan emissions reduction strategy and determine whether \nother measures are needed for Starbucks to proactively \nand responsibly address the issue of climate change in a \nleadership capacity.\nMore information, including our \ufb01  scal 2004 Proxy Statement \nthat discusses executive compensation and our Corporate \nGovernance Principles and Board Committee Charters, is \navailable online at www.starbucks.com/aboutus/investor.asp.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SBUX_2004.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
