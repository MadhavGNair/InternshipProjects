{"page_content": "Cybersecurity\nOUR APPROACH\nOur comprehensive risk-based program, aligned \nto the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and \noperated by our global cybersecurity team, is \ndesigned to identify and manage data security \nand privacy-related risk through a combination \nof technology and robust governance. We foster \nstrategic approaches to cyber risk management \nand operational resiliency through strong \ncollaboration with the IT, Enterprise Risk, \nLegal, and Compliance teams; and promote \naccountability and transparency through a \nnumber of reporting lines including regular \nAudit Committee reporting, and further \noversight through independent third-party \nreviews of the\u00a0program.\nACTION AND PROGRESS\nLEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE\nOver the past year we have bolstered the \nleadership, transparency, and governance \nof the cybersecurity program. We welcomed \na new CISO who brings over two decades \nof information security experience, to the program, is a member of, and reports to the \nEnterprise Risk Committee; co-chairs the \nsubcommittee for Operational Resiliency and \nCyber Risk with the firm\u2019s Head of Enterprise \nRisk; and reports regularly to the Board\u2019s \nAudit Committee.\nEDUCATION AND AWARENESS\nWe significantly enhanced our cybersecurity \neducation and awareness program this past \nyear through the use of revamped annual \ninteractive video training sessions, live line-\nof-business cyber-briefings, and monthly \nrandomized simulated malicious email (or \n\u2018phish\u2019) testing.\nPORTFOLIO COMPANY OUTREACH\nAn undetected cyber incident can have \nsignificant negative reputational, operational, \nor financial impacts on a business. Accordingly, \nthis past year we started outreach efforts to \nincrease cyber-awareness amongst our private \nequity portfolio to ensure companies are \nappropriately prepared to manage cyber threats \nand related risk.OUR FUTURE\nCONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\nIn the year ahead we will be making significant \ninvestments in our foundational platforms \nand associated controls, as well as event \nmanagement systems, and control validation \nplatforms. This will allow us to further expand \nour detection and response capabilities and \nprovide actionable data.\nREDUCTIONS IN PORTFOLIO \nCYBER\u00a0RISK\nEfforts around the portfolio outreach program \nwill continue with educational events, incident \nresponse tabletop exercises, as well as a private \nequity portfolio wide cyber risk assessment. \nData gleaned from the risk assessment will \nbe leveraged to improve upon cyber maturity \nwhile reducing the risk of a cyber-related event \nnegatively impacting our portfolio companies.\nSPOTLIGHT\nREDUCING CYBER RISK THROUGH INCREASED AWARENESS  \nWITHIN THE PORTFOLIO\nLast year we launched our Cyber Portfolio Outreach efforts with a threat briefing and \npanel discussion for our Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council, which consists of over \n35 technology leaders from across our Private Equity portfolio. The hour-long event \nwas moderated by the firm\u2019s Technology Portfolio Advisor, with briefing and discussion \npresented by two Partners from the Cybersecurity Practice of Mayer Brown, Facebook\u2019s \nCIO,\u00a0and our own CISO. Council members left with a greater awareness of the current cyber \nthreat and regulatory landscape, as well as key strategic and tactical initiatives to consider.Our holistic, cross-organizational approach to protecting \ninvestor and business data, as well as resiliency of our \ninformation systems, is paramount to our success.\nWith the ever increasing incidence of cyber threats such as ransomware \nattacks, large scale data theft, and supply chain associated attacks, it is \nimperative that we continue to build-out and improve our cyber governance, \nsecurity engineering, operations, and education programs to effectively \nmanage the continuously changing threat landscape. \nCASE STUDY\nSTRENGTHENING THE FRONT LINES OF CYBERSECURITY\nWhile a comprehensive, risk-based cybersecurity program is a necessity to properly \nmanage cyber risk, cyber attacks begin and end with people. As such, in 2021 we revamped \nour employee cyber-awareness program and increased the number of simulated phishing \nemails sent to test our employee base. Monthly randomized simulated attacks included \npoint-in-time training for those who \u2018fail\u2019 the test. All told, we delivered over 1,300 hours \nof training and more than 6,700 simulated phishing attacks, which by the end of 2021 \nresulted in a 78% year-over-year reduction in employees who failed the tests.\n2021 HIGHLIGHTS 2021 2022 + TARGET\nYOY REDUCTION IN SIMULATED PHISH \n\u201cFAILURE\u201d RATE78% 30%\nSIMULATED PHISHING E-MAILS \nDELIVERED >6,700 >18,000\nCYBER EVENTS INVESTIGATED 3,455 >6,000\n15\nINTRODUCTION RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY \n& INCLUSION CLIMATE CHANGE PHILANTHROPYENTERPRISE RISK \nMANAGEMENTGOVERNANCE, \nCOMPLIANCE & ETHICSSUPPORTING & \nDEVELOPING TALENT CYBERSECURITY ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
