We \nmade significant progress on our initiative i n 2021,  including completing  an assessment \nthat e valuates the maturity of safety programs of the company,  launching quarterly \nreviews of key safety metrics for companies in the i nitiative, and comparing \nperformance to  indust ry benchmarks. 12 out of the 15 in-scope c ompanies either \nperformed better than the industry benchmark or improved performance year-over-year; \nwe are focused on driving improvement at the remai ning company and onboarding new \ncompanies in 2022.\nAddit ionally, we launched industry-specific quarterly c alls to share best practices and \nengaged an external expert to provide additional support  and guidance on our health \nand safety initiative. For instance, the external  expert  supported several companies in \nthe Consumer and Healthcare industries  to track employee safety metrics, such as \nworkplac e employee injuries, for the first time. Given these companies were exempt from \nOSHA regulations based on their business models, t his was a new and important step in \norder to increase transparency and ensure safe workplace environments.\n2021 SAFET Y MATURIT Y GAP ANA LYSIS\n2021 Safety Maturity Score\n2022 Safety Maturity ScoreCo.
