{"page_content": "What We Are \nFocused On \nEnablers of success\nAccelerating impact across our Corporate \nSustainability and Responsible Investment \nactivities requires a multi-year focus on \nthe foundational elements of a robust and \nvibrant ESG program: 1) Embedding ESG \ninto our culture by activating our global \nemployee base to shape our priorities and drive implementation, 2) Increasing \ntransparency through data by translating \nour qualitative objectives into more \nquantitative goals, and 3) Expanding our \nspheres of influence through external \npartnerships and collaborative cross-\nindustry problem solving.While the specific activities under these \nheadings may change from year to year their \nrole as key enablers of sustained impact \nwill not.THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST\nOur material issues are based on what we deem most important to our stakeholders and most \nsignificant to our long-term performance. We intend to perform a materiality assessment with \nour senior leadership annually, with the next assessment to be completed in 2022. We have eight \nmaterial topics, seven of which relate to corporate sustainability. The eighth topic, Responsible \nInvestment, spans across all of our investment strategies. These topics form the basis of our \nsustainability strategy and structure of our report herein. \nGOVERNANCE\nENVIRONMENTALESG\nSOCIALRESPONSIBLEDIRECT LENDING\nARES INSURANCE SOLUTIONS\nINVESTMENT\nENTERPRISE RISK\nMANAGEMENTINCLUSIONDIVERSITY,ALTERNATIVE CREDITEQUITY &\n TALENTSUPPORTING& DEVELOPINGLIQUID CREDITPRIVATE EQUITYCYBERSECURITYARES SSG\nGOVERNANCE,& ETHICSCOMPLIANCEPHILANTHROPY\nINFRASTRUCTURECLIMATE\nREAL ESTATESECONDARIESCHANGEOUR MOST \nMATERIAL  \nISSUES\u00a0SIGNIFICANCE OF \nFINANCIAL IMPACT \nTO OUR BUSINESSIMPORTANCE  \nTO STAKEHOLDERS \nEMBEDDING ESG INTO \nOUR\u00a0CULTURE\nAfter creating a distributed resource \nmodel of 120+ ESG champions across \nour investment strategies and corporate \nfunctions in 2020, we began to add \ndedicated ESG specialists by line of \nbusiness. We believe a combination of \nthe two \u2014  ESG specialists partnering \nwith homegrown ESG champions  \u2014  is the \nbest way to integrate ESG within each \nteam\u2019s culture.INCREASING TRANSPARENCY \nTHROUGH DATA\nWhile 2020 was a year for defining the \ndata collection needs for each ESG \nintegration plan, 2021 was the year of \nmore systematic\u00a0collection and analysis of \nthat data. Throughout this report you will \nsee more data across both our Corporate \nSustainability and Responsible Investment \nsections, an effort that we plan to expand in \nfuture reports.ENGAGING WITH LIKE-\nMINDED PARTNERS TO MOVE \nOUR INDUSTRY FORWARD\nJust as we focus on accelerating the \nimpact we can achieve directly, we know \nthat longer-lasting systemic change will \nonly happen through partnering with other \nlike-minded firms, shareholders, limited \npartners, industry associations, and non-\nprofits, among others. In 2021 we launched \nindustry initiatives with traditional \ncompetitors and supported other programs \nthat we feel have the potential to transform \nESG practices across private markets.\n4\nCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nINTRODUCTION\nABOUT THIS REPORT 2021 HIGHLIGHTS CEO LETTERWHAT WE ARE \nFOCUSED ON", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
