Gross direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions in metric tons of CO 2 equivalent.\nb. Gases included in the calculation; whether CO 2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, NF3, or all.\nc. Biogenic CO 2 emissions in metric tons of CO 2 equivalent.\nd. Base year for the calculation, if applicable, including:\ni. the rationale for choosing it;\nii. emissions in the base year;\niii. the context for any significant changes in emissions that triggered recalculations of base \nyear emissions.\ne. Source of the emission factors and the global warming potential (GWP) rates used, or a \nreference to the GWP source.\nf. Consolidation approach for emissions; whether equity share, financial control, or \noperational control.\ng. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.a. 46.9 tCO 2e \nb. CO 2, CH4, N2O, CO 2e. HFCs. \nc. n/a \nd. 2021 is the first year with scope 1 emissions.\ne. Defra 2021 emissions factors were applied (appendix A). This inventory estimates carbon dioxide \nequivalents (CO 2e) using global warming potentials from the AR4 Assessment Report.\nf. Operational control approach applied. \ng. Detailed methodology and list of assumptions applied are in section 3 of the RSK report.\n305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) \nGHG emissionsThe reporting organization shall report the following information:\na. Gross location-based energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions in metric tons of CO 2 equivalent.\nb. If applicable, gross market-based energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions in metric tons of \nCO2 equivalent.\nc.
