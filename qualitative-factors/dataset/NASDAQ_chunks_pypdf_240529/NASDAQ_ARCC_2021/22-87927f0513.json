Following an initial \nscreening of investment opportunities \nusing our exclusion criteria, our research \nteam undertakes proprietary due diligence, \nsupported by third-party research, to assign \ncompanies an ESG rating. ESG\u00a0risks and \nopportunities are highlighted and discussed \nat investment committee, monitored regularly \nand reviewed quarterly through a process \nled by our Quantitative Risk & Research \nteam. ESG -specific reporting enables \nportfolio managers and investors to better \nunderstand ESG risks and opportunities \nwithin\u00a0their portfolios.\nUSING OUR VOICE\nWe believe debt holders have an important \nrole to play in encouraging responsible \nbusiness practices. Our tenured team of over \n40 investment professionals is well-positioned \nto engage with management teams on environmental, social, and governance issues. \nUnderstanding ESG issues is a vital tool for \naccelerating our impact beyond the binary \ndecision to buy or sell a credit instrument.\nACTION AND PROGRESS\nIn 2021, we expanded our responsible \ninvesting\u00a0toolkit. We formalized an ESG \nintegration plan, more fully embraced \nthese themes in our daily conversations on \ncredit and incorporated incremental ESG-\nbased exclusionary screens within new \nCLO (collateralized loan obligation) fund \ndocumentation. We codified our ESG scoring \nframework as well as a quarterly review \nprocess and reporting for internal purposes \nand for clients upon request. We also achieved \nour goal of engaging with 10\u201315% of our over \n900 portfolio companies on ESG topics.\nOUR FUTURE\nOur goal for 2022 is to build upon our existing \nESG framework to further our impact and \nbetter track outcomes on sustainable business \npractices through the following key objectives:INSTITUTIONALIZE MORE RIGOR AND \nMETRICS TO OUR SCREENING AND \nMONITORING PROCESS\n\u2022 Tighten screening to incorporate additional \nexclusions  and better identify \u201cbest in class\u201d \nsustainable investment opportunities across \nour portfolios.\n\u2022 Investigate additional sources of ESG data,  \nparticularly on environmental metrics.\nPERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT ON \nESG METRICS\n\u2022 Initiate attribution and performance \nreporting on ESG metrics  in addition to \nother credit factors.\nRAISE ENGAGEMENT TARGET AND \nREFINE ENGAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\u2022 Increase engagement goal to over 20% of \nour portfolio companies  and develop a more \ndetailed template for tracking KPIs.The global reach and scope of Liquid Credit enables Ares to \nextend its emphasis on sustainable business practices to a \nbroad range of businesses and industries.\nGlobal Liquid Credit\u2019s investment solutions enable fixed income investors to capitalize on \nopportunities across the universe of US and European syndicated bank loans and high yield \nbonds.
