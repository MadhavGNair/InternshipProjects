Vmo employees completed a materiality survey, ranking eight topics based on (i) what was deemed most important to\u00a0stakeholders and (ii)\u00a0the significance of the financial impact on the business. Through this survey, we found that Vmo identified climate change, business ethics, and employee engagement (e.g.,\u00a0philanthropy and DEI) as the highest priority topics to address. The next step will be to develop KPIs and objectives for each topic. Vmo has formed an internal working group\u00a0\u2014 led by Bob Brown, Executive Chairman\u00a0\u2014 to drive this next phase. OUR SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES STRATEGY\nOur Special Opportunities strategy, with $11.8 billion of assets under management, is focused on pursuing debt and non-control equity solutions in middle market companies undergoing transformational change, stress or distress.\nFor our control investments, we seek to actively engage portfolio companies both pre- and \npost-investment on ESG-related matters to potentially mitigate any material ESG-related risk and/or explore potential value creation opportunities. For our non-control investments, we focus on integrating ESG into pre-investment diligence and active post-investment monitoring whenever possible. In 2021, we made significant progress in both our control and non-control investments with regard to systematizing our approach.\n\u201cOur team made great strides in 2021 to \nsystematically integrate ESG into our \ndiligence and post-investment monitoring \nprocess. We\u2019re focused on continual \nimprovement and are excited to explore \nnew, innovative ways of incorporating ESG \ninto investment structuring.\u201d\nScott Graves  \nPartner, Co-Head of Private Equity GroupESG INTEGRATION IN THE SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES INVESTMENT PROCESS\nSOURCING\n\u2022Apply Ares responsibleinvestment strategyscreening framework.\n\u2022Negative screen foropportunities involvingharmful products/services.\n\u2022Escalate potential investmentsin industries that have apossible adverse ESG impact.Decide whether to furtherpursue an investmentusing objective data andanalysis of key ESG-relateddiligence items.DILIGENCE\n\u2022Highlight key ESG  \nconsi derat ions during  \ninitial discussion with  \nthe Investment \nCommittee.\n\u2022Assess key ESG risks and  \nopportunities.
