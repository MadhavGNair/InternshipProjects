{"page_content": "Disclosures (cont.)EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEYS We conduct a fulsome employee engagement survey of our global employees at least annually. The topics range from engagement to career development, leadership, diversity, compensation, \nbenefits, onboarding and culture. In response to this survey, we partner with business unit leads to increase effective communication, collaboration and benchmarking our benefits offerings. One of the changes we implemented in 2021 was a firm-wide week-long winter holiday in December to allow employees to disconnect that did not count toward our employees\u2019 regularly allotted vacation days. In addition to our annual employee engagement survey, we administer a number of surveys throughout the year (e.g. for new joiners, at the 45 day mark, ad hoc pulse surveys for various groups, exit surveys). We typically report on all surveys conducted and work with business unit leads to come up with strategies for each group to address employee feedback received.\nRESPONSIBLE MARKETING POLICY\nAs Ares is subject to global rules and regulati ons governi ng the promotion and sale of its products, strategi es and investment management services, we have adopted a Marketing  and \nAdvertising Policy.

To\u00a0that end, the firm has implemented a comprehensive and enterprise-wide cybersecurity program, which is aligned to the well recognized NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The program is underpinned by a set of periodically audited policies and procedures, which amongst others includes the Cybersecurity; Data Protection; and Data Privacy policies; and for which all employees are trained and certify to their compliance annually. The program is run by a dedicated internal cybersecurity team, which through augmentation by external partners provides 24x7 monitoring, investigation, and response to potential cybersecurity threats affecting the firm. The team is led by our Chief Information Security Officer, who sits on the firm\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee as well as Data Privacy Task Force, and regularly reports to the Audit Committee. As noted above, the firm maintains a Data Privacy Policy and provides Investors with a copy of the Data Privacy Notice, which summarizes what personal data the firm collects and how it is processed; as well as details how to report data privacy concerns or request erasure of such data. Should data be provided to a third party, such exchange is governed, and data privacy obligations outlined in a Data Processing Agreement; Data Protection Annex; or other similar agreement largely aligned to the firm\u2019s policies. \nCYBERSECURITY The firm\u2019s program is aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.\n59\nINTRODUCTION CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nEND NOTESCONCLUSION & \nLOOKING FORWARD\nDISCLOSURES", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 59, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
