Given ESG can oftenfeel abstract to management teams, we seekto simplify ESG by encouraging ourselves andour companies to set tangible, measurablegoals which can be tracked over time and wecan be held accountable to.ACTION AND PROGRESS\nIn 2021 we made significant progress implementing our ESG strategy:\nPILOTED ENHANCED  \nENGAGEMENT APPROACH\nWe developed and piloted a process to support \ncompanies in prioritizing ESG issues via an ESG materiality mapping exercise and executive debrief. We then created ESG dashboards with KPIs to track and drive progress. The ESG dashboards will help ensure that companies continue to (i) prioritize ESG issues, (ii) track KPIs in order to improve upon them over time and (iii) be held accountable by the board.\nACCELERATED DIVERSE, INCLUSIVE \nCULTURES AND SHARED PROSPERITY\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion\nWe seek to be a strategic partner on DEI as our companies build more inclusive environments and diverse teams, which we believe will help them deliver attractive performance. Our DEI strategy has two pillars:\n\u2022Board diversity:  We set an aspirational\nobjective to increase board diversity atcompanies where we have majority board-appointment rights and majority equityownership (\u201cqualifying investments\u201d). Ourgoal is to have at least two diverse boardmembers for each qualifying investmentafter one year of ownership by Q2 2022. 11\nSince setting our goal in H1 2021, ourqualifying investments have added over tendiverse directors through December 2021.\n\u2022Holistic DEI strategies:  We developed and\nexecuted on our DEI program \u201cAmpliFY DEI\u201d.  In\nearly 2021, we partnered with 11 managementteams of ACOF portfolio companies to performin-depth reviews of DEI progress and to developthree-year strategic plans with tailored KPIsat each company. With the help of a premierconsulting firm, we assessed each of thesecompany\u2019s DEI infrastructure, analyzed diversityacross seniority levels and evaluated howemployees experience inclusion with regardto diversity. This process helped our portfoliocompanies (i) establish a baseline view of DEImaturity, representation and inclusion and(ii) develop data-driven, accountability-basedstrategies to measure progress.\n\u201cOur ESG initiatives strengthen the businesses \nin which we invest and our partnerships with \nmanagement teams\u00a0\u2014 they are both a driver of \nvalue and a competitive differentiator.\u201d\nNatasha Li  \nPartner, Private Equity GroupShared prosperityCorporate Private Equity has a history of partnering with management teams to develop shared prosperity plans which provide monetary incentives to employees beyond just\u00a0the senior management teams. We believe this helps to increase the productivity and stability of businesses and decrease income inequality.
