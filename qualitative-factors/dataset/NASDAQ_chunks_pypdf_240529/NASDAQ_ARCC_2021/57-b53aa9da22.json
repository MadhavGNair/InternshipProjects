We are committed to doing business with integrity and upholding the highest standards of ethical \nand legal conduct. We have adopted a Whistleblower policy and established an ethics hotline (also \ncalled a Whistleblower Hotline) hosted by an independent third party that allows for open reporting \nor anonymous and confidential reporting, which is available to all our people globally. This supports \nour employees in coming forward with potential concerns about unethical or unlawful behavior \nby the firm or other employees. Reporting through the hotline can be done anonymously 24/7 via \nweb-based form or via dedicated local phone numbers for our offices globally (in local languages). \nIf an employee becomes aware of information regarding an actual or potential violation of Ares\u2019 \npolicies, the Whistleblower policy has an obligation to promptly transmit that information to the \nGlobal Chief Compliance Officer or General Counsel. All incidents are reviewed by the Global Chief \nCompliance Officer and escalated appropriately depending on the nature of the complaint. On an \nannual basis, all employees certify their understanding of policies and code of conduct, which \nincludes the Ethics Hotline. Through this annual certification, we seek to clearly communicate \nthat any employee who comes forward with a complaint will not be subject to retaliation as a \nresult of their reporting violations through the hotline. In addition, our external auditors review our \nWhistleblower logs at least annually.\nFN-AC-550a.1 Systemic Risk \nManagementPercentage of open-end fund assets under management by category of liquidity classification.
