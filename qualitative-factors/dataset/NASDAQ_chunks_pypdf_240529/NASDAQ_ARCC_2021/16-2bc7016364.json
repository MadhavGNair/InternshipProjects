{"page_content": "Enterprise Risk \nManagement \nOUR APPROACH\nELEVATING OUR APPROACH TO  \nBUILD BETTER SAFEGUARDS\nOur established risk management practices \ncenter on an integrated approach to identify, \nassess, and prioritize risks at the direction \nof our Enterprise Risk Committee \u201cERC\u201d. \nWe\u00a0categorize risks across operational, \nhuman\u00a0resources, legal, regulatory & \ncompliance, financial & liquidity, and \nstrategic & reputational. As we navigate \ninterdependencies and relationships between \nrisks, collaboration is imperative. Moreover, \nwith our partners in compliance, legal, audit \nand cybersecurity, we coordinate through \nan assurance forum to gain efficiencies and \ninsights across risk areas. Further, as we \nintegrate with acquisitions, select risks are \nabsorbed into our framework and re-assessed \nthrough an established cadence.ACTION AND PROGRESS\nSHARPENING OUR FOCUS  \nTHROUGH STANDARDIZATION\nA major focus for 2021 was enhancing our \nEnterprise Risk Management framework with \nrisks and controls assessed across our defined \ntaxonomy. We standardized assessment \ncriteria, including likelihood, velocity, and \nimpact scales for operational, reputational, \nregulatory, and financial categories for each \nenterprise risk. We transformed our control \nframework to convert disparate control data \ninto integrated information views across 7 \ncontrol areas and 46 control categories. As a \nresult of this standardization, we were able to \nbetter inform our mitigation strategies and \napply a risk-based approach to strengthen \ncontrols for residual business risks scoring \ninherently higher.\nRESPONDING ACROSS THE  \nRISK LANDSCAPE\nOur program construct includes establishing \ndedicated working groups to address new \nareas of risk. In 2021, we executed on working group milestones associated with LIBOR \ntransition planning related to the benchmark\u2019s \ncessation and completed governance and \noperational enhancements associated with our \ncorporate records management framework. \nWe\u00a0continued to manage risks associated with \nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including \nimpacts of returning to the office, leading \nto progressive changes to our location \ncontingency and disaster recovery approach.\nOUR FUTURE\nMEASURING WHAT MATTERS\nAs we look ahead to 2022, the main objective \nof our program will be to develop metrics \nand key indicators for top level business \nrisks to achieve greater visibility into our risk \nprofile and sharpen our risk management \nstrategies. As our risk profile changes, so must \nour approach. Shifting from assessing risks \nannually to establishing capabilities to track \nearly signals of increasing exposure informs \nour response and enables us to react more \nrapidly to changing levels.CASE STUDY\nA RISK-BASED APPROACH TO RESILIENCY\nDriven in part by the global pandemic and pace of disruptive events, we need to ensure \nwe\u00a0can protect against downside risks and limit impact to deliver on our commitments. \nFrom what we have learned through the pandemic, weather, geopolitical and cyber \ndisruptions, we aspire to be nimble and able to adapt and react quickly to changing \ncircumstances. As the firm grows, it becomes increasingly important to have established \ngovernance and escalation protocols in place, as well as insight into critical operating \nprocesses and dependencies, making us better prepared to rapidly uncover and remediate \nkey risks and\u00a0inefficiencies. At the heart of our resiliency program is the information \ncollected from our Business Impact Analysis \u201cBIA\u201d that provides visibility into our operating \necosystem and critical dependencies, allowing us to better predict the consequences \nof disruption. Bolstered by digital capabilities in 2021 we updated the firm-wide BIA, \nencompassing roughly 140 global investment operations and control processes, a 70% \nincrease in assessments from 2020. As a result, we were able to identify and prioritize \nrecovery strategies for the top 15% of the most immediately required processes and \nvisibility into 6%\u00a0of potential single points of failure areas. Against a backdrop of an evolving operational, regulatory, \nand increasingly interconnected risk environment, we \ncontinue to actively manage the spectrum of risks that \nwe confront.\nThrough our integrated Enterprise Risk Management framework, reinforced \nby our culture, governance structure and digital capabilities, we remain \nequipped to advance risk management strategies related to our operations.\n\u201cThe range of disruptive events that we have \nseen over the past few years, including global \npandemic, geopolitical and localized disruptions, \nhave demonstrated the importance of proactively \npreparing for emerging risks, ensuring we can \nreact quickly and remain resilient.\u201d\nKelly Young  \nHead of Enterprise Risk Management\n16\nINTRODUCTION RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY \n& INCLUSION CLIMATE CHANGE PHILANTHROPY CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE, \nCOMPLIANCE & ETHICSSUPPORTING & \nDEVELOPING TALENT ENTERPRISE RISK \nMANAGEMENT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
