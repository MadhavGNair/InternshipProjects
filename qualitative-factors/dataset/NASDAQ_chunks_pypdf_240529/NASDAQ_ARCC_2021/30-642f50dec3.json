{"page_content": "Real Estate Equity\nIn the Ares Real Estate Group we adopt a systematic \napproach which embeds ESG considerations into our \ninvestment process.\nWe assess ESG risks and opportunities before we acquire and identify areas we can improve \nas we manage each asset. We believe integrating these factors into our day-to-day work is \ncritical to preserving value and driving investment performance for our investors.\nOUR APPROACH\nIn Real Estate Equity our approach to ESG \nintegration has two defining elements. The first \nis that effective delivery needs the right team. \nThe second is a realization that meaningful \nchanges require both a short- and long-term \ntime horizon.\n\u2022 Our ESG Champions are a collection of \nteam members from all major functions \nof the investment process, providing a \nthoughtful approach to ESG integration.  \nThis team understands how to assess \nrisk and develop a management plan, and \nit interacts with colleagues and Senior \nLeadership regularly. ESG is fully embedded, \nnot adjacent, to what we do each day \nand this culture is in the fabric of our \ninvestment teams.\n\u2022 Our Core ESG Team understands where \nour group can have most impact.  We \nranked topics like climate change, DEI and \ntransparency in terms of their materiality and \nby how swiftly or otherwise we could make \nchanges. The result has been a near-term \nre-set of our investment process to include \nmore formal ESG considerations now, while \nadopting a multi-year plan on broader issues \nlike climate change.ACTION AND PROGRESS\nThere are two significant changes that we \nmade in 2021 which have allowed us to make \nfurther progress on our ESG journey: the rollout \nof our ESG Integration Plan and the evolution of \nour decarbonization plan.\n\u2022 An integrated ESG approach.  Our ESG \nframework was formally adopted in July \n2021, codifying new processes which our \ninvestment teams follow when assessing and \nreporting on new acquisitions.\n\u2022 Our Decarbonization Plan. Given our size, \ndecarbonization will take time and our \njourney starts with establishing an accurate \nmeasurement of the baseline carbon \nfootprint of our portfolio. Knowing this will \nhelp us establish appropriate long-term \ndecarbonization targets, and track and report \non our progress. As you see opposite this \nplan is taking shape and consumption data \ncollection is being trialed across a section \nof our portfolio, something we will expand if \nthe initial trials are successful. Part of this \nplan includes enhancing data collection \nacross a section of our portfolio, using a \ncombination of software solutions, hardware \nand enhanced data analysis to support KPI \nreporting in the future.OUR DECARBONIZATION ROADMAP\nCommence  \nEnergy \nManagement \nSoftware  \nTrials\nQ4 2021Landlord Data \nCollection\nQ2\u2013Q3 2022Gap Analysis & \nSolving\nQ3\u2013Q4 2022Energy\nEfficiencies \nShort, Medium \nand Long term\nFROM Q2 2022Set Interim\nClimate Change\nTarget\n2023INVESTMENT STRATEGIES WILL ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING PROCESS\nSOURCING\nCommenced screening on \nselect deals using the \u2018Pre-Due \nDiligence Screening Framework\u2019.DILIGENCE\nExpanded ESG screen as \npart of the due diligence \nprocess.
