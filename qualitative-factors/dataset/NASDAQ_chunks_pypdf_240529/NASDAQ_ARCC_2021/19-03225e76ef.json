As Ares is rooted in our credit business, we believe we are better \nable to draw on a long history and experience to find,  and partner with, \nbetter opportunities.OUR APPROACH\nSeeking to understand ESG risks and \nopportunities is a part of our investment strategy and is integrated into our investment approach. We believe that ESG factors help deliver downside protection, while building value and better companies for people and\u00a0the planet.\nAs a large credit investor, we see the value \nof including ESG in credit analysis and work at scale to increasingly systematize this integration. This includes our own diligence process, as well as broader engagement with sponsors where possible to understand the profile of ESG in more detail and highlight opportunities. Over the long term, we maintain regular communication, and augment this with software-based early warning tools to stay abreast of emerging ESG issues and topics.\nDELIVERING ON OUR ESG \nSTRATEGY IN 2021\nOver 2021, we have taken steps to build the \nmaturity of our program, and to draw on  \nareas of real leverage.CREDIT OVERVIEW\nAres Credit Group compromises $192.7 billion of AUM 9 and 325 investment professionals  across strategies.\nDIRECT LENDING LIQUID CREDIT ALTERNATIVE CREDIT\nAUM $135 billion $40.3 billion $19.2 billion 10\nTARGETED INVESTMENTSCashflow Loans, \nProject FinanceLeveraged Loans, \nHigh Yield BondsIlliquid Alternative Credit (private \ndirectly-originated investments) and \nLiquid Alternative Credit (CLOs, real \nestate debt securities, rated private ABS)\nNUMBER OF INVESTMENT \nPROFESSIONALS238 43 44\nNUMBER OF OFFICES 12 3 4\nNote: As of December 31, 2021. \n\u201cThis year we focused on building an embedded \nknowledge base to execute effectively on ESG. \nOur 45 credit ESG champions created the \ninfrastructure, guidance and training to set a high \nstandard for assessing and addressing ESG.\u201d\nMichael Smith  \nCo-Head of Credit GroupCULTURAL INTEGRATION\nWe expanded the ESG Champion group, \nembedding ESG deeper in our processes.
