We therefore hired a Private Equity ESG lead, Kate Macauley, in February 2021, and a DEI investment platform lead, Jamie Dunchick, in July 2021. Our ESG and DEI leads work closely with our ESG steering committee and our working group of 20+ Private Equity ESG champions. We also launched Private Equity Group-related ESG updates and ESG training for new joiners.\nFURTHER INTEGRATING ESG INTO \nOUR INVESTMENT PROCESS\nWe improved the robustness of our ESG deal \nteam-led diligence process across our Private Equity Group.

Within Corporate Private Equity, we\u00a0also piloted a new approach to ESG onboarding and engagement and built out initiatives on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Employee Health and Safety.\n24\nINTRODUCTION CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY FURTHER INFORMATION\nRESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\nCREDIT GROUP REAL ESTATE GROUP SECONDARY SOLUTIONS STRATEGIC INITIATIVESPRIVATE EQUITY GROUP", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
