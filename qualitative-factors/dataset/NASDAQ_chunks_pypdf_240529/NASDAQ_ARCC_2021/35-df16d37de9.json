{"page_content": "Conclusion & \nLooking Forward \nIn 2021, teams across Ares made a \nsynchronized pivot from reimagining their ESG vision to implementing with greater clarity and focus, all driven by a shared desire to accelerate impact. Building on the momentum generated through publishing our inaugural sustainability report, colleagues representing a broad cross-section of Ares produced the achievements recorded throughout this report while reinforcing key enablers that will be critical to long-term sustainable impact. These include cementing cultural embeddedness across our teams through a network of 120+ ESG champions and enhancing our conversations about whether we\u2019re achieving the impact we seek through more systematic data collection and analysis.\nAs we look ahead to 2022, we want to build \non our experience achieving impact to scale these efforts throughout our fast-growing platform.

Ev en \nas we advance our ESG practices against \na range of material topics, both within our \ncorporate s ustainability pr ogram a nd through \nthe investment platform, we are highly focused \non two issues where we feel especially well-\npositioned to make an impact. The first is to \nhelp catalyze a more inclusive and equitable \neconomy by supporting businesses that serve \ncommunities where everyone can thrive. The second is to drive an energy transition that \ncuts carbon while ensuring jobs and skills are increased, not lost. If we can manage scalable \nand measurable progress against these issues \nwithin our span of control, in partnership with our full range of stakeholders and partners, we believe we can help create a better alternative to existing systems.\n35\nINTRODUCTION CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nDISCLOSURES END NOTESCONCLUSION & \nLOOKING FORWARD", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
