{"page_content": "OUR FUTURE\nOur impact on communities should be long-\nlasting so that future generations reap the benefits of our support. This requires that we identify the most critical barriers to people\u2019s success and ideate scalable, sustainable solutions to help solve them. It also  \nmotivates us to innovate the kinds of answers to questions that others may not consider, which is in keeping with our entrepreneurial spirit and desire to continuously think outside of the box. We do this because we strive to support systemic change rather than devise piecemeal fixes.DISTINCTIVE GRANTMAKING\nA rigorous examination of the regions in which \nwe award grants will help us more deeply understand their specific challenges relative to our funding priorities. It will allow us to craft regional theories of change so that we can be highly responsive to communities\u2019 needs and effectively tell the story of how we address them. In addition, these efforts will enable us to develop a global philanthropic strategy that includes success measures and indicators so that we prudently assess our grantmaking strategy ongoing.\nWe will also launch a multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar signature grant initiative in 2022 to prepare people to enter climate-resilient jobs in the US and India.\nREIMAGINED EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\nAIM w ill empower l ocal c hampi ons t o \ncurate i ncreased  skills-based v olunteerism \noppo rtunities t hat r esult i n high-impact \nnonprofit service.
