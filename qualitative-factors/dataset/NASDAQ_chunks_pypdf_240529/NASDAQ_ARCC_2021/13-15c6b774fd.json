{"page_content": "Climate Change (cont.)\nLEADING BY EXAMPLE AT ARES\nLeading by example is a foundational \nelement of our approach to climate change \nacross our broader portfolio. We believe it \nis critically important to demonstrate best \npractices internally, from both a values and \noperationalization standpoint, to enhance our \nengagements with portfolio companies.\nWe are focused on reducing our per person \nCO2e footprint by expanding our corporate \nenvironmental initiatives. We prioritize \nareas\u00a0we\u00a0more directly control or influence \n(such as waste from operations, within-\noffice energy savings, travel and employee \ncommuting) and we are identifying new ways \nto support climate change goals where we \nhave less direct control given our leased office \nspaces (such as energy sources). We also seek to activate our employees to be better citizens \nthough awareness education, environmental \nvolunteerism opportunities, and benefits, such \nas our public transit pre-tax incentive program. \nFor 2021, we are offsetting twice the amount \nof our Scope 1, Scope 2 and measured Scope 3 \noperational emissions.\nThrough past measurement and offsetting \nefforts, we have developed an internal \nknowledge base on best practices, in \npartnership with external consultants. We \ncan now take and apply this knowledge set \nto\u00a0help our portfolio companies when possible \nand investment partners as they embark on \ntheir measuring and their offsetting journeys. \nWe look to continually improve our CO 2e \nfootprinting approach, taking into account the \nchanging nature of our\u00a0business over time\u00a0\u2014 for example, the increase in remote work \nassociated with our approach of providing \nemployees more flexibility. We are also \ndeepening our general environmental initiatives \nacross our offices, as we believe that driving \nclimate change improvements is fundamentally \nlinked to a broader environmental mindset.\nFUTURE INITIATIVES\nIn line with our broader environmental \nand climate change efforts, we commit to \ncontinuing to measure and report on ongoing \nScope 1, 2 and 3 categories (as noted in the \nchart) on an absolute and per headcount \nbasis,\u00a0offsetting our footprint with attention \nto\u00a0high-impact, high-quality offsets. We will \nalso\u00a0look to opportunistically incorporate \nin-suite energy savings mechanisms, where YOY TOTAL CORE EMISSIONS  \n(METRIC TONS OF CO 2e)\n12,845\nNew Scope 3 Areas \nAdded in 2021:\n\u2022  Employee \nCommuting: 705.8  \n\u2022  Remote Work: 575.1  \n\u2022  Refrigerant Gas: 46.3  \n\u2022  Transmission & \nDistribution Losses \nfrom Heating and \nElectricity: 140.2  \n\u2022  Water and \nWastewater: 4.1  \n\u2022  Waste: 40.1  \n\u2022  Airport Transfers: 83.2possible, into our office suite buildouts, \nsuch\u00a0as smart meters that help to identify \nenergy drains, automatic light shut-offs and \nHVAC system best practices.\nEMISSIONS/ACHIEVING \nCARBON NEUTRALITY\nFollowing on from our inaugural baselining \nCO2e emissions measurement for 2020 \n(Scope\u00a01, Scope 2 and business travel with \nrespect to Scope 3), for 2021, we layered in \nseveral new Scope\u00a03 categories and estimated \nour associated CO 2e footprint.\nOverall, our 2021 emissions are 64% lower \nthan our 2019 emissions (pre-COVID era), not \ntaking into account the new Scope 3 areas we \nincluded for 2021 (which are shaded grey in the \ncharts). Our 2021 emissions are 15% higher than \nour 2020 emissions (not including the new \nScope 3 areas measured).\nScope 1:  2021 is the first year where we have \nScope 1 emissions, as we now own one of our \noffice buildings. The rest of our office spaces \nare leased. Scope 1 represents only .8% of our \nemissions profile.\nScope 2:  On an absolute basis, our Scope\u00a02 \nemissions have increased year over year, driven \nby an expanding office footprint associated \nwith firm growth. In 2019, we had 18 offices, \ngrowing to 27 offices in 2020 and 47 offices in \n2021. On a per headcount basis, our Scope\u00a02 \nlevels decreased slightly year over year, which is \ndirectionally consistent with our efforts to drive \nmore in-suite energy efficiencies.SPOTLIGHT\nLEED BUILDINGS\nThe majority of our larger offices are LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) \nor BREEAM (Building Research Establishments Environmental Assessment Method) \ncertified, including New York, Los Angeles (Century City), London, and Denver, as well as six \nother smaller locations. We seek to increase our number and percentage of BREEAM and \nLEED certified properties as we select future spaces.\u00a0\n67%Percentage of major offices  \n(over 200 employees) that are  \nLEED or BREEAM certified.\nScope 3:  This year, we added several additional \nScope 3 areas, the total impact of which is \ncaptured in the grey shaded chart area. Our \nScope 3 emissions decreased 80% vs 2019 \nand 2% vs 2020 (not including the added \nscope areas). This is almost entirely driven \nby lower rates of business travel on account \nof pandemic and post-pandemic travel \npractices. We anticipate that future years \nwill see an uptick in business travel, though \nwe expect there will be some permanent \ndiminution of long-term travel emissions on \na per headcount basis (compared to 2019 \nlevels) due to availability and acceptance of \nvirtual\u00a0alternatives.YOY EMISSIONS PER EMPLOYEE  \n(METRIC TONS OF CO 2e)\n2019 2020 202110.29\n2.75\n0.220.748.73\n1.531.01\n1.561.221.10 Scope 1\n Scope 2\n Scope 3\n  Scope 3  \nAdditional measured areas for 2021\n2.33\nScope 3 Areas \nMeasured in \nPrior Years2019 2020 20214,0176,206\n1,595\n4,611\n13\nINTRODUCTION RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY \n& INCLUSION PHILANTHROPY CYBERSECURITY ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENTGOVERNANCE, COMPLIANCE & ETHICSSUPPORTING & DEVELOPING TALENT CLIMATE CHANGE ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
