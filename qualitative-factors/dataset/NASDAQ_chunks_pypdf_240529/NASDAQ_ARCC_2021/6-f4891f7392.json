{"page_content": "EXECUTING AT SCALE\nOur firm grew AUM from $197 billion at the \nend of 2020 to $306 billion at the end of 2021. \nWe made two transformational acquisitions \nand expanded our employee base from \napproximately 1,450 to more than 2,100 \nprofessionals. The significant growth makes \nour distributed ownership model for corporate \nsustainability even more critical. It is now an \nimperative to systematically and intentionally \nbring together different voices from across the \nfirm on our sustainability initiatives. OUR APPROACH\nWe aim to first implement leading \nsustainability practices within our own \noperations. As our firm continues to scale, we \nare expanding our Corporate Sustainability \ninitiatives across a larger employee base \nand operational footprint. This requires us \nto prioritize against and within our seven \nmaterial corporate sustainability ESG topics \nand to have clear ownership, goal setting, and \naccountability. We have dedicated Corporate \nSustainability champions across the relevant \ninternal functions, who are responsible for \nobjective setting and execution, in partnership \nand with guidance from our ESG team. We \nthen seek to share what we\u2019ve learned across \nour growing sphere of influence within the \ninvestment platform.Corporate \nSustainability \nWe are committed to leading by example in our corporate \nsustainability practices.\nWe have great reach through our investment portfolios across thousands of assets and \ncompanies, as well as hundreds of financial sponsor partners. We have an opportunity to \nengage with many organizations on sustainability given these relationships and partnerships. \nTo most effectively engage, we must be humble in acknowledging that we are on an ESG \njourney within our own operations while simultaneously setting a high standard for leading \nsustainability practices.2021 HIGHLIGHTS\nA YEAR OF REMARKABLE \nPROGRESS\nThe past year was a test of resilience\u00a0\u2014 \nour firm and employees navigated a \nworld in flux given the unpredictable \nnature of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nWe collaborated to drive forward \nour business and our sustainability \ninitiatives while adapting to changing \nwork environments and guidelines.

LEADING BY EXAMPLE\u00a0\u2014  \nFROM THEORY TO PRACTICE\nDrawing on our established corporate \nsustainability best practices, we have \nsought\u00a0to activate our stakeholders to \namplify our impact.
