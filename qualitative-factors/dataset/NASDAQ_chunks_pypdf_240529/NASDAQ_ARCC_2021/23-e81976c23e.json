{"page_content": "Alternative Credit\nOUR APPROACH\nOur strategy pursues investments across a \ndiverse range of asset profiles, and the team has established specific ESG considerations to identify risks and benefits. An ESG risk assessment is conducted for potential investments at the initial screening phase, which is then refined during our due diligence phase, with ESG findings presented to investment committees prior to execution. Transactions may be declined for ESG reasons throughout the deal process with borderline cases typically discussed with the team\u2019s ESG Champions and senior leaders.\nACTION AND PROGRESS\nThroughout 2021, we saw continued progress in our markets toward improved ESG standards. Specific areas of ongoing progress include (i) working with existing counterparties to receive robust ESG data related to the underlying assets, (ii) standardizing methodologies to account for ESG-specific criteria and objectives, and (iii) improved tracking and reporting of ESG data for both new and legacy investments.\nCulturally, we believe a strong investing with \npurpose ethos has developed within Alternative Credit, driven in large part by the charitable tie-in within our flagship commingled funds, \nAres P athfinder F und a nd a lternative c redit  \nopen-end c ore fund. At least 10% of Ares \nPathfinder Fund\u2019s carried interest and at least \n5% of alternative credit open-end core fund \nincentive f ees w ill be donated t o  suppo rt \nhealth and education charities.

To that end, \nw\ne\u00a0have the following goals:\n\u2022To agree upon ESG KPIs to be measured\nand reported to investors  which are readily\nobtainable from transparent data.\n\u2022Continuous improvement and increasedawareness  through ESG training and\ncommunication.\n\u2022To evaluate green, social or sustainability-linked investments  that fit our broader\ninvestment criteria.\n\u201cOur ESG efforts hold us equally accountable \nto\u00a0each other as a team of investors with diverse \nbackgrounds from different communities, as \nmuch as to our diverse client\u00a0base.\u201d\nLisa Trolson   \nManaging Director, Alternative Credit\nAlternative Credit investments are characterized by \ndiverse pools of assets which may be either purchased or financed through a variety of different financial instruments across both public and private markets.\nOur Alternative Credit platform manages ~$19.2\u00a0billion across liquid \n(tradeable) and illiquid (directly originated) alternative credit investments.
