SPOTLIGHT\nBREAKING NEW GROUNDS WITH SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED LOANS\nNew ground was broken this year as funds managed by our Direct Lending strategy served as \nthe sole lenders of \u00a31 billion of available debt facilities to RSK Group, the UK\u2019s largest privately-owned, multi-disciplinary environmental business. At the time of announcement, the transaction marked the largest private credit-backed sustainability-linked financing to date. The debt facility includes an annual margin review based on the achievement of sustainability targets, which are broadly focused on carbon intensity reduction and continual improvement to health and safety management and ethics. These targets are aligned to RSK\u2019s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Route Map, which forms the basis of its sustainability strategy, based on RSK\u2019s sustainability pillars and the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. RSK could achieve interest savings in excess of \u00a3500,000 per year based on its performance against these targets, and it has committed to donate a minimum of 50% of this margin benefit toward sustainability-related initiatives or charitable causes.\n\u201cAs responsible ESG investment and rigor around ESG underwriting rapidly becomes table \nstakes within the Direct Lending market, it is critical that we build upon the great work \ncompleted during 2020\u20132021 and further embed ESG within our business into 2022 and \nbeyond. We are in a position of influence as one of the largest direct lenders.\u201d\nCarl Helander  \nPartner, Credit Group\n\u201cWe are excited to continue to grow our longstanding relationship with RSK through this \nsignificant financing that is a first for both of our businesses and further connects us to a shared sustainability commitment. With demand for sustainability-linked loans continuing to \ngrow, Ares is proud to be at the forefront of this landmark transaction which we expect to serve \nas a model example of how we can help our clients achieve their ESG goals and objectives.\u201d\nMichael Dennis  \nCo-Head of Ares European Direct Lending\n21\nINTRODUCTION CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY FURTHER INFORMATION\nRESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT\nREAL ESTATE GROUP SECONDARY SOLUTIONS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPCREDIT GROUP ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
