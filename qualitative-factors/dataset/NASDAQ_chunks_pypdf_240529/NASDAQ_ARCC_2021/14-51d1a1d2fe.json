{"page_content": "Governance, \nCompliance \n& Ethics\nCASE STUDY\nARES, A PUBLIC COMPANY  \nWITH AN INDEPENDENT  \nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nIn 2021, we took a key step in our \ngovernance journey toward achieving \na majority independent Board of \nDirectors. Eileen Naughton joined \nour Board of Directors, establishing a \n50/50 independent Board structure. \nWe believe that her significant \nbusiness management experience \nnavigating international markets while \nbuilding and preserving a diverse and \ninclusive culture will prove a valuable \nasset to Ares. Our Board of Directors \nhas been expanded to 11 members, \nincluding five independent directors \nand one vacancy, which the Board will \nseek to fill in 2022 with an additional \nindependent director, resulting in our \nBoard being majority independent. \nThe change supplements our existing, \nwell-developed governance framework \nand builds on the success of our \nexpansion in 2021 of the Executive \nManagement Committee to a total \nof 17 members, representing senior \nleaders with different backgrounds \nand experiences from across our \nbusinesses and geographies, spanning \nthe investment and non-investment \nfunctions of our platform.Ares is guided by shared values and a commitment to \ncreating a culture where we hold ourselves to the highest \nethical standards.\nEthical corporate governance is fundamental to safeguarding our \nbusiness and ensuring alignment of interest with our stakeholders. Our \nBoard of Directors and senior management have implemented policies \nand practices that are designed to support sustained value creation, \nwith a focus on our fiduciary responsibilities and our role as trustworthy \nstewards of capital.\nAres\u2019 dedication to a firm-wide culture of compliance and our robust \ncompliance program provide employees with the tools and resources to \nadhere to our regulatory requirements while instilling the importance of \nintegrity, ownership and professionalism in our business dealings. OUR APPROACH\nMaintaining client trust is core to our business \napproach, which is why Ares stresses high \nethical standards and corresponding behavior. \nOur multi-pronged approach is principles-\nbased: honest and ethical conduct, compliance \nwith laws and regulations, adherence to policies \nand procedures and attention to circumstances \nthat may give rise to conflicts of interest.\nThis tone is set by our most senior management, \nwhile legal and compliance teams are responsible \nfor incorporating and promoting awareness of \nlegal, regulatory and ethical standards across \nour investment and non-investment groups. This \ndistinctive culture\u00a0\u2014 a shared commitment to \nthe core values of responsibility and principled \nbehavior\u00a0\u2014 is one of our best assets, and this \nis paramount when contemplating adding a \nnew business group, considering expansion or \nselecting new employees to join Ares.\nACTION AND PROGRESS\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION\nIn 2021, our Board of Directors moved toward \na majority-independent board by forming the \nNominating and Governance Committee. The \ncommittee is responsible for developing and \nrecommending policies regarding qualifications \nfor director nominees, director selection and \nevaluation to ensure representation from \ndiverse and independent backgrounds. The \nCommittee also has a duty to periodically \nreview our corporate governance guidelines, \npolicies relating to corporate governance, and \nto recommend any changes in\u00a0such policies to \nour Board of Directors.\nCORPORATE ACQUISITIONS AND \nEMPLOYEE INTEGRATION\nOnboarding new businesses requires training \nand integration procedures both at the time of acquisition and as recurring quarterly \ncertifications for all employees. In 2021, \n99.99% of the almost 9,000 certifications \nwere administered and completed in a timely \nmanner by our employees, including 499 who \njoined from acquired businesses.\nPORTFOLIO COMPANY GOVERNANCE\nIn 2021, Ares undertook a review of the \ncontrolled portfolio companies of two core \nbusiness groups, Ares SSG and Private Equity, \nevaluating such companies for compliance \nwith the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) \nand other anti-corruption laws.\nOUR FUTURE\nWith the proliferation of new regulations \nproposed by the SEC in 2021 and 2022, we are \nactively monitoring the proposals and ensuring \nappropriate training, implementation and \ncompliance across our firm of the final rules. \nIn-depth reviews of our controlled portfolio \ncompanies\u2019 compliance with FCPA and other \nanti-corruption laws are an important part \nof our governance procedures. In 2022, we \nplan to continue our review of our Real Estate \nand Credit portfolios to ensure continued \ncompliance with such laws. These reviews \nwill supplement our existing processes for \ncompliance with US Department of Treasury \nregulations and sanctions programs.\nEVERGREEN GLOBAL COMPLIANCE\nPolicies and procedures will continue to \nbe refreshed to incorporate changes to \nregulations and introduction of new laws. We \ncombine required changes with an earnest \nevaluation of new or expanded business \nactivities to determine if enhancements to \nour policies or procedures are required. This is \nvital to sustaining the culture of compliance \nand ensuring appropriate and ethical \nbusiness activities.\n\u201cWe value and depend on the trust our clients \nplace in us, and that trust remains our priority \nthrough our daily decision-making and \ntransparent business actions.\u201d\nNaseem Sagati Aghili  \nGeneral Counsel and Secretary\n14\nINTRODUCTION RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FURTHER INFORMATION\nCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY \n& INCLUSION CLIMATE CHANGE PHILANTHROPY CYBERSECURITY ENTERPRISE RISK \nMANAGEMENTSUPPORTING & \nDEVELOPING TALENT GOVERNANCE, \nCOMPLIANCE & ETHICS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCC_2021.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
