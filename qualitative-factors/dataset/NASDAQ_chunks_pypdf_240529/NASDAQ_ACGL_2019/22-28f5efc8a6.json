All rights reserved. 2019 Arch Sustainability Report   |  23Our Corporate Giving Strategy: Housing, \nHealth and Education\nArch focuses on three core \ncommunity impact categories for \ncorporate giving: housing, health \nand education. We view all three \nas critical areas where we can \nproductively contribute to long \nterm community growth and \nresiliency. We believe that more inclusive \nand well-funded education, health and \nhousing systems are essential to successful \nand sustainable community development. Supporting Housing\nBeyond the intrinsic support we deliver to the housing \nmarket through our Mortgage Insurance business \nsolutions (see \u201cEnabling Access to Housing and Related \nMortgage Programs\u201d for more information), we also \nsupport housing through our corporate giving strategy.\nCommunity Housing Solutions \nArch is proud to partner with Community Housing \nSolutions (CHS), an organization that improves \nneighborhoods by providing home repairs to Guilford \nCounty, North Carolina low-income homeowners. With a \nskilled construction staff and volunteer groups from the \ncommunity, this organization works with homeowners \nwho fall below specific income levels to address needed \nhome repairs. The repairs enable the homeowners to \nlive in a secure place and a home that is warmer, drier \nand safer. \nIn 2019, 34 Arch \nvolunteers  provided 276 \nhours  of labor to help the \nCHS construction team \nrebuild homes and restore \nhope in Guilford County, NC.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACGL_2019.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
