All rights reserved. 2019 Arch Sustainability Report   |  48Blue Goes Green\u2019s first initiative is \nto eliminate single-use plastic water \nbottles in our offices. After surveying \nour offices in 2019 about their \nsingle-use water bottle habits, it was \ndetermined that in 2018 we spent \napproximately $113,000 on single-use \nplastic water bottles, which equates to approximately \n375,000 bottles. Recognizing this unnecessary waste \nand the harm the plastic causes our oceans and wildlife, \nthe committee put a plan into action to replace the \nplastic water bottles with draft water dispensers in \noffice pantries. The water dispensers eliminate the need \nfor plastic water bottle deliveries, reducing the carbon \nemissions for the delivery vehicles. Branded sustainable \nwater bottles are being distributed to our employees to \nfacilitate the transition.\nIn addition, the committee will focus on other \noperational efficiencies by introducing more sustainable \npantry practices and supplies, improving recycling \nefforts, reducing paper usage, reducing travel and \nencouraging video conferencing where appropriate.Energy Efficient Offices\nOur sustainability committee also works with our head \nof global real estate and the facilities team to identify \nways to operate more responsibly and reduce our \nenvironmental impact. Facilities has prioritized looking \nfor new office space in LEED-certified and Energy Star\u00ae \nbuildings when considering new leaseholds. The team \nis also committed to designing energy efficient office \nplans with energy efficient equipment and LED lighting \nand working with sustainable suppliers for greener \nbuildout materials. \n22%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ACGL_2019.pdf", "page": 47, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
