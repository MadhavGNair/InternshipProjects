The program was launched in 2007 and is \navailable to more than 3,600 employees worldwide \n(approximately 85% of our workforce). Participants \ngain the ability to be part of Arch\u2019s future success, as it \naligns our employees\u2019 interests with our shareholders\u2019 \ninterests.\nThe ESPP has consecutive 6-month offering periods. \nParticipants purchase shares at the end of the offering \nperiod at 85% of the trading price at the beginning of the \noffering period (\u201cdiscount price\u201d). Parental Leave Policy\nArch provides a flexible parental leave policy designed \nto give new mothers and fathers paid time off to \nadjust to all that comes with having a new child or the \nplacement of a child in connection with an adoption or \nfoster care. \nParental leave is compensated at 100% of the \nemployee\u2019s regular base pay rate and leave periods vary \nby region. For example, in the U.S., eligible employees \nwill receive a maximum of 10 weeks of parental leave \nper birth, adoption or placement of a child/children in a \nrolling 6-month period.\nDuring the 2019 \noffering periods, our \nemployees were able \nto purchase shares \nwith an aggregate \nvalue of approximately \n$20 million  for an \naggregate purchase \nprice of approximately \n$14 million .\nDuring the first offering \nperiod of 2018, the fair \nmarket value of the \nstock fell below the \ndiscount price. Shares \nwere not purchased \nand the employees\u2019 \ncontributions were \nreturned to them.
