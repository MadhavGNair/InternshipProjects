Down \npayments are usually the biggest obstacle for these \nwould-be homeowners. Through one of our innovative \nmortgage insurance programs, we make it possible \nfor eligible Community Heroes to get mortgages with \nmodest down payments \u2014 as low as 0\u20131% \u2014 in the \nlocalities where they work. We\u2019re proud that we can \nhelp everyday heroes become homeowners right in the \nneighborhoods that they support and protect.\nFirst-Time Homebuyer Initiatives\nOur interest in facilitating first-time homeownership \nisn\u2019t limited to helping Community Heroes. Millions of \npeople use mortgage insurance every year, including \nprivate MI, FHA (U.S. Federal Housing Administration) \nand VA (Veteran Affairs): It\u2019s an important factor \nin making home purchases possible for first-time homebuyers, low- to moderate-income borrowers and \nminority and immigrant borrowers.\nMost lenders require a 20% down payment for a home \nloan, which is the single biggest obstacle prospective \nhomebuyers face. Our residential mortgage insurance \nsolutions give lenders the flexibility to significantly \nreduce the financial barriers to buying a home. With \nmortgage insurance, families and individuals who can \nonly budget for small down payments are still able to \npurchase homes.\nWe\u2019re an approved MI provider for Fannie Mae\u2019s \nHomeReady\u00ae and Freddie Mac\u2019s Home Possible\u00ae. These \nfederally sponsored affordable loan programs offer \nlow- and moderate-income borrowers the opportunity \nto become first-time homebuyers and begin to build a \nstronger foundation of economic security.
