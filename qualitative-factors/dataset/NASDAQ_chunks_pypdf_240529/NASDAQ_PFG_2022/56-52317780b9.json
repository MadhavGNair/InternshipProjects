{"page_content": "Scope 3 GHG emissions31\nWe measure and report our scope \n3 GHG emissions from purchased \ngoods and services, fuel and energy-\nrelated activities (not included in \nscope 1 or 2), waste generated \nin operations, business travel, \nemployee commuting, upstream \nleased assets, and downstream \nleased assets.\nThe challenge\n31 Scope 3 GHG emissions data for FY2021 \ncan be found in the 2022 CDP. 2022 data \nwill be verified in Q3 2023, and final \nfigures disclosed in the 2023 CDP.\nOur energy and sustainability program \nhas led to great results, demonstrated \nby our progress against our 2019 \nbaseline year. On average, our annual \nglidepath goal is to achieve a 4.3% \nreduction in global scope 1 and \nmarket-based scope 2 GHG emissions. \nWe didn\u2019t meet our glidepath reduction \ngoal between 2021 and 2022, but \nwe\u2019re pleased with our longer-term \nperformance and are still on track  \nto meet our 2034 and 2050 goals. \nOn average, since 2019 we\u2019ve reduced \nGHG emissions 10.1% each year, \nexceeding the annual reduction \nglidepath target of 4.3%. We\u2019ve \nachieved our 2022 target against our \n2019 baseline with a 30.3% reduction  \nin scope 1 and 2 emissions.\nIn 2022, we upgraded the lighting \nfixtures in two parking ramps at our \nworld headquarters to LEDs with \nadvanced sensors and controls. \nThe annual GHG emissions reduction \nfrom these two projects is estimated  \nto be over 500 mtCO 2e.Managing climate impact continued\n30.3%\nreduction in scope 1 and 2 \nemissions\u20142022 target achieved \nagainst our 2019 baseline Increasing building occupancy \nmeans more energy usage\nOur U.S. scope 1 and market-\nbased scope 2 GHG emissions \nrepresent nearly 80% of our \nglobal emissions. While our U.S. \nGHG emissions decreased by 2.2% \nfrom 2021 to 2022, our global \nGHG emissions increased by 4.7% \nover that same period. In 2020, \nremote working contributed to \nour reduction in scope 1 and \n2 GHG emissions. However, as \ncountries start to recover from \nthe pandemic during the past \nyear, more Principal employees \nreturned to offices. The increased \nbuilding occupancy increased our \n2022 global energy consumption \nand GHG emissions in comparison \nto the previous reporting period. \nTo help manage this impact going \nforward, we\u2019re continuing to focus \non data collection and analysis \nfor our international offices to \nidentify opportunities for energy \nconservation and renewable energy.In December, Principal maintained \n\u2018Management\u2019 status for environmental \nstewardship from CDP, after receiving a \nB rating on its 2022 CDP Climate Change \nReport, based on 2021 data. \nOur B rating is higher than the Global \naverage (C), North American Regional \naverage (C), and the Financial Services \nsector average (B-).
