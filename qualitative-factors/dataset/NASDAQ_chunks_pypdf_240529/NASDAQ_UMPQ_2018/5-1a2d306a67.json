At Umpqua, we believe we have both the obligation and opportunity to help make that relationship as good as it can be\u2014both through innovative banking and by helping our communities thrive. \nOver the past 66 years, we\u2019ve strived \nto build on our history, deepening the connection between our business and communities up and down the West Coast. Today, we\u2019re the largest bank headquartered in the Pacifc Northwest and one of the largest regional banks on the West Coast, with nearly 4,000 associates and more than $25 billion in assets. We\u2019ve developed a unique business strategy\u2014human digital banking\u2014that uses technology not just to create efciency but also to empower deeper human relationships. \nAs we\u2019re modernizing our company \nto deliver human digital banking, we\u2019ve also evolved and expanded our approach to corporate responsibility. We\u2019re dedicated to integrating our values across the organization, leveraging all parts of our company\u2014 our fnancial muscle, operational scale and institutional strengths\u2014to create value for our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. \nThis approach to corporate \nresponsibility refects our ongoing desire to make a meaningful diference in the fnancial well-being of our communities. It\u2019s work that runs deep in Umpqua\u2019s DNA, and you\u2019ll see examples of how we\u2019re working to take it to the next level throughout this report\u2014from investing in training and development for our associates to building a more diverse and inclusive organization and creating new programs to connect our teams\u2019 expertise with those in our communities who need it most.  \nWe\u2019re also doubling down on our \neforts to streamline operations in the name of sustainability and bring real human connection to digital banking. And we\u2019re sharing our approach to corporate responsibility as a guide to how we integrate our values across the organization. \nOur corporate responsibility strategy \nserves as a steward of our good intentions\u2014a framework for deepening the connection between our business and stakeholders. It includes four pillars: Support Communities, Serve Customers, Operate Sustainably and Do Meaningful Work. In this report, you\u2019ll see how we think about these pillars and how we\u2019re using them to deliver an even more signifcant impact across our communities in the future. \nFor example, last year, we launched \nUmpqua Go-To, the industry\u2019s frst human digital banking platform, which gives each of our customers instant access to their own personal banker regardless of the size of their balance. We donated more than 48,000 volunteer hours and more than $3.4 million dollars to support our communities. We streamlined operations, planted the seeds for a Sustainability Council and improved our diversity numbers. It\u2019s important and exciting progress. \nWe also recognize that the issues we\u2019re \ntackling are big and complex, and we approach this journey with humility. We have a lot to learn and a long way to go\u2014and can\u2019t do it alone. As we strive to be great, we challenge ourselves to recognize how and where we can get even better along the way. \nWe\u2019re proud of where we come from and \nlook forward to where we\u2019re going. As our journey unfolds, we will continue to reinvent and innovate how we operate, serve and give with a goal of contributing meaningfully to the long-term well-being of those we serve. \nSincerely, \nCort O\u2019Haver \nPresident and CEO \n2018 Corporate Responsibility Report\n6 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_UMPQ_2018.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
