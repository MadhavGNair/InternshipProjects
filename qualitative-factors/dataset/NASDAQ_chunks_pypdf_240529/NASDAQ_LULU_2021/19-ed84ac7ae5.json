We believe \nin cultivating leaders within lululemon who also promote \nbetterment in the world. We foster an environment where \nour employees have equitable access to opportunities, are \npaid equitably, and feel their wellbeing is supported. We \nare striving to create an inclusive work environment so \neveryone feels respected and valued. Through our employee \nleadership programs and support programs, we are creating an \norganization where each leader has the power to find and fulfill \ntheir unique purpose and contribute to a healthy future.\nLeadership\nWe invest in people to uncover and appreciate their unique \nstrengths. We offer many types of learning that are accessible \nto all full-time, part-time, and fixed-term employees. \nBelow are a few of the highlights from 2021:\n\u2022 Through the lululemon Mentorship program, we\u2019re supporting \nour people, building their knowledge, growing their careers, \nand strengthening inclusive leadership skills. In 2021, 429 \nmentees and mentors signed up for the program. 55 percent \nof mentees and 25 percent of mentors self-identified as part \nof an underrepresented group.\n\u2022 We offered a new Leader Series to nurture and grow inclusive \nleaders for a better world. Cohorts were delivered in six \nlanguages. In 2021, over 1,200 employees (representing \n89\u00a0percent of our people managers) attended the \nLeader\u00a0Series. \n\u2022 In 2021, over 5,500 employees attended leadership training \nprograms, including a new 1x1 coaching program, an \nExecOnline Learning Platform, a Business Acumen\u00a0program, \nand our global lululemon Leadership Summit.\n\u2022 We continue to provide ongoing culture offerings, which \ninclude monthly skill-builders tied to our Values in Action, \nPurpose, Vision & Goals, and Practice of Leadership. It\u2019s challenging to measure the exact number of hours of \npaid training for all our employees. We do know that as \nof 2021, our Educators in North America (representing \napproximately 17,000\u00a0out of our 29,000 global workforce) \nreceived a minimum of 13.5\u00a0hours of training. This included \nan eight-hour paid VALUES Day (Volunteer, Awareness, \nLife, Unity, Empowerment, Support), so they can take time \noff for activities such as volunteering, observance, and self-\nreflection. Educators also got a minimum of 5.5 hours per \nyear dedicated to personal and professional development. \nWhile many other employees may receive more training, we \nare using 13.5 hours as our conservative 2021 baseline. In \n2022, we launched lululemonU, an online learning portal for \nall\u00a0employees. This will expand training for all employees, \nhelping us meet our 2025 goal of 40 hours. Moving\u00a0forward, \nwe\u00a0will continue to improve our measurement and monitoring \nof global\u00a0development\u00a0opportunities.WHY IT MATTERS\nEmpowered employees are central to our culture, values, and \nbusiness success. They help us achieve sustainable, inclusive \nbusiness growth and stay resilient to change. They also help \nus ensure we remain innovative and at the forefront of our \nindustry to best support our guests and future generations. \nWhen we invest in leadership and develop opportunities for \nour\u00a0employees, we are investing in our business success.\nSDG 5.
