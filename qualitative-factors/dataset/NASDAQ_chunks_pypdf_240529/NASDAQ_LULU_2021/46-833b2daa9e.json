Nylon makes up \nthe biggest portion of our materials and provides lululemon \nproducts with the characteristically unique performance, feel, \nand quality we have become known for. Our goal is to transition \nfrom virgin nylon fibre to 100 percent renewable, recycled, or \nnet new fibres that reduce our dependence on fossil fuels while \nmaintaining uncompromising feel and performance. \nOur initial approach is to innovate into renewable bio-nylon \nat scale. We have a multi-year collaboration with Genomatica, \na\u00a0leader in biotech innovation and materials, to bring renewably \nsourced, biobased materials into our product lines, including \nlower-impact, plant-based nylon. We are collaborating with \nGenomatica on plant source and traceability to optimize \nthe overall environmental benefits from plant-based nylon. \nWe are developing the technology and working toward \ncommercialization at scale, to help achieve our 2030  \nproduct goals.\nRecycled nylon (generally made from post-industrial material \nwaste) is another option. However, recycled alternatives that \nalign with our product performance standards are currently \nonly available in limited quantities. We will scale through \nexisting and emerging solutions, such as textile-to-textile \nrecycling. We are exploring environmental impact reductions \nin other areas of the nylon value chain, including solution dye \nfinishes, manufacturing, and facility improvements. \nBaseline Year Baseline 2021 Results Goal Goal Year\n2020 2% 6% 100% 2030% renewable or recycled content nylon\n*kgs in \u2018000s\n47\n LULULEMON 2021 IMPACT REPORT Introduction   Be Human   Be Well   Be Planet   Supplement\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LULU_2021.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
