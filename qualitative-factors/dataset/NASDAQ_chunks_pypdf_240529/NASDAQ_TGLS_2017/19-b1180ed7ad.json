{"page_content": "Considering this context, in September of 2015, the Company started up the first production plant for glass \nwith low-e (low emissivity) coating in Colombia called Solartec, with an installed capacity of more than two \nmillion square meters per year and with an investment of 45 million dollars. In 2017, the volume of sales of \nlow-e coated glasses amounted to more than 79 thousand millions pesos.\nThis plant is also the first plant that uses the \u201cMagnetron Sputter Vacuum Deposition\u201d technology to deposit \nlayers of nanometric thickness in the glass (technology used for manufacturing microchips, hard disks and \nsolar panels), positioning Tecnoglass as a pioneer in the new industrial-technological developments of the \ncountry and in Latin America in general.\nToday the glasses with low emissivity coatings manufactured at this plant help to reduce the dependence of \nColombia on imports of these materials and directly contribute to the national purpose of more energetically \nefficient constructions. On the other hand, the Solartec products are exported to the United States, Panam\u00e1, \nCosta Rica, Chile and other Countries of the Region.20Leading eco-efficiency and innovation\nHighlight\ninitiatives", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TGLS_2017.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
