For instance, the a pplied a eris\u2122-G pre-pump plasma \nabatement solution, with more than 1,000 customer installations, uses less energy treating  \nthe actual process gas volume, a smaller and more concentrated volume than what is treated \nby post-pump abatement units. t he plasma dissociation, combined with the low volume of \nnitrogen in the a eris-G chamber during abatement, reduces nitrogen oxide emissions to near \nzero. t he product also saves subfab space, reduces utility and exhaust connections and \nminimizes installation costs, while improving abatement efficiency. u nits are synchronized \nwith chamber operation and operate on-demand to lower electricity usage and reduce the cost of ownership.\napplied has a long history of supporting employee programs that help reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. s ome of these programs include: carpool/ride-matching and vanpool service \nfor c alifornia, t exas and Massachusetts employees; public and alternative transportation \nincentives for c alifornia employees; electrical vehicle charging stations at our s anta c lara \nand s unnyvale campuses and a ustin site; and preferred parking for carpools, hybrid and \nelectric vehicles in a ustin and s anta c lara. \napplied continues to offer its Work-From- home ( applied anywhere) program with 417  \nparticipants and 18 telepresence rooms for virtual meetings.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2015.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
