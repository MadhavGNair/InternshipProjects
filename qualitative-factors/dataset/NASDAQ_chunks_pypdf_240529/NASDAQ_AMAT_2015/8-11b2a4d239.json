The Austin \nIndustrial Waste Neutralization (IWN) Program, launched in September, 2015, is set to have a substantial future impact on water usage\u2014a savings of approximately 16,000 gallons of water per day, or 6 million gallons per year. Its positive environmental impact was recognized by the City of Austin for Excellence in Water  Conservation in 2015.\nPrior to the IWN program, the Austin wet tool \nmanufacturing operations tested waste distilled water and used reverse osmosis to neutralize the water and then discharged it to the City of Austin publically-owned treatment works (POTW).  \nThe IWN reclamation program reuses treated \nindustrial waste water in the cooling towers  \nat the Austin manufacturing facility as make-up water. Each gallon of reclaimed IWN waste water added to the cooling towers for make-up directly replaces clean city water that would otherwise have been used. Excess volumes of reclaimed waste water continue to flow through the lift station to the City of Austin POTW.\nDuring the cooler months, the recycled waste \nwater is expected to provide over 90 percent of the total cooling tower make-up water and will augment the original make-up water source during hotter months.
