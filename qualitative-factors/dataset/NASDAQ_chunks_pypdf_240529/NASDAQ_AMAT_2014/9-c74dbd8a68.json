In 2014, our electricity usage \nincreased and natural gas usage was  unchanged from 2013. The company\u2019s total \nGhG emissions were reduced by approxi -\nmately three percent due to a decrease in \nthe equipment process emissions. Scope 3 \nemissions air travel increased approximately \n10 percent due to international travel in support of business initiatives.\nThe table below shows Applied\u2019s world -\nwide direct and indirect Gh G emissions for \nthe last three years (MT ce=metric tons of \ncarbon equivalent).In 2014, a number of energy conservation \nprojects were completed to reduce Gh G. \nPrograms included replacing inefficient  \nexterior lighting with LED lighting at  \nApplied\u2019s Santa c lara Bowers and Scott \ncampuses, and reducing power require-ments by half through optimized computer air conditioning at the Singapore Data  \ncenter. The G hG reduction from these \nprojects as measured by our ESS is esti -\nmated to be greater than 430 metric tons \nof co2e.\nAdditionally, examples of the many  \nongoing programs to help reduce green -\nhouse gas emissions include: carpool/  \nride-matching service for c alifornia,  Texas and Massachusetts employees; \npublic and alternative transportation  \nincentives for c alifornia employees;  \nelectrical vehicle charging stations at our Santa c lara and Sunnyvale c ampuses;  \nand preferred parking for carpool and  \nhybrid vehicles. The company also  \nsponsors Solar Education Workshops for \nU.S. employees to learn about discount \nincentives for installing solar energy power in their homes.\nApplied also offers its Work- from- home \n(AppliedAnywhere) program with 343 \nparticipants worldwide. The company also \nhas 14 virtual meeting telepresence rooms, enabling employees in multiple locations to \nmeet via telepresence.\n1  Excluding 650,000 square feet of leased office facilities for comparison to prior years, 2013 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GhG \nwas 181,591 MT ce, representing a 2.5% decrease from 2012.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2014.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
