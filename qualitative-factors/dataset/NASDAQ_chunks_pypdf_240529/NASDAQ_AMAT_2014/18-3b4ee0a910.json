In 2014, more than 4,000 \nemployees completed the introductory \nweb-based class and over 2,400 engineer -\ning, marketing and leadership employees \nfinished the advanced in-class training. \n\u2022\tCustomer Engagement Engine ( CEE): \nThe goal of this program is to strengthen our customer-facing organization, further \nbringing the \u201cthe voice of the customer\u201d into Applied to contribute to product \nroadmaps and help solve customers\u2019  \nhigh value problems. In 2014, the rigorous, three-day workshop was attended by more \nthan 520 sales and business development \nemployees, who also became certified in the Applied Sales Process.\n\u2022\tExecutive l eadership Series (ElS):   \nDesigned to enhance Applied leadership skills across the different business and functional organizations, the six-module program spans 12 days and is customized for its participants by Applied executive \nleaders and company subject matter \nexperts.

Employees are able to manage and track their performance and development  activities, and share work experience, skills and career interests on a single webpage \nlocation. This \u201cprofessional profile\u201d in \nWorkday enhances employees\u2019 visibility for consideration of internal job opportunities \nand also helps Applied\u2019s human resources \nteam understand, develop and move talent to critical areas of business. f or managers, \nWorkday provides a more streamlined way to manage their teams.\nThe table below reflects key data for the \npast three years about the company\u2019s work -\nforce training and development.\n*Attendee numbers are for fiscal year1  Every employee is encouraged annually to complete an online performance appraisal that becomes part of their permanent \nrecord and can serve as a basis for career development planning. While nearly all eligible employees receive performance \nratings from their manager, not all employees complete the appraisal. In addition, employees are encouraged annually to complete an Individual Development Plan that includes skills assessment and a development roadmap. In 2014, 76 percent of employees had a development plan in place.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2014.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
