Efforts \nare monitored through training, auditing \nand reporting.  \nThe company utilizes its Environmental \nManagement System (EMS) to deliver consistent environmental performance; \nour EMS is modeled after the international \nstandard IS o 14001. Third party certifica -\ntion of Applied\u2019s EMS began in 2004 and continues today with the addition of new manufacturing locations, as appropriate. \nThe company also uses software called the \nEnergy and Sustainability System (ESS) to \naccurately capture and track the company\u2019s \nenvironmental impact. The ESS allows the company to collect, analyze, interpret, act \non and report power and water consump -\ntion, waste generation, business travel \ndata and greenhouse gas (G hG) emissions \n(Scope 1 and 2 under the \u201cGreenhouse Gas Protocol\u201d*), with consistent units and  \ncorrelation to global reporting standards. \nThe data that are tracked and consolidated relies mostly on information provided on a \ncalendar year basis from utilities and other \nthird parties. \nEnERG y\nThe following Annual Worldwide Energy \nconsumption table shows direct and  \nindirect worldwide energy consumption at Applied\u2019s facilities for the last three years, including the amount of energy obtained \nfrom renewable sources.\n1  Excluding 650,000 square feet of leased office facilities for comparison to prior years, 2013 electricity \nconsumption was 289 GWh, representing a 2% decrease from 2012.\n2  Renewable energy consists of a combination of on-site generation and green power purchases.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAT_2014.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
