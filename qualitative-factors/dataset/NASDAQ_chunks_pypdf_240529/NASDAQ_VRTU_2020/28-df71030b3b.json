As the GHG Protocol does not provide a mechanism to \nreport on such emissions, we have not included it in our formal reporting but estimate \nemissions from remote work to be approximately 6,345.5 MTCO2. \n\u2022 We started calculating emissions from capital goods in FY20 and from transmission \nand distribution losses in FY21 so data is not available for prior years.
