There was also a policy, in certain businesses, of not replacing those employees leaving the company either to retire or to take up jobs elsewhere. \nAegon took measures again last year to limit compulsory redundancies and to help those losing their jobs find alternative employment. \nThese measures included: \n\u2022 Reassignment, where possible, within the company or switch to more flexible or part-time working \n\u2022 Assistance with job searches and re-training \n\u2022 Access to outside recruitment or outplacement services \n\u2022 Careers advice and ring-fencing of some positions for internal candidates \n\u2022 Dedicated internet and social media sites for employees to share information, leads and new job opportunities \n\u2022 Extensive internal communications to explain process to both managers and employees. \nDuring the year, there were also extensive consultations with employees, trade unions and other employee representative bodies \nconcerning reorganization and restructuring plans. Before making redundancies, Aegon explored other ways of reducing the company\u2019s operating expenses, including \u2013 in some businesses \u2013 salary and / or recruitment freezes. \nOf those employees made redundant in 2012, the majority accepted voluntary redundancy packages or early retirement. Overall, figures for 2012 showed a greater availability of labor in Aegon\u2019s markets, with the average number of applicants for each \nvacancy increasing by 10%. Skilled workers, however, remain in short supply, particularly in Asian emerging markets. Most recruits during the year were hired to replace staff leaving the company.
