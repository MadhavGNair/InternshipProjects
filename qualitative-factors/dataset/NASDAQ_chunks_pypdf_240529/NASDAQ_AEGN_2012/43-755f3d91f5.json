This training fulfills several functions: \n\u2022 To ensure there is scope for employees to improve performance and achieve personal goals \n\u2022 To develop existing talent within the organization \n\u2022 To raise awareness of risks such as fraud, money laundering and insider dealing \n\u2022 And, in certain cases, to ensure compliance with either internal or external regulatory requirements. \nAegon offers a variety of both online and class-based training programs. These include training on the company\u2019s Code of Conduct, \nwhich is mandatory for all employees and specific e-learning programs on tackling fraud, corruption and insider dealing. \nThere are also extensive programs at a local level, as well as more targeted conferences, webinars and online courses in specialist areas \nsuch as internal audit, sustainability, communications and risk management. These training programs may cover a number of different areas, such as customer service, product knowledge, business writing, corporate culture, compliance, diversity issues, negotiation skills and sales. Most Aegon units also grant employees time and occasionally financial support to pursue individual projects such as language training or higher education related to their work with the company. In the United States, Transamerica regularly organizes brief training sessions for managers, known as Take 15. In 2012, Take 15 courses addressed a number of topics, including labor standards, immigration and handling customer complaints. \nTraining programs are closely linked to employees\u2019 performance appraisals, which identify areas of weakness and possible \nimprovement. Aegon assesses performance according to a number of different criteria. These include the company\u2019s corporate values, critical work experience, technical skills and abilities, current potential and performance against financial, non-financial and personal targets. In some instances, Aegon also uses 180 or 360 degree appraisals. For senior management, the assessment is linked directly to career development and succession planning. In the United States, which accounts for almost half Aegon\u2019s total workforce, appraisals include a \u201csustainability\u201d component, which assesses employees\u2019 compliance with company values, rules and procedures, including the Aegon Code of Conduct. \nIn 2012, overall spending on training declined by 15%; this decrease was mainly due to a further reduction in Aegon\u2019s workforce during \nthe year.
