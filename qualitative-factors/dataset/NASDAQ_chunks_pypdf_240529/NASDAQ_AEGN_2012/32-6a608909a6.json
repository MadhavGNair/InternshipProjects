Interest rates are currently at the lowest level they\u2019ve been for many years. Aegon has reduced risk by lowering guarantees offered on some products, by re-pricing others and closely matching assets and long-term liabilities. \nCredit risk\t This is the risk that the sovereign and corporate bonds or other fixed income investments Aegon owns lose their value. Corporate bonds make up an important part of Aegon\u2019s investment portfolio. The company has taken several steps to reduce risk in this area: by reducing dependence on spread-based products such as fixed annuities in the United States, by switching investments to safer securities and by reducing the overall size of the company\u2019s balance sheet. Aegon has also reduced its exposure to troubled euro-zone economies like Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. At the end of 2012, investments in government securities in these five countries amounted to just 0.6% of the company\u2019s general account investments. \nFinancial risk is not the only risk Aegon faces. In many cases, as an insurance company, Aegon will look to take on more risk \u2013 in areas \nwhere there are attractive returns, and where the company believes the risks involved are manageable. Aegon\u2019s earnings depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which claims from customers correspond to the assumptions made when pricing and selling products. Changes in mortality rates, life expectancy, morbidity or policyholder behavior may all have a significant effect on the company\u2019s financial results. Aegon monitors these risks constantly, has complex models to predict trends and outcomes, and incorporates findings from these models into the pricing and structure of the company\u2019s products.
