Results are benchmarked against peers and high-performing companies from other sectors. \nFindings from the survey also play a key role in assessing the effectiveness of Aegon\u2019s products and services, and in identifying social, \nhealth & safety, sustainability or other operational risks. \nFollowing the previous survey, Aegon put in place a series of action plans, designed to address the main findings and improve \nspecific areas of weakness. These action plans were based on priorities set by the company\u2019s Management Board, which focused on strengthening internal communications and improving employees\u2019 understanding of Aegon\u2019s strategy and its products and services. Local action plans included additional product training for employees, as well as improvements to management communications and talent development. \nAegon held its latest survey in January 2013. Results from this survey will be used to assess progress with local action plans and to set \npriorities for 2013 / 2014. The survey showed an increase in both employee engagement and employee empowerment. The percentage of employees considering Aegon to be a \u201csocially responsible company\u201d also rose to 76%, up from 67%.
