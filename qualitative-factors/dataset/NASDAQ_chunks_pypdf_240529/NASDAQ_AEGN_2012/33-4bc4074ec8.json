{"page_content": " \n 33 Business overview Social, ethical, governance and environmental risks \nSocial, ethical, governance and environmental risks\n \nAegon knows that its business and operations may also be affected by social, ethical, governance and environmental factors. The \ncompany regularly assesses risk in these areas, and takes steps to manage that risk. Through its global employee survey, Aegon also assesses \u201crisk culture\u201d within the organization to ensure a proper level of vigilance toward operational and other business risks. \nOperational risks are assessed according to their likelihood and their possible impact on the company\u2019s performance and reputation. \nRisks are initially identified at a local level, assessed, incorporated into Aegon\u2019s broader approach to operational risk management, and reported at least once a quarter to the company\u2019s Management Board and Audit Committee. In many cases, specific thresholds are set \u2013 and remedial action taken if these thresholds are breached. \nConsideration of environmental, social and governance risks is also incorporated into Aegon\u2019s Responsible Investment Policy and its \napproach to supply chain management. \nAegon\u2019s operational risk management covers risks in areas such as sales practices, product pricing, fraud and money laundering, \nthreats to information security, physical risk, employee conduct and \u201cpeople risk\u201d, related to health & safety and possible incidents of discrimination in the workplace.
