{"page_content": " \n 16 Business overview Measuring customer loyalty \nMeasuring customer loyalty\n \nAegon regularly surveys its customers, and uses results from these surveys to make improvements to its products and services. The \ncompany also regularly surveys its brokers, agents and other intermediaries. The frequency of these surveys varies by market and business unit. Surveys, however, take place at least once a year. \nIn 2011, Aegon adopted the Net Promoter Score (NPS) as its preferred measure of customer loyalty, and is now rolling out NPS \nacross the company. Rather than gauging \u201csatisfaction\u201d, NPS is a measure of \u201ccustomer loyalty\u201d \u2013 identifying customers who would recommend Aegon products and services to family and friends. By the end of 2012, nearly three-quarters of Aegon businesses were using NPS. \nOver the past year, a number of changes have been as a direct result of Aegon\u2019s NPS programs, including the introduction of \nsimpler, more direct language in customer correspondence, better product documentation and a more efficient approach to product development. Aegon has dedicated Customer Relationship Management teams to coordinate improvements across different departments and disciplines. \nAegon collects data via a \u201ccustomer loyalty portal\u201d. This portal enables comparison of data, market research and benchmarking, which \ncan then be used to make further improvements in products and the level of customer service. The portal was launched in mid-2012, and is already used by Aegon business units in the Netherlands, Brazil and Hungary. \n2012 \n2011 Change 2010 \n% of businesses using Net Promoter Score 1) 74% 55% 34.5% 33% \n1 Average, weighted by IFRS capital.
