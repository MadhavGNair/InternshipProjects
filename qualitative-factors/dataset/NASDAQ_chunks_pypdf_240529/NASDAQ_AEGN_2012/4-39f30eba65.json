It also means becoming the \u201cmost respected and trusted\u201d provider of financial services in those markets. \nAegon\u2019s sustainability strategy supports this ambition in three main areas. \n\u2022 Ensuring that Aegon offers products and services customers can trust. \n\u2022 Ensuring a responsible approach to investments that takes into account social and environmental factors as well as financial ones. \n\u2022 Helping support and build better local communities in the areas where the company has operations. \nIn each of these three areas, Aegon has set itself a number of objectives which it expects to implement by the end of 2015. \n\u2022 Introduce new company-wide principles of market conduct, alongside existing local codes, to ensure \ncustomers are treated fairly; that products and services are clearly explained; and that customers are offered products that meet their specific requirements. \n\u2022\t Develop common benchmarks for product development and pricing to ensure products meet the same basic \ncriteria wherever they\u2019re sold around the world. \n\u2022\t Introduce the Net Promoter Score (NPS) as the company\u2019s preferred measure of customer loyalty, and use NPS \nto strengthen products and customer service. \n\u2022 Ensure environmental, social, and governance factors are taken into account when making investment decisions, as part of the company\u2019s broader policy on Responsible Investment. \n\u2022\t Explore the possibility of expanding Aegon\u2019s current impact investments in areas such as renewable energy and affordable housing. \n\u2022\t Expand the company\u2019s advocacy program, and focus research and public policy work on the key issues of global aging, retirement and financial literacy. \n\u2022\t Build a stronger corporate citizenship program to support communities around the world.
