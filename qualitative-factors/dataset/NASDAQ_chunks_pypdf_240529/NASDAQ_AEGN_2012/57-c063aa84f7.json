{"page_content": "57 About About this Supplement \nAbout this Supplement\n \nAegon takes an integrated approach to corporate reporting. This means the company reports financial performance alongside its \nenvironmental, social and governance performance, and explains, where possible, how non-financial factors such as customer service or employee engagement drive earnings and decision-making. \nAegon believes this approach gives stakeholders a more complete picture of the company \u2013 not only how it manages its business but \nalso its performance as an employer, investor and business partner. \nThis approach is embodied in Aegon\u2019s annual Review, which is the company\u2019s main integrated reporting document. Alongside the \nReview, Aegon also publishes an Annual Report, which meets the company\u2019s reporting obligations with regard to its financial regulators and provides more in-depth data and information on areas such as earnings, risk management and corporate governance. \nInformation for the Review and this online Sustainability Supplement is based on extensive reporting from Aegon\u2019s country and \nbusiness units around the world. All information is reviewed formally by the company\u2019s Disclosure and Disclosure Working Committees, and is subject to approval by members of the company\u2019s Management Board before publication. Contents of both the Review and Sustainability Supplement are also reviewed by Aegon\u2019s external auditors at Ernst & Young LLP and members of the company\u2019s Supervisory Board. \nFlow of information \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2012.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
