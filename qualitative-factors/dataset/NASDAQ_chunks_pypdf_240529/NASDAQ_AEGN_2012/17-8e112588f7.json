{"page_content": " 17 Business overview Customer feedback \nCustomer feedback\n \nAegon has various methods to collect customer feedback and uses this feedback to make improvements to its products and services. \nThese methods include call centers, dedicated customer telephone lines, email and letter. \nAegon business units operate call centers and have formal procedures in place for handling customer complaints. There are regular \nface-to-face meetings with some clients, and customers are also involved in advisory boards and other stakeholder panels. In the Netherlands and elsewhere, Aegon has worked directly with customers to design products, services and communications. In 2012, for example, Aegon launched Knab, a new online bank, co-created with customers. \nDuring the year, Aegon also launched a new \u201ccustomer license\u201d program. As part of this program, senior managers and other staff (who \ndon\u2019t have daily customer contact) are required to spend a minimum number of hours talking and working directly with customers. In 2012, customer complaints declined by almost 39% - a reflection primarily of improved market conditions and efforts to resolve problems with specific products in both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. \n2012 \n2011 Change 2010 \nCustomer complaints\t 50,415 82,314 1) (38.8%) 53,470 \n1 \tIn 2011, Aegon widened the definition it uses for \u201ccustomer complaints\u201d in the Netherlands.

The result, however, was a steep increase in complaints in 2011 compared with the previous year.
