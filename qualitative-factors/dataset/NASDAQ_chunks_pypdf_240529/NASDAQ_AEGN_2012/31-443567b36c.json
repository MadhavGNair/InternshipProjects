Consequently, the \ncompany is exposed to a variety of risks. The most important are movements in world financial markets. These movements can have a direct impact on the company\u2019s earnings, its performance and the value of its investments. In managing risk, Aegon\u2019s objective is to ensure that it continues to meet obligations to its customers and policyholders, even in extreme market conditions. \nOver the past few years, Aegon has taken steps to reduce its exposure to financial markets. This has been an important part of the \ncompany\u2019s overall strategy. By lowering risk in this area, Aegon effectively reduces the amount of capital it needs to set aside \u2013 capital which can then be reinvested in the business. \nIn recent years, Aegon has lowered its financial risk in three main ways: by reducing equity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. This has \nmade the company\u2019s earnings more stable and less sensitive to movements in financial markets. \nYou can find out more about our approach to risk management in Aegon\u2019s 2012 Annual Report.
