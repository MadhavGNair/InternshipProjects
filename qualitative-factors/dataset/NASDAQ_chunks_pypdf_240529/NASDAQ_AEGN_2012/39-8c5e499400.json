These include: \u2022 Regular health check-ups and assessments \n\u2022 Programs to reduce stress and promote healthy living (particularly cardiac health, diet, anti-smoking and disease prevention) \n\u2022 Counselling services (open, in some cases, both to employees and their families) \n\u2022 Free \u2018flu vaccinations in the winter \n\u2022 Workshops aimed at helping managers respond to employees who have suffered recent bereavement or other traumatic events \n\u2022 Access to company doctor and medical facilities \n\u2022 Guidelines for managers and employees on how to identify and manage stress in the workplace \n\u2022 Regular safety training, seminars and communications campaigns to raise awareness of health issues and potential risks \n\u2022 Online platforms to help employees with self-assessment and monitoring \n\u2022 Special safety and wellness committees to oversee the company\u2019s approach to health and safety issues. \nMost Aegon country units have written policies or statements in place in this area, and of course comply with local rules and \nregulations. In the United States, \u201chealth and fitness\u201d is included as a separate section in the company\u2019s Employee Handbook. Health and safety issues are assessed as part of the company\u2019s approach to operational risk management, and are often discussed in meetings between management and trade unions or other employee representative bodies. Aegon\u2019s annual employee survey also addresses questions linked to health and safety, and particularly to stress in the workplace (including respect and recognition and maintaining a reasonable work / life balance). This helps Aegon identify possible areas of weakness, which can be addressed through specific \u201coutcomes\u201d incorporated into managers\u2019 individual goals and targets. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, Aegon has an Employee Assistance Program, which provides confidential advice on issues such as bereavement and financial, medical or other personal and work-related problems. \nIn 2012, Aegon\u2019s overall absentee rate decreased to 2.3%, down from 2.6% the year. The decrease was due mainly to lower \nabsenteeism in the United States, the Netherlands and at Aegon\u2019s asset management operations. The number of work-related injuries and illnesses rose by almost 15%, but this was due to a change in reporting methodology in the Netherlands.
