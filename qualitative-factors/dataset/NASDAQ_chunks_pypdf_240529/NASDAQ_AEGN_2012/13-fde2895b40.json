{"page_content": " \n \n \n 13 Stakeholders Determining \"materiality\" \nDetermining \"materiality\"\n \nMateriality \u2013 determining which issues are most important both for Aegon and its stakeholders \u2013 is critical to sustainability reporting, \nand one of the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s ten main principles. \nEach year, Aegon puts together a \u201cmateriality matrix\u201d, which sets out the key issues for the company and its stakeholders. To compile \nthis matrix, Aegon uses findings from the company\u2019s annual stakeholder survey, as well as other information, including feedback from members of Aegon\u2019s Management Board and other senior managers. \nThe matrix helps determine the content of the company\u2019s annual Review \u2013 and shapes future sustainability projects and initiatives. \nAegon\u2019s external auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, also considers materiality each year as part of its review of the company\u2019s reporting. \nHow to interpret the matrix: This matrix is based on internal assessments and interviews conducted as part of Aegon\u2019s 2012 stakeholder survey. The importance of each issue is assessed using a scale of 1-4 (4 being the most important, 1 the least). Th e vertical \naxis shows the importance of each issue to Aegon, and the horizontal axis its importance to the company\u2019s stakeholders. \n\u2022 Quadrant A shows issues that are relatively more important to Aegon than its stakeholders. \n\u2022 Quadrant B shows issues of relatively minor importance to both Aegon and its stakeholders. \n\u2022 Quadrant C shows issues that are relatively more important to the company's stakeholders. \n\u2022 Quadrant D shows issues of importance to both Aegon and its stakeholders and may be considered the \"most material\".
