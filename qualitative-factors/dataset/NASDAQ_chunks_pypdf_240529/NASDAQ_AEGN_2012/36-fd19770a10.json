At the end of 2012, the United States alone accounted for 45% of all Aegon employees worldwide. \nAegon\u2019s total workforce decreased by 3.5% in 2012. This was the result primarily of the sale of some businesses and continued restructuring at operations in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada and Central & Eastern Europe. A\u00a0decrease in the workforce in these areas was partly offset by increases elsewhere, notably in Asia and at the company\u2019s asset management and central holding operations. Since the end of 2010, Aegon has reduced its total workforce by just over 11%, part\u00a0of\u00a0broader efforts to lower costs and re-focus the business on areas offering higher returns and stronger prospects for growth.
