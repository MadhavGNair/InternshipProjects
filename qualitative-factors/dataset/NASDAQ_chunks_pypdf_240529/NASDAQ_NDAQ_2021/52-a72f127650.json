We perform detailed evaluations \nfocused primarily on the types of risks that are likely to \nincrease direct costs or interrupt our primary business \nfunctions. While we have exposure to both physical and \ntransition drivers, transition drivers present both the \nmost significant risks and opportunities for Nasdaq\u2019s \nbusiness, strategy and financial planning across all time \nhorizons considered. Our low-carbon transition plan is a key strategy as part \nof our efforts to mitigate our business risks associated \nwith climate change. This plan is extensive and includes \ncalculating our greenhouse gas emissions since 2018, \nbenchmarking our global real estate portfolio to identify \nopportunities for energy efficiency, implementing \nidentified energy efficiency strategies, pursuing green \nbuilding certifications, minimizing emissions resulting \nfrom business travel, purchasing renewable electricity, \nand committing to setting Science-Based Targets. We \nare also in the process of launching a robust supplier \nengagement strategy to address climate risk, seeking to \nbuild resilience and hedge against future price or market \ninstability.
