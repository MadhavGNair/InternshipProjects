This is because emissions \nare created at every stage of our \nproduct lifecycle, extending to our \ncustomers\u2019 use and disposal of \nour products. Since FY15, we have \nrequired our key manufacturing \nsuppliers to report their energy \nusage, GHG emissions data, and \ntheir reduction goals and objectives. \nIn FY18, we added a requirement \nthat these suppliers have their GHG \nemissions verified by a third party. \nWe have used this supplier data to \nhelp us better understand the GHG \nemissions footprint of our product \nmanufacturing and to calculate the \nallocation of carbon emissions from \ntier 1 suppliers that are attributable \nto our customers.Reporting and \nExternal Assurance \nEach year, we participate in the \nCDP climate change and water \nsurveys. Participants are scored \nbased on their understanding and \nmanagement of their business \nrisks, opportunities, and impacts \nrelated to climate change and water \nresources. Between FY10 and FY16, \nwe improved our climate change \ndisclosure score from 34 to 98 (out \nof a possible 100 points). In FY18, we \nscored a B in the CDP\u2019s new scoring \nparadigm for climate change, and in \nFY19, we scored an A-.
