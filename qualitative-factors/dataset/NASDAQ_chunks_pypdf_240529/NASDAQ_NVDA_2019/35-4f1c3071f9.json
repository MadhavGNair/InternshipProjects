{"page_content": "36NVIDIA 2019 CSR REPORT  SOCIAL\nBuilding the Future \nSTEM Pipeline\nImproving the representation of \nwomen and minorities in tech \nrequires a long-term perspective, \nso we implemented a number \nof programs to engage in STEM \nactivities with girls and other \nunrepresented groups. We reach \nyouth through technology donations, \nsponsorships, campus visits, guest \nspeakers, and career roundtables.\nFrom FY18-FY19, we engaged \nseveral hundred girls and \nunderrepresented youth through \norganizations such as: Girls \nEngaged in Math and Science \n(GEMS), Santa Clara University\u2019s \nSummer Engineering Seminar \nProgram, Iridescent\u2019s Technovation \nProgram, 49er STEM Leadership \nInstitute, Third Street Community \nCenter\u2019s Young Engineers Program, \nand Girls Who Code. We also \nengaged several hundred students \nfrom the Santa Clara Unified School \nDistrict through our Techsplorer \nprogram. In FY17\u2013FY19, through \nthe India Companies Act, we funded \norganizations in India that helped \nmore than 3,000 young women from \nimpoverished communities in India gain greater access to computer \ntraining and develop skills to \nimprove their career opportunities.\nDeveloper Inclusivity \nand Diversity \nEach year, we hold our developers \nforum, the GPU Technology \nConference , in San Jose, California. \nGTC is an opportunity to extend our \ninclusion efforts to our ecosystem.\nAt our 2019 conference, we \nincreased female attendance by \nmore than 50 percent and almost \ndoubled the number of talks that \nincluded a woman speaker. And for \nthe sixth year in a row, GTC included \nevents  specifically for women. We \nhosted a Women in Deep Learning \n& AI breakfast and panel focused on \nthe AI healthcare ecosystem, as well \nas a session on how organizations \nare lowering the barriers to entry \ninto AI engineering.\nNew this year, we hosted a Women\u2019s \nEarly Career Accelerator  to give \n50 women starting out in AI access \nto our deep learning courses that \nprovide hands-on training and \nopportunities to network. In 2019, Forbes  called out GTC as a top \nconference for women wanting to \nlearn more about AI.\nOther activities to increase the \nnumber of women and minority \ntechnologists attending GTC \nincluded: \n >Scholarships for members of \nBlack in AI and Latinx in AI\n >Free conference passes to local \nuniversities and women-in-\ntechnology organizations\n >Reaching out to women in our \nuniversity and developer network \nto encourage them to speak, \nwhich helped to increase female \nspeakers in 2019 by 40 percent \n >Highlighting women speakers \non the main GTC website and \nprominently featuring them in \npromotional materials\nBeyond this, we\u2019ve also recruited \nat the Grace Hopper Conference, \nsponsored Black in AI  events \nat NeurIPS and hosted a mixer \nwith Latinx in AI  and Black in AI  \nmembers at GTC.\nMAKING OUR MARK  In 2018, 40 NVIDIANs joined the Grace Hopper  Celebration of Women in \nComputing conference \u2014 the world\u2019s largest gathering of women technologists.
