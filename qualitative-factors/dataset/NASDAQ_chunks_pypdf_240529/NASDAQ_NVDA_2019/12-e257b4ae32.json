Our corporate \ngovernance structure ensures \nrobust Board and management \naccountability and transparency to \nour shareholders, and promotes \ngood decision-making now and for \nthe future. To ensure that long-\nterm interests are being served, \nour Board oversees management \nperformance. Our overarching code \nof conduct, financial team code of \nconduct, corporate governance \npolicies, Board committee charters, \ncertificate of incorporation,and bylaws form the framework for \ngovernance at NVIDIA.\nWe have 12 directors on our \nBoard, and as of April 2019, 11 of \nour 12 directors (91 percent) are \nindependent. The sole exception is \nJensen Huang, who is our founder, \npresident, and chief executive \nofficer. Our bylaws and corporate \ngovernance policies permit the \nroles of chairperson of the Board \nand CEO to be filled by the same or \ndifferent individuals, which gives \nthe Board flexibility in determining \nwhat is best for the company. \nAt this time, NVIDIA has a lead \ndirector, Mark Perry, rather than a \nchairperson of the Board. In FY19, \nall directors attended at least 75 \npercent of meetings of the Board \nand committee on which  \nthey served.\nDirector compensation is reviewed \nby the Board\u2019s Compensation \nCommittee, in consultation with \na third-party firm and evaluation \nof compensation from peer \ngroups, and ultimately approved \nby our Board.
