Amazon has launched \ninitiatives with Feeding America and Good360 to donate these goods and \nensure these products get directed to communities in need.\nIn 2018, Amazon and Whole Foods Market donated 23 million meals to \nFeeding America through its donation program in addition to useful apparel \nand supplies to Good360 and other nonprofits. Amazon is dedicated to \nengaging with its local community and donations is one of the ways we \nachieve this.\nThroughout countries in Europe, we collaborate with local food banks to \ndonate products to communities in need. Amazon partners with the German \nnonprofit Innatura, which brokers product donations in kind to charitable \norganizations and which we have supported as a founding partner since \n2013. In this way, more than 1,000 charities have received Amazon donations \nand around 450,000 needy people have benefited from them. Donations \ninclude toys, shoes, clothing, or drugstore items among others. We also work \nwith In Kind Direct, a United Kingdom national charity that manages the \ndonation of surplus products to charities across the country. Through our \nwork with In Kind Direct, we have \ndonated over 170,000 products \nworth over \u00a34.5 million ($5.5 \nmillion), and in 2017 alone we \ndonated 47,000 products worth \n\u00a31.5 million ($1.8 million) to over \n1,800 charities and voluntary \norganizations across the United Kingdom.
