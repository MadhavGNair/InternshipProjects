{"page_content": "Cloud Efficiency\n\u201cOur results show \nthat AWS\u2019s infrastructure \nis 3.6 times more energy \nefficient than the median of \nthe surveyed U.S. enterprise data centers. \nMore than two-thirds of this advantage \nis attributable to the combination of a \nmore energy efficient server population \nand much higher server utilization. AWS \ndata centers are also more energy efficient \nthan enterprise sites due to comprehensive \nefficiency programs that touch every facet \nof the facility.\nWhen we factor in the carbon intensity of \nconsumed electricity and renewable energy \npurchases, which reduce associated carbon \nemissions, AWS performs the same task with \nan 88% lower carbon footprint.\u201d\nSource: 451 Research, 2019, All Rights Reserved.\n59", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2019.pdf", "page": 58, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
