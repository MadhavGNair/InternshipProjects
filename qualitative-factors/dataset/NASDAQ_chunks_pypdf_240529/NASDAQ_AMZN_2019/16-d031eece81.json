At the heart of the Seattle campus is The \nSpheres, an indoor plant conservatory housing 40,000 plants from the cloud \nforest regions of more than 30 countries, that provides a natural source of \ninsulation and cooling.\nThe U.S. Green Building Council has awarded 26 of our Seattle buildings with \nLEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification as of June \n2019, including 18 that are LEED Gold and four that have achieved \nLEED Platinum, the two highest tiers of certification for \nsustainable design and construction methods. \nSome of our buildings in the Denny Triangle area of \nSeattle are heated through a district energy system that \nrecycles heat generated at a neighboring data \ncenter. Green roofs on our Doppler building \nand adjacent Meeting Center reduce \nbuilding heating and cooling loads, \nclean and reduce storm water runoff \nby at least 70%, moderate the \nurban heat island effect, and \nimprove local air quality. \nAmazon also encourages \nsustainable transport for employee \ncommutes. In Seattle, more \nthan half of employees walk, \nbike, or take public transport to \nwork. In 2017 alone, we provided \n$63 million toward employees\u2019 public \ntransit fares. In many Amazon buildings across \nSeattle, we offer plug-in electric vehicle charging stations to our employees, \nwith additional charging infrastructure offered to our employees in multiple \nother locations as well.\nHQ2 and Offices Worldwide\nOur new offices and fulfillment centers are equipped with energy-efficient \ntechnologies such as LED lighting, advanced building management systems, \nmotor variable frequency drives, high-efficiency heating and cooling systems, \nand remote energy and power monitoring.\n17", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2019.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
