{"page_content": "\u2022 Waste, recycling, and the circular economy\n\u2022 Sustainable products\nAmazon uses a variety of mechanisms to ensure that sustainability is \nembedded in our business operations. We integrate sustainability practices \ninto our everyday operations through goal-setting, metrics, and quarterly \nbusiness reviews. \nIn the area of climate change in particular, we are developing the data and \ntools to address climate risks for both our business and our customers. The \nfoundation of this work is the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), \na global and authoritative source for open-sourced weather, climate, and \nsustainability data. This data, together with AWS analytical tools, is enabling \ncutting-edge scientific work and helping us raise the bar for customers. \nFor example, by using the NOAA weather data available in ASDI, Amazon \ntransportation teams have been able to better predict how weather-related \nevents (snowstorms, floods, heatwaves, etc.) impact customer package \ndeliveries, and we have provided customers with more accurate delivery \nestimates as a result. The AWS Infrastructure team also leverages weather \ndata from ASDI to better assess the impact of weather on AWS data centers. \nWe are developing a robust tool for assessing and managing weather and \nclimate-related risks for our assets, people, and operations. Our ultimate goal \nis to enable customers and suppliers to use the tools we are developing in-\nhouse to improve climate resilience. \n69", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMZN_2019.pdf", "page": 68, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
