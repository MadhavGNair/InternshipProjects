{"page_content": "5Materiality assessment\nLast year, working with consulting firm BSR, we engaged \nAutodesk executives and content experts from across the company\u2019s business groups, functions, and regions to \nevaluate the environmental and social issues that have \nthe largest impact on Autodesk\u2019s success as a company and the most relevance to global sustainable development. We also assessed the level of influence \nthat Autodesk has in each area and how each of these \nfactors might evolve between now and 2050. Through this process, we looked for gaps or blind spots in our strategy and worked to identify emerging issues.\nThe assessment confirmed the areas where we have \nhistorically focused our sustainability efforts. It also complemented other analyses we conduct, such as \nthose related to Autodesk\u2019s product strategies and \nmarket sizing.\nThe following issues rated highest in importance to \nAutodesk\u2019s business success as well as importance to \nsustainable development:\n\u2022 Enable energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions \nreductions for Autodesk customers \u2022 Support best practices, and spur new practices, across the design industry with our technology and public policy efforts\n\u2022 Advance sustainable design education \n\u2022 Ensure the privacy and security of the data Autodesk collects\n\u2022 Ensure diversity and equal opportunity within the \nAutodesk workforce\n\u2022 Mitigate the impact of piracy and theft of Autodesk intellectual property\n\u2022 Invest in Autodesk employee training and development\n\u2022 Enable energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions \nreductions in our own business operations\nThese findings inform our strategy and provide a platform for further engagement with external stakeholders as well as executives and employees companywide. \nSee pages 8\u201310 of our FY2013 Sustainability Progress \nReport for additional details, as well as key themes from the analysis and expected trends for some of these issues \nin the coming decades.\n\u00a9 Jeff Goldberg / Esto", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2014.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
