In 2022, FOCOS launched the \ufb01  rst part of the Formative Solution for Inclusive Educa-\ntion. We started with training pills and e-books on integration, inclusion, pedagogical adjustments, \nlegislation and the manager\u2019s role in working with Inclusive Education.Another example is the Positi-\nvo Learning System, that aligned to its commitment for an inclusive education, adapts its material to \nserve students with visual needs by printing its materials in Braille, enlarging the books on A3 sheet, \nand printing on colored paper.\nFOCOS\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2025P*04.000.000\n3.000.000\n2.000.000\n1.000.000\n500.0003.500.000\n2.500.000\n1.500.000\n405.814405.814498.553498.5531.362.1411.362.1411.785.5761.785.576\n4.000.0004.000.0004.000.000\n4.000.000\n2.279.025\n20232.619.890\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARCE_2022.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
