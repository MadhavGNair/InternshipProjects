We conduct training for our teams and our partner \nschools on the importance of the General Data Protection \nLaw and the identi\ufb01  cation of potential risks in the pro-\ncessing of personal data, in addition to establishing the \nappropriate \ufb02  ows for sharing such data with our schools \nand commercial partners.CYBERSECURITY\nOur data security team works on the maintenance of the \nArco Data Security Program, which aims to increase the \nprotection of our environments and mitigate the risks of \npossible attacks, in addition to monitoring and operating \nthe routine of our Data Security tools and services. \nIn pursuit of the best Data Security practices, we use the \nNIST security framework and ISO/IEC 270001 in all our \nbusiness units - which directs practices, controls and te-\nchnologies to recover, identify, protect, detect and res-\npond to cyber risks.\n300WE REACHED OUR VRI (VULNERABILITY \nRISK INDEX) GOAL, SCORING BELOW3IN 2022, WE ACHIEVED OUR GOAL \nWITH A NIST SECURITY LEVEL\nA REFERENCE LEVEL \nIN THE EDUCA TION MARKET\n(LOW RISK) \nIN 2022. \nWe know that to build an ethical company that protects \nits stakeholders and positively impacts its customers, we \nneed to maintain a solid governance structure.
