During 2021, we increased our overall usage \nof renewable energy by 15%. We do this through a variety of methods, including \nhydroelectric power, purchasing units of energy generated through wind and solar \nfrom local utility providers, and new for 2022, the installation of solar panels on \nselected Merit properties. Part of our continuous improvement goals is creating \nlong-term site plans for each of our locations that include an assessment on \nincreasing green energy usage year over year.\n2030 ENERGY GOAL\nBy 2030, 50% of Merit\u2019s \nenergy usage will come from \nrenewable sources, and our \nenergy intensity will decrease \nby 10%, indexed to revenue.\n41,454,760 \n10,060,006 162,948,761 \n191,452,533 \n - 50,000,000 100,000,000 150,000,000 200,000,000 250,000,000\n2021 2020\nRenewable Non-renewableRENEWABLE ENERGY (MJ)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MMSI_2021.pdf", "page": 32, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
