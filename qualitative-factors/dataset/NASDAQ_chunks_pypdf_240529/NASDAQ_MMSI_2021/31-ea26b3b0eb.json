Sites are also reducing indirect emissions by procuring renewable energy \nsources for electricity needs.\nGRI 305-1 //  GRI 305-2 | In comparison to our 2020 baseline year, we have seen \na reduction in energy intensity and GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2). Our energy \nintensity decreased by 9%. While total energy usage consumption rose by 2,891 \nMJ across the organization, our utilization of that energy to produce revenue \nhas resulted in the decrease in our overall energy intensity. Our GHG emissions \nintensity decreased by 24%. This is a result of moving to more green energy, \nthe rise in our overall revenues, and the incremental improvement in location-\nbased emissions factors for 2021. Our total GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2) for \n2021 were 18,200 MT of CO2e, a decrease of 3,202 MT of CO2e from our 2020 \nbaseline of 21,402 MT of CO2e. Total scope 1 emissions for 2021 were 3,415 MT \nof CO2e from stationery and vehicle combustion, and scope 2 emissions for 2021 \nwere 14,785 MT of CO2e.\nDuring 2021, our total global energy usage was approximately 204,404, MJ,  \nan increase of 2,891 MJ over the 2020 baseline energy consumption of 201,513 \nMJ. This includes purchased electricity and fuels used by Merit-managed and \nMerit-operated facilities. \n3,415 2,995 14,785 18,405 \n - 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000\n2021 2020\nScope 1 emissions Scope 2 emissionsSCOPE 1 AND SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS (MT)\n0.0222\n0.0169\n0.00000.00500.01000.01500.02000.0250\n2020 2021GHG EMISSIONS INTENSITY SCOPE 1 AND SCOPE 2 (MT/$KRev)ENERGY INTENSITY (MT/$KRev)\n00.050.10.150.20.25\n2020 B aseline 20210.209065491\n0.190187309", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MMSI_2021.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
