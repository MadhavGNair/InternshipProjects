Our \ndedication to reducing GHG emissions and \naddressing climate change that threatens \nhuman health supports and furthers our \nmission at Merit Medical to be the most \ncustomer-focused company in healthcare.\nWe acknowledge the scientific evidence \npresented by the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) \nconcerning the need to limit global \naverage temperature increase to avoid \ncatastrophic effects of climate change. \nWe also understand the risks and \nopportunities that climate change brings \nto Merit\u2019s global organization and assess \nthese risks and opportunities within our \nEnterprise Opportunity Management \n(EOM) program. We recognize that using \nenergy effectively and efficiently as well \nas investing in renewable energy can \nconserve natural resources and reduce \nfossil fuel combustion that contribute to \nGHG emissions and global warming.\nWe are committed to reducing \nthe environmental footprint of our organization through increased  \nefficiency, resource conservation, \nresponsible procurement and logistics, \nand product innovation. As such, we have \ndesignated 2020 as a baseline year and \nhave made the following commitments  \nby the end of year 2030:\n\u2022 50% of our total energy usage will \ncome from renewable sources.\n\u2022 Our energy intensity (kWh/$ revenue) \nwill decrease by 10% or more.\n\u2022 Our GHG emissions will decrease by \n15% or more, indexed to revenue.\nIn addition, we have set goals to  \ndecrease our water intensity by 10%, \nindexed to revenue. Through these \nactions we believe we will reduce GHGs \nfrom our operations, contribute to \nreducing our overall usage of natural \nresources, and mitigate environmental \nimpacts in our business.\nTo learn more about our efforts to reduce \nGHG emissions, energy consumption, \nand natural resource usage, visit our \nCorporate Sustainability Report at \nwww.merit.com/about/corporate-\nsustainability/ .One of our key environmental risks stems from \nthe type of products we produce. Single-use \nmedical devices play a significant role in patient \nsafety and outcomes. However, at the end \nof their use, even when disposed of properly, \nthey have an impact on the environment. We \ntherefore strive to continuously improve how we \nmanufacture and distribute our products, aiming \nto make significant contributions in the material \nareas where we can have the greatest impact. \nADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe Merit Medical Systems, Inc.
