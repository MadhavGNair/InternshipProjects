We believe that Zealand has an obligation to be socially \nresponsible in order to benefit not only our main stakeholders, mainly shareholders, patients and \nemployees, but also society. A key focus for us across our business is to have open, engaging and \nrespectful communication with all our stakeholders.  \n   \nOur CSR efforts are based on the most common  elements of some of the most widely implemented CSR \ninitiatives in the world, notably the Global Re porting Initiative (GRI) and the United Nations Global \nCompact. Within these two systems, Zealand has found complementary frameworks for both guiding and \nreporting its CSR activities , along with several principles in the areas of labor, e environment, human \nrights and anticorruption. In addition to these, we have added  a provisional category for animal rights , \ngiven  the unique requirements  of our industry.  \n \nZealand is a Danish biotech company  discovering an d developing novel peptide -based  medicines.  \nWe are passionate about improving patients\u2019  lives and co mmitted to delivering value for  all our \nstakeholders.

We will  continue to grow our pipelin e through internal research as well as  \nin licensing  and acquisitions.   \n \nWe intend to realiz e the value of our drug product  candidates ourselves and have significantly \nstrengthened our  competencies to ensure that we can successfully advance  products along the clinical \ndevelopment and registration path.  We have built a strong in ternal setup and secured solid  partnership \nagreemen ts for clinical trial execution and  manufacturing in order  to advance our Phase 2 product  \ncandidates : the GLP -2 analogu e glepaglutide, targeting short  bowel syndrome, and the  two glucagon \nanalogue programs  with dasiglucagon.
