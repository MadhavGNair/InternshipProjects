{"page_content": "GRI G4 content index\nThe content of this report is prepared in accordance with the core option of the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s \n(GRI) G4 guidelines. \nWe have also referred to the GRI Media Sector Supplement and include disclosures for the indicators relevant  \nto our business. These are marked (M). However, the Media Sector Supplement has been developed primarily  \nfor content-generating organisations such as broadcasters and newspapers, and issues such as editorial \nindependence and freedom of expression are not material for our business. This means the majority of the \nindicators in the Media Sector Supplement are not relevant to our reporting and are not included in this Index.\nGeneral Standard Disclosures Comment Location in document\nGENERAL STANDARD DISCLOSURES\nSTRATEGY AND ANALYSIS\nG4-1 Statement from most senior decision maker.
