{"page_content": "Conclusion\nBased on the verification conducted by Bureau Veritas, there is no evidence to suggest that the GHG emissions \nassertions shown below, and the age, gender, ethnicity, health and safety and waste KPIs as stated by WPP in its \n2016/2017 Sustainability Report:\n \u2022are not prepared in accordance with WPP\u2019s relevant internal methodologies; and\n \u2022are not materially correct and a fair representation of the GHG emissions, waste and employment data for WPP.\nReported GHG emissions \nScope 1: 7,851  tonnes of CO2e\nScope 2:  116,905 tonnes of CO2e (net, including the carbon reduction of green-tariff electricity & Renewable Energy Certificates)  \n146,846  tonnes of CO2e (gross, excluding the carbon reduction of green-tariff electricity & Renewable Energy Certificates)\nScope 3: 92,445 tonnes CO2e (air travel)\nSuch opinion is based on work undertaken and the limitations and exclusions defined in this statement.\nLimitations and exclusions\nExcluded from the scope of our work is any verification of information relating to:\n \u2022activities outside the defined reporting period;\n \u2022WPP estimates its other scope 3 emissions, including from leased cars, taxis and couriers, as an additional \n15% of its total GHG emissions figure, added to the carbon footprint and reported as \u2018other estimated scope \n3 emissions\u2019. These scope 3 GHG emissions were not subject to verification; and\n \u2022one of the 10 of WPP\u2019s locations selected for remote data verification could not provide the relevant back-ups \nfor waste and sickness days in due time and hence was not subject to verification. \nObservations and recommendations\n \u2022WPP has demonstrated a consistent and structured approach towards sustainability data reporting across \noperations and parameters.\n \u2022Several sites are not currently reporting all of the waste that they generate, due to a lack of available source \ninformation. In these instances, applying a consistent estimation would help to avoid gaps in the waste data.\nStatement of independence, integrity and competence\nBureau Veritas is an independent professional services company that specialises in quality, environmental, health, \nsafety and social accountability with over 185 years\u2019 history.
