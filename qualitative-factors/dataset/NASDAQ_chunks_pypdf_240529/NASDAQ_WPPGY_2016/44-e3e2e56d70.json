Around  \n21% of our people have flexible working arrangements, 65% of flexible working requests are approved by our \ncompanies and 46% of our companies offer career breaks and sabbaticals. \nWe launched our Family Friendly Guidelines and Parent Portal for UK operating companies during 2016, \nfollowing an extensive benchmarking exercise.
