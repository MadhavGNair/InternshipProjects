This review and verification \nfocuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by A pple Inc. (as defined by \nWRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol \u2013 Scope 3 Account ing and Reporting Standard). It is \nnoted that emissions relating to the facilities tha t are owned or leased by Apple (scope 1 \nand 2 emissions) as well as business travel and emp loyee commute were subject to a \nseparate third party verification and are therefore  excluded from the scope of this \nstatement. Confidential data relating to product sa les and shipments were also excluded \nfrom the scope of this verification.  \nThis review and verification covers Apple\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not \nreplace reviews conducted for individual product LC As for greenhouse gas emissions \n(GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by A pple for individual products has been \ncalculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/ 14044: Environmental management \u2013 \nLife cycle assessment \u2013 Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This \nreview and verification furthermore complies with I SO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases -- Part \n3: Specification with guidance for the validation a nd verification of greenhouse gas \nassertions.  \nThe review of the annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria: \n\uf0a7The system, boundaries and functional unit are clea rly defined \n\uf0a7Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate \n\uf0a7Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used \nare adequately disclosed \n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   72 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 71, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
