Renewable \nenergy generates minimal Scope 2 \nemissions, whereas burning coal, oil, or \nnatural gas to produce electricity releases \ncarbon dioxide and other greenhouse \ngases into the atmosphere. We\u2019ve significantly reduced our emissions.\nOur transition to renewable energy has reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 64 percent \nsince 2011, preventing over 2.8 million metric tons of CO\u2082e from entering the atmosphere. \nThat\u2019s equivalent to taking more than 590,000 cars off the road for one year.14\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   14 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
