Our suppliers are taking \nsignificant actions to join us in this work, and we look \nforward to seeing more bold pledges as we continue to \naddress our environmental impact.\u201d \n \n Jeff Williams  \nApple\u2019s Chief Operating OfficerEducating partners.\nWe share our learnings with our supplier partners and help them plot their transition to \nrenewable energy. In 2017 , Apple developed the Clean Energy Portal, an online platform to \nhelp suppliers identify commercially viable renewable energy solutions in regions around the \nworld. We continue to add new content, including policy guidance and financial analysis tools, \nintended to make adoption of clean energy in key markets even easier. Over 100 suppliers have \nregistered for the site. \nAdvocating for strong policy.\nClean energy technology offers tremendous benefits to our suppliers, to electricity grids, \nand to countries. So we actively support policies that create cost-effective renewable \nenergy markets, and we work closely with suppliers to engage local, regional, and national \ngovernments. This encourages the development of policies that support scalable renewable \nenergy solutions. \nSupplier progress.\nPartners across our supply chain are installing or investing in sizable solar projects and \npurchasing clean energy directly from renewable projects or from their utility. As of April 2019, \n44 manufacturing partners in 16 countries have committed to 100 percent renewable energy \nfor Apple production:\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   16 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
