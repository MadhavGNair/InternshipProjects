{"page_content": "A more energy efficient supply chain.\nIn 2015, we started engaging directly with suppliers to help them reduce their energy use.  \nWe aim to educate them about energy efficiency, identify energy efficiency project \nopportunities, and manage those projects to completion. We prioritize facilities with the highest \nenergy use and potential for improvement. Then we conduct energy audits and train suppliers \nto uncover opportunities for energy efficiency\u2014like replacing outdated or inefficient heating, \ncooling, and lighting systems; repairing compressed air leaks; and recovering waste heat.  \nThe assessments provide suppliers with a cost-benefit analysis for implementing energy \nefficiency improvements.\nSince the inception of this program in 2015, we have engaged 59 suppliers at 85 facilities. In \n2018, our program implemented energy efficiency measures that prevented 466,000 metric \ntons of CO\u2082e from entering the atmosphere.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   21 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
