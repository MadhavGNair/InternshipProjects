We make the most of materials by \nreducing waste and creating long-lasting products. And when our customers return products \nthrough Apple Trade In, we make sure the materials in those devices are used again and again.\nOur strategy is to create circular supply chains and reduce our impact on the planet\u2019s \nresources by: \n\u2022  Designing and building products and packaging with recycled and renewable materials, \nand using materials more efficiently. \n\u2022  Making long-lasting products by designing highly durable hardware, creating a broad \nnetwork of repair providers, and ensuring software compatibility with older models. \n\u2022  Collecting products through Apple Trade In to extend their life or recover their materials.\nHow we define a circular supply chain\nRenewable materials market\nSource Contribute\nRecycled materials market \nCreate and\nprotectCollect Make Use Recover\nCreating a circular supply chain\nReaching our goal means focusing on three key aspects of our supply chain: \n1) Source strategically and make efficiently: Use recycled and renewable materials while manufacturing \nproducts efficiently to minimize use of materials. \n2) Use for a long time: Design products to be durable, so they can have long lives.\n3) Contribute: Ensure materials go back into the market for Apple or others to use.We\u2019re focusing our initial efforts  \non the following materials: \n\u2022 Aluminum\n\u2022 Cobalt \n\u2022 Copper\n\u2022 Glass\n\u2022 Gold\n\u2022 Lithium\n\u2022 Paper\n\u2022 Plastics\u2022  Rare earth   \n elements\n\u2022 Steel\n\u2022 Tantalum \n\u2022 Tin\n\u2022 Tungsten\n\u2022 Zinc\nFor more information on how we  \nprioritized these\u00a0materials, read our  \npaper on  Material Impact Profiles (PDF)\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   25 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
