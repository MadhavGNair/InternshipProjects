Our approach begins with \ncollecting comprehensive chemical composition information for the substances used to \nmake our products as well as the process chemicals, like cleaners and degreasers, suppliers \napply when making our products. We use this information to evaluate supplier compliance \nwith the Apple Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) \u2014our own set of global chemicals \nrestrictions that goes beyond regulatory requirements and is based on best industry practices \nor toxicology properties.
