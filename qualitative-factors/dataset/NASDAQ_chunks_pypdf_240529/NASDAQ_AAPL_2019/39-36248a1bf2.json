{"page_content": "Discharging water responsibly. \nManaging wastewater discharge is also an important way to conserve water resources in  \na watershed. \nAt our Santa Clara Valley campus, we\u2019re implementing an onsite wastewater treatment system \nthat will treat approximately 550,000 gallons per year of water onsite and return it to the \nmunicipal wastewater system. And at our data centers in Prineville, Oregon, and Reno, Nevada, \nour teams have been deploying a mineral filter media that allows us to recapture more of the \nwater we use in cooling, reducing water discharge by up to 30 percent. \nOur Supplier Code of Conduct includes standards for wastewater discharge quality, and we \nregularly audit for compliance with these high standards. Our Clean Water Program engagement \ngoes beyond compliance to help our suppliers build world-class water management  \nsystems. We target supplier sites based on water discharge risk and launch intensive,  \nmulti-year engagements. We begin with a comprehensive assessment that leads to targeted \nimprovements, including installation of improved infrastructure, use of cutting-edge wastewater \ntreatment technologies, and the creation of systems for validating discharge. Throughout the \nprogram, we engage deeply to create cultural change and promote greater water literacy.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   40 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\nWater Treatment Manager at a \nClean Water Program facility for \npackaging manufacturing, China.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
