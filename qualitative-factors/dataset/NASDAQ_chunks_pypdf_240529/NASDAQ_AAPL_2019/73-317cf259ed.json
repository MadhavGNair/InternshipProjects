The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions: \n\uf0a7Are product LCAs referenced correctly? \n\uf0a7Are results for products, for which no full LCA rev iew was undertaken, plausible? \n\uf0a7Are carbon emission data for individual products pl ausible in the light of \nmethodological changes as indicated by Apple?  \nThis review was done remotely. \n3 Findings \nIn FY2018 and beginning of FY2019 10 recent product  LCA studies have been reviewed \nsuccessfully against ISO 14040/44. These LCAs cover product segments MacBook Pro, \niMac, Apple Watch, Homepod and iPhone. These recent ly reviewed LCA studies cover \nproducts which represent in total 44,9% of the tota l scope 3 carbon footprint. \nRepresentatives of other product segments (iPod, iP ad, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, Airport Express \n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   74 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 73, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
