And after our devices have \nenjoyed long lives, we look to them as a resource for the future.\u00a0\nDaisy expansion\nWe updated Daisy to disassemble  \nsix more models of iPhone for  \na total of 15.Plastic reduction\nWe reduced plastic use in our \npackaging by 48% in three years. \nMaterial recovery lab\nWe\u2019re partnering with industry  \nexperts and academia to further \nexpand innovation around recycling \nand disassembly.\nRecycled cobalt\nWe\u2019re starting to use recycled \ncobalt\u2014sourced from iPhone batteries \nrecovered from Daisy and scrap  \nfrom select supplier sites\u2014in the \nbatteries of new products. \nRecycled plastic\nWe introduced 82 components with an \naverage of 38% recycled plastic across \nproducts released just this year.Recycled tin\nWe expanded, to 11 products, our use \nof 100% recycled tin in the solder on \nmain logic boards.\nRecycled aluminum\nWe launched our 2018 MacBook Air \nand Mac mini with 100% recycled \naluminum enclosures, cutting the \ncarbon footprint of each product nearly \nin half.\nProduct take-back\nWe refurbished more than 7.8 million \ndevices and recycled more than \n48,000 metric tons of e-waste  \nthis year.Highlights\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   23 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
