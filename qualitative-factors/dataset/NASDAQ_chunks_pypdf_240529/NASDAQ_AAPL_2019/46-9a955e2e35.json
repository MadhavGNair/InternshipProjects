This includes GreenScreen\u00ae, which considers 18 criteria to help us \nunderstand the materials\u2019 effects on people\u2019s health and the environment. We also have in-\nhouse, board-certified toxicologists who use lab testing and computer modeling to create \ntoxicological profiles that previously didn\u2019t exist\u2014addressing a major challenge in this field. \nOnly materials that pass our rigorous review process are accepted for our products.\nWe\u2019re just as committed to the safety of the people who make our products. We require \nour suppliers to follow the standards set in our RSS. In 2014, we launched our Chemical \nManagement Program to help suppliers develop a comprehensive approach to managing \nchemicals safely. The program, which has grown to 113 participating supplier facilities, \nenables our partners to shift to safer chemicals and improve general safety, awareness, \nand training. And to help drive toward safer chemicals, we map chemicals use and screen \nthem using GreenScreen\u00ae to assess the safety of cleaners and degreasers used at \nsupplier final assembly facilities.\nAt Apple\u2019s onsite environmental \ntesting lab, chemists assess \nproducts for harmful chemicals.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   47 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
