{"page_content": "Better Together\nThe challenges we\u2019re tackling\u2014like powering a global business with 100 percent renewable \nenergy, or making products using only recycled or renewable materials\u2014are too big for any  \none company to solve alone. So we listen. We speak. We convene. We advocate. We lead.  \nWe learn. And we engage at all levels: locally, nationally, and internationally; and with policymakers, \nresearchers, non-governmental organizations, other companies, and our customers. Every \nconversation, every meeting, and every presentation brings us closer to unlocking more \nenvironmental innovations that we\u2014and others\u2014can apply. Because bold ideas and creative \nsolutions can emerge anywhere, from anyone, at any time.\nMore partnerships. More progress.\nWe work with a wide range of nonprofit, industry, government, and business partners from \nacross the globe. We\u2019ve built strong relationships with a broad group of stakeholders, including \nthose who might disagree with our approach. We do this because we believe that addressing \ntheir concerns often leads to better solutions. Exposing ourselves to varied perspectives  \nhelps us challenge our assumptions and refine our methods. That\u2019s critical when you\u2019re \npursuing a vision that\u2019s as bold and complex as ours: to one day make products without taking \nfrom the Earth.\nJoining industry associations allows us to work closely with some of the best companies across \nall sectors. Our memberships in organizations like the World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment (WBCSD), World Economic Forum\u2019s Platform for Accelerating Circular Economy, \nEllen MacArthur Foundation, Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, Ceres, Corporate Eco Forum, \nthe Chinese Association of Circular Economy, Digital Europe\u2014and most recently, the Japan \nClimate Leaders Partnership\u2014provide us the opportunity to exchange ideas with those who \nshare our commitment to a more sustainable future.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   51 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
