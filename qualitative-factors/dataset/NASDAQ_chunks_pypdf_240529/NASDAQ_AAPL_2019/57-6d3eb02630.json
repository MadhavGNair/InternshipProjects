As is typical, these emissions are tracked separately from our 100 percent renewable energy claim. Starting in fiscal year 2016, Scope 1 emis -\nsions capture diesel use in emergency back-up generators and propane gas use in corporate offices. Scope 1 emissions are calculated using emissions factors from EPA clean energy website https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/\ncenter-corporate-climate-leadership-ghg-emission-factors-hub.\nScope 2 emissions result from electricity use for Apple\u2019s facilities, calculated using a market-based approach, following the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n*  Apple also calculates what our emissions would have been had we not taken action to supply new, clean renewable energy to our facilities. If we remove the emissions reduction benefits of our renewable energy program, then \nour Scope 1 emissions in fiscal year 2018 would have been 95,636 metric tons CO\u2082e and our Scope 2 emissions would have been 698,944 CO\u2082e for our corporate operations, data centers, and retail stores. In fiscal year 2018, \ncombustion of biogas for our fuel cells resulted in 41,040 metric tons of direct CO\u2082e emissions. The biogas fuel cells are included in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since they are within our operational control and their \nrenewable certificates are matched with our data center load. These emissions are not counted in Apple\u2019s footprint because they would have occurred naturally even if we had not combusted the biogas.\n**   The building operations and cooling emissions (PUE) associated with our colocated data facilities are beyond our operational control and therefore these emissions are not included in our report.   \n*** Emissions from R&D processes.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   58 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
