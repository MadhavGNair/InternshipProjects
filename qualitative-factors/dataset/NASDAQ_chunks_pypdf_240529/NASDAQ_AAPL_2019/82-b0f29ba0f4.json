Where appropriate, this approach follows \nmethodological principles applied for state -of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments.   \nThis review comprises a check of packaging plastic  data for selec ted products  (iPhone  X, \niPhone 8 Plus  MacBook  13\u201d Air). \nPlausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail. \nCorrections were made accordingly . Similarly, s cope for the packaging plastic and fibre \nfootprint have been discussed . Including ink use of photobooks in future footprints is \nsuggested for consistency between plastic and fibre  footprint , although t he impact on the \noverall packaging plastic footprint is expected to be low.  \nThis review was done remotely.  All questions rais ed in the course of the review were \nanswered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.   \n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   83 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 82, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
