All \nreviewed LCA studies up to now cover in total 67,9%  of the total scope 3 carbon footprint. \nAll questions raised in the course of the review we re answered by Apple and related \nevidence was provided where needed. \n4 Conclusions \nApple\u2019 assessment approach is excellent in terms of  granularity of the used calculation \ndata. A significant share of components is modelled with accurate primary data from \nApple\u2019s suppliers.  \nFor all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worst-\ncase approach has been followed and results have be en calculated with rather conservative \nestimates.   \nThe review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the carbon footprint data \nlevel that indicate the scope 3 carbon footprint ha s been materially misstated. The excellent \nanalysis meets the principles of good scientific pr actice.    \nBerlin, April 3, 2019 \n   \n- Karsten Schischke -  - Marina Proske - \nFraunhofer IZM  Fraunhofer IZM \nDept.
