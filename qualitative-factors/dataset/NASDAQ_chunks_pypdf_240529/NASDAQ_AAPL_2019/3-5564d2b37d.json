{"page_content": "We\u2019ve embarked on a bold mission to make products without taking from the \nEarth. Getting there requires focus and innovation in three key areas:\nClimate change:  We take responsibility for the emissions associated with our \nown operations, as well as the entire lifecycle of all our products and accessories.  \nResources: We believe in conserving Earth\u2019s resources when operating our \nfacilities and making our products.  \nSmarter chemistry:  We believe that our products should be safe for anyone \nwho assembles, uses, or recycles them.Our ambition:  \nto make products \nwithout taking \nfrom the Earth. \nClimate change      \n \n                 Resources\nSmarter chemistryEnergy efficiency  \nReduce energy use \nat corporate and \nsupplier facilities Low-carbon design  \nTransition product \nmaterials, manufacturing \nprocesses, and operating \nsystems to low-carbon \nalternatives\nMapping and \nengagement   \nCreate a comprehensive \ninventory of chemicals \nused by suppliers to \nmake our productsAssessment and  \nmanagement  \nAssess and manage chemicals \nfor risks to human health and  \nthe environmentInnovation  \nTransition to safer \nchemistries through \nchemical innovations, \nbeyond what is required  Materials  \nTransition to recycled or \nrenewable materials in our \nproducts and maximize \nmaterial efficiency, product \nlongevity, and recovery\nWater stewardship  \nReduce freshwater use, \nimprove the quality of \nwater we discharge, and \ndemonstrate leadership \nby protecting shared \nwater resources\nZero waste  \nEliminate waste sent to \nlandfill at manufacturing \nfacilities as well as \ncorporate offices,  \ndata centers, and  \nretail stores Our \nenvironmental \nstrategyRenewable energy  \nTransition Apple and \nour suppliers to 100% \nrenewable energy\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   4 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\nIntroduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 3, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
