{"page_content": "Sourcing recycled and renewable materials. \nWe aim to end our reliance on mining. That\u2019s why we are transitioning to recycled16 and \nrenewable materials, and maximizing material efficiency, all while maintaining the exceptional \nquality and finish of our final products.\nWith such a broad ambition, we needed a robust, data-driven way to determine where to start. \nSo we assessed 45 elements and raw materials based on their environmental, social, and \nsupply impacts. The resulting Material Impact Profiles helped us identify a short list of materials \non which to focus first. And we continue to use these profiles to determine which materials to \ntackle next.\nEach material requires a different solution. For some, like rare earth elements, recycled \nmaterial is not widely available. So simply understanding the barriers to recovery requires \nsignificant exploration, and the learning represents meaningful progress. For other materials, \nlike tin, recycled material markets are more robust. So we piloted uses of recycled tin in select \napplications and brought them to scale. Throughout these explorations and across many \nmaterials, we\u2019ve deepened our relationships with downstream recyclers. And we\u2019ve partnered \nwith suppliers further upstream to use fewer materials and find alternative, recycled sources.\nSupplier responsibility\nWe hold ourselves and our suppliers to \nthe highest standards when it comes to \nhuman rights, environmental protection, \nand health and safety practices in our \nsupply chain\u2014including for sourcing  \nof materials.
