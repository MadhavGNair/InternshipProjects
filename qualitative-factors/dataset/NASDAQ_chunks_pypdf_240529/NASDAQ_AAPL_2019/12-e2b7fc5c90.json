And as we continue to grow our global \noperations, we\u2019ll continue building projects in new markets.\nFor example, in Taiwan we worked with a local partner to build a rooftop PV system and \nsecured a long-term contract for Apple to own the project\u2019s renewable energy certificates.  \nWe will verify our purchase by using Taiwan\u2019s newly created T-REC tracking system.\nAggregation.\nWe\u2019re investing in large-scale renewable energy projects in the Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic \nregions totaling 245 megawatts of generation: an Illinois wind farm and a Virginia solar PV \narray. These projects will cover our electricity use at our retail stores and offices on the \nEast Coast, as well as co-located data facilities in Chicago, Illinois, and Ashburn, Virginia. In \naddition, we\u2019ve directly helped other companies access the same high-quality renewables that \nApple is procuring. By working with others, we can help open the renewable energy market to \ncompanies of all sizes and accelerate the pace of new renewable generation.\nSubsidy-free projects.\nAs renewable energy markets around the world evolve and the technology becomes more \ncost-competitive, we\u2019re looking to develop projects without the government subsidies that \nwere designed to encourage development of renewable energy. This will enable us to retain \nownership of the renewable energy credits of projects we invest in. In Denmark we contracted \nfor a new wind farm and a 42-megawatt solar PV project\u2014one of Denmark\u2019s largest\u2014using a \ncommercially backed contract-for-difference power purchase agreement, the first of its kind  \nin Denmark.\nIn China, we\u2019re working to create cost-competitive, subsidy-free renewable energy solutions for \nour facilities and suppliers. To encourage this transition, we supported China\u2019s voluntary REC \nmarket with the largest purchase to date, and kept our retail stores and corporate offices at  \n100 percent renewable in the process.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   13 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
