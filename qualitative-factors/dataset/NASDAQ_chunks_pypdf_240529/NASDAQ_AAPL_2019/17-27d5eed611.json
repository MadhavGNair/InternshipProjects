{"page_content": "Low-Carbon Design \nLowering emissions through \nproduct design.\nWe design our products with great care to reduce their carbon footprint. We think about how to \nmake them powerful while using as little energy as possible. We use materials efficiently, and \nwe source from materials that have a low-carbon profile.\nDesigning our products to use less energy. \nEnergy efficient products not only maximize battery life, but they\u2019re better for the environment, \ntoo. We establish aggressive efficiency targets early in the design phase, and we consistently \noutperform ENERGY STAR, which sets the standard across commercial products in the U.S. \nIn the last 10 years, we\u2019ve decreased average product energy use by 70\u00a0percent across all \nApple\u2019s major product lines.4 For example, the 11-inch iPad Pro introduced in fall 2018 is  \n69 percent more efficient than the ENERGY STAR standard. MacBook Air with Retina display \nconsumes three times less power in sleep mode than the previous-generation MacBook Air. \nWhen you multiply these reductions by all the Apple devices in the world, the impact on our \ncarbon footprint really adds up.\n69 %\nThe 11-inch iPad Pro models are more than \n69 percent more efficient than the ENERGY \nSTAR standard.\n40 %\niMac Pro consumes 40 percent less power \nduring sleep and off mode\u2014the result of \nan innovation in power supply design.15\n3X\nMacBook Air with Retina display consumes \nthree times less power in sleep than the \nprevious-generation MacBook Air.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   18 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
