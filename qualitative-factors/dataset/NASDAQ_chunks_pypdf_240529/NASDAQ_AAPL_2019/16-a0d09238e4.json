The maps below represents long-term \ncommitments to new renewable energy projects supporting 66 percent of Apple facilities, our suppliers, and cleaner grids around the world.*\nTo reduce our own electricity footprint (Scope 2 emissions), Apple currently has 28 operational renewable energy projects across nine countries on four continents, \ntotaling 629 megawatts of generation capacity. And we have 15 more projects under construction. Once they\u2019re built, we\u2019ll have over 1.5 gigawatts of clean renewable \nenergy generation spread across 12 countries and five continents. For some of our European loads, we procure electricity from utilities that only supply 100 percent \nrenewable energy, and from our two renewable energy projects in Denmark.\nTo address emissions from manufacturing products, Apple and our suppliers have invested in or procured from 1.9 gigawatts of grid-connected projects, with another \n3.3 gigawatts in development. These projects apply a mix of clean energy technology including wind (67 percent) and solar (23 percent).\n*  The map does not include REC and Guarantee of Origin purchases, certain utility clean energy programs, short-term contracts, and projects that are not yet sited.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   17 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
