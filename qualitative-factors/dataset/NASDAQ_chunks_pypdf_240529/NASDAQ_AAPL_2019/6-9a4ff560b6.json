The electricity at all of our facilities worldwide, including every Apple \noffice, store, and data center, comes from 100 percent renewable energy\u2014a standard we have \nmaintained, even as we continue to grow. And we\u2019re doing even more to transition our suppliers to \n100 percent renewable energy and make our products of low-carbon materials.\nEmissions reductions\nWe\u2019ve significantly reduced our carbon \nemissions: by 64% since 2011 for \nApple\u2019s direct operations (Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions) and by 35% for Apple\u2019s entire \nfootprint since it peaked in 2015. Supplier clean energy\n44 Apple suppliers have committed to \npower all of their Apple production with \n100% renewable energy. With these \npledges, we are on track to far exceed \nour 2020 goal to bring 4 gigawatts of \nnew clean energy into our supply chain.  \nComponent reductions\nIn the last year, we\u2019ve reduced emissions \nfrom aluminum in our products by 45%. \n100% renewable energy\nWe\u2019re sourcing 100% renewable energy \nfor all the electricity used at our facilities \nin 43 countries around the world. Two-\nthirds of this renewable energy comes \nfrom Apple-created projects.  Product energy efficiency\nIn 10 years, we\u2019ve reduced average \nproduct energy use by 70%.4\nFacilities energy efficiency\nWe saved 41.5 million kilowatt-hours  \n(kWh) through energy efficiency \ninitiatives at our global facilities.Highlights\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   7 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
