In fiscal year 2018, these include \nelectricity transmission and distribution losses (21,500 metric tons CO 2e) and lifecycle emissions associated \nwith renewable energy (78,000 metric tons CO 2e).\n6  We are constantly revisiting our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability standards. So in fiscal \nyear 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions from business travel in order to better account for classes \nof service in air travel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions increased by 77 percent. \nWithout the methodology change, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflects the \ngrowth in our business.7   We adjusted our methodology for fiscal year 2017 to take into account Apple\u2019s \u201cAt Home Advisors\u201d program, \nwhere employees work remotely. \n8  Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively \nsince 2011. All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the \nClaifornia Energy Commission. \n9  We calculate our progress toward 100 percent renewable energy on a calendar year basis. Beginning January 1, \n2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our global facilities is sourced from renewable energy. \n10  We have adjusted previous years\u2019 avoided emissions to remove double counting biogas emissons.\n11 Beginning in fiscal year 2017, \u201cData centers\u201d includes water use at colocation facilities. \n12  Beginning in fiscal year 2017, \u201cCorporate\u201d includes water use at Apple distribution centers.\n13  Beginning in fiscal year 2017, we\u2019re including waste from Apple\u2019s distribution centers. Starting fiscal year 2018, \nelectronic waste is reported under the \u201cRecycled\u201d figure.\n14 Beginning in fiscal year 2017, waste processed in \u201cWaste to energy\u201d facilities is reported separately.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   56 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 55, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
