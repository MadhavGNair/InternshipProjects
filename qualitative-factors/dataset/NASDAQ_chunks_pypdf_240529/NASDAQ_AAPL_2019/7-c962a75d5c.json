That includes the emissions beyond our \ndirect control, like those from sourcing materials, making our products, and our customers \nusing their devices. We calculate our carbon footprint in five major areas: corporate facilities, \nproduct manufacturing, product use, product transportation, and product end-of-life \nprocessing. We use this information to tell us where to focus. \nWe prioritize use of renewable energy, starting with our own facilities. We\u2019ve transitioned \nto 100 percent renewable energy for the electricity we use at our offices, retail stores, and \ndata centers around the world, which has reduced facilities emissions to only 2 percent of \nour comprehensive carbon footprint.5 And we\u2019ve extended our efforts into our supply chain, \nwhere product manufacturing represents 74 percent of overall emissions. Whether designing \na product, an operating system, or a manufacturing process, we consider the environmental \nimpact\u2014alongside cost, durability, form, and functionality. And because the cleanest energy \nis the energy you never use, we\u2019re reducing energy use at facilities we operate as well as those \nwhere our suppliers make our products.\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   8 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
