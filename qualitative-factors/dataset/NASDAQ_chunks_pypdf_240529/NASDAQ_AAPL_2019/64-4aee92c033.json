{"page_content": "Solar\nNewark, California\nOur data center in Newark, California, is powered by 100 percent renewable energy. We hit \nthis milestone in January 2013, when we began serving the data center with energy sourced \nprimarily from California wind power. We\u2019re acquiring this energy directly from the wholesale \nmarket through California\u2019s Direct Access program. In 2017, Apple\u2019s 130-megawatt California \nFlats solar project in nearby Monterey County came online, and now we use Direct Access to \nsupply power from that project directly to our data center as well as other Apple facilities  \nin California.\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Newark data center was supported by projects that generated  \n114 million kWh of renewable energy, which is equivalent to the energy used by 17,150 \nCalifornia homes.2\nNewark, California\u2014100% renewable since January 2013 \n114 million kWh energy use in fiscal year 2018 \nPacific Gas & Electric Default Grid Mix Apple Actual Renewable Energy Use\nNatural Gas 20% Bundled Solar (via Direct Access) 100%\nNuclear 27%\nLarge Hydro 18%\nUnspecified 2%\nRenewable 33%\n2018 Default Emissions \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)7,570 2018 Effective Emissions  \n(mtons CO\u2082e/year)0\nhttps://www.energy.ca.gov/pcl/labels/2017_labels/PG_\nand_E_2017_PCL.pd fActual fiscal year 2018 energy data\n2  Carbon emissions equivalences calculated using U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2017 data:  \nhttps://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf .\n2019 Environmental Responsibility Report   65 Introduction Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Resources Better Together", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2019.pdf", "page": 64, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
