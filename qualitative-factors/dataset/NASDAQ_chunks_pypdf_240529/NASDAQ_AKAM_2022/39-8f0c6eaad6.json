They do this by cleaning wastewater using a zero-waste algal process.\nAgromorph\u2019s proprietary technology harnesses the power of algae. They \nintend to install decentralized and large-grid eco-friendly wastewater treatment units, allowing any facility to recycle more than 95% of its wastewater and convert it to chemical-free fresh water.Solinas Integrity\nSolinas Integrity is a water and sanitation robotics company founded by \nalumni and professors of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) to assess pipeline conditions and eliminate manual scavenging. The team specializes in developing remotely controlled tethered and untethered robots that can enter pipelines and tanks, perform inline inspections, and make a conditional assessment of the assets\u2019 integrity.\nThe management of water pipeline waste and contaminations is highly \nunorganized and manually managed. This causes numerous problems for end users and pipeline companies. Through Solinas\u2019 intervention, they hope to reduce contamination and waste of treated water from pipelines.\nPhoto Taken by Solinas \nIntegrity - Water Robot\nPhoto taken by Agromorph Mumbai - Waste water treatment installation\n40", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 39, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
