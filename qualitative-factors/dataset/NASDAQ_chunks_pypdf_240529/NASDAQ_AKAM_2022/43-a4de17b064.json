{"page_content": "Environmental / 10 Sustainability Advocacy\nSustainability and States\nOn July 25, 2022, Akamai participated in educating new decision-makers in \nVirginia Governor Glenn Youngkin\u2019s administration around issues of climate and clean energy policy. The topics included the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). One of the key discussion tracks was focused on encouraging state investment of federal infrastructure funds in energy efficiency projects across the commonwealth.\nWe are also advocating for clean energy policies close to home. In \nMassachusetts, as elsewhere, buildings are a leading source of GHG emissions that harm our climate. In 2022, we advocated for legislation in Massachusetts that would promote greater efficiency for buildings statewide. One policy lawmakers are considering involves tracking pollution emitted by large building owners. We believe this policy should be included in any climate bill considered by the legislature in order to help companies evaluate their energy use and set new targets for reducing waste. \n Clean Energy Demand Initiative \nAkamai is an active supporter of the Clean Energy Demand Initiative (CEDI) sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. CEDI creates a connected cloud to connect countries and companies seeking to rapidly deploy clean energy to offset electrical demand in their sectors. The initiative is focused on partnering with companies and governments worldwide to expand access to affordable and reliable clean energy, promote regional energy security, decarbonize in line with climate goals, and create open, efficient and transparent energy markets. In 2022, we signed several CEDI statements regarding Akamai\u2019s development of renewable energy in Thailand, the Philippines and Australia.\n44", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 43, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
