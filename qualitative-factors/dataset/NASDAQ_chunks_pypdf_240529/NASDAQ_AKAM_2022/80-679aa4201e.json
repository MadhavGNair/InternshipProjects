A2M4Tech addresses institutional barriers that have long slowed progress in achieving equity in computer science.

In 2022, we continued to support them and help build out aspects of the program, with the first cohort enrolling in September 2022.\nStudent at Northeastern University - Photo provided by Joseph Harari, Success \nCoach at A2M4Tech\nThe Akamai scholarship is an investment in my future education and \nmy dream of chasing a better life for myself, my family, and society as I aspire to become a cybersecurity professional.
