{"page_content": "We intend to achieve our goal of powering Akamai\u2019s global operations \nwith 100% renewable energy by putting net new renewable energy on the grid whenever possible. We aim to achieve this with investment in purchaser-caused renewable energy like power purchase agreements (PPA) or virtual power purchase agreements (vPPA). This allows us to obtain bundled renewable energy credits to contribute to our operations.\nDue to the global footprint of Akamai Connected Cloud, we must rely on \nenergy sources from around the world, including in regions where renewable energy isn\u2019t always reliable or readily accessible. Where we can\u2019t source purchaser-caused renewable energy or work directly with a colocation partner, we intend to procure renewable power as close to our operations as possible through meaningful utility, supplier, or other market-based options that provide traceable renewable energy certificates, such as Green-e \ncertification or those that meet mandatory compliance standards.\nRenewable Colocation Partnerships\nWe rely heavily on our data center partners to provide renewable energy to power our operations. Akamai is fortunate to work with data center providers who share our concern about environmental impact. We aim to prioritize working with those that pass through renewable energy to power our operations. According to Akamai Connected Cloud data as of December 2022, more than 82% of our network deployment resides in our leased colocation partner facilities, we believe our combined efforts have had a significant impact. \n \nRenewable Energy MixEnvironmental / 03 Renewable Energy\nNon-Renewable Grid PowerGrid Mix RenewableRenewable DC PartnersAkamai Renewable Power\n22", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
