The Akamai Foundation\u2019s grant supports the Hakersi project, organized by the Sarigato Foundation, which organizes remote and in person classes for kids to participate in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) programs in Minecraft Edu Edition. As part of these sessions, children learned cooperation, creative problem solving, planning and digital literacy, and foundational skills necessary for STEM workplaces. Children from Poland and Ukraine participated in the project, creating a school of the future, an amusement park, and a campsite where in-game boating competitions were held.Social / Foundation / 04 Foundation Grants\nGroup of kids at a stationary class - Provided by Iwoda Duda from Sarigato \nFoundation\nI really enjoyed the class where we built and learned in Minecraft. In a \ngroup of four, we built the city of the future together. I was responsible for inventing a modern way of delivering food to the city, but in the end, after talking with the group, we came to the conclusion that it\u2019s good to eat organic food and everyone [needed] their own garden. We planned together, discussed what is needed to implement our ideas. I really enjoyed it and would like to participate in such a project again.\u201d\nKsawier W.  \n14, program participant\n76", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 75, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
