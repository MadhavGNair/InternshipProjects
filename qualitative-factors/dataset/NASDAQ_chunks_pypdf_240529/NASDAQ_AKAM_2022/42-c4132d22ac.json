That\u2019s why in 2022 we participated in LEAD On Climate. This major event brought together hundreds of business leaders and investors to advocate that U.S. lawmakers pursue robust federal climate action. Participants called on Congress to meet the urgency of the climate crisis with investments to transition to affordable, secure, domestic clean energy; seize the economic opportunities to lead the world in clean energy production; and address inequity by targeting clean energy investments in disadvantaged, rural, and frontline energy communities. Akamai looks forward to building on this momentum and continuing to advocate for policies that enhance sustainability.\nClimate Action Meeting with       \nC\nOP26 President\nAkamai participated in a private conversation with COP26 President Alok Sharma; Dr. Peter Abbott OBE, British Consul General in Boston; and other senior business leaders from Massachusetts on net-zero leadership in the private sector and the challenges around international climate finance.  \nThis was a unique opportunity to discuss the global climate movement with \none of the world\u2019s most connected and influential climate leaders and hear more about the U.K.\u2019s Presidency of COP26, six months after Glasgow.\nPictured left to right: \nDr. Peter Abbott, British Consul General in Boston; Mike Mattera, Director of Corporate Sustainability and ESG Officer for Akamai; Alok Sharma, President of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference - Photo taken by the British Consul General office in Boston, MA\n43", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
