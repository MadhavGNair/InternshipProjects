{"page_content": "Environmental / 07 Engaging Employees to Reach Our Goals\nLaunch of the Green Team\nThe highlight of Akamai Earth Month 2022 was the launch of the Akamai \nGreen Team. The team is a global community of employees passionate about Akamai\u2019s sustainability efforts. According to data collected on February 28, 2023, since its launch, the community has gained 904 members, with nine leaders directing local action around the globe. The Green Team has enabled us to offer our employees a stake in our corporate goals and actions. They\u2019ve embraced this eagerly by engaging in educational programming, inviting colleagues to join the team and creating events of their own. Throughout the year, Green Team leaders and members created various campaigns on Akamai Spark, our internal communications platform, to engage their colleagues with community-focused activities in their home cities like Chicago, Cambridge, Krakow, Munich, San Jos\u00e9, and Bangalore. Based on its first year, we\u2019re excited to see what the Green Team has in store for the future.\nPhoto taken by Yen Mattera during a water clean up in Cambridge, Massachusetts\n36", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
