{"page_content": "Environmental / 04 Efficiency Program\nWith continued growth in capacity and our approach to improving our \nmeasurement techniques since 2018, we have seen a year-over-year reduction in our reported emissions output. Akamai has historically measured our impact against our hardware\u2019s theoretical max power output to ensure we were not shortchanging our emissions budget. As a result, we have seen emissions reductions year over year due to increased efficiency, improvements in power measurement, data collection, and our renewable energy program. With the continued growth of the delivery and security businesses of Akamai Connected Cloud, we recognize that our operations are very dynamic. As our operations continue to grow, we must continue to refine our measurement capabilities to clearly understand our year-over-year emissions impact.\nHardware Efficiency Highlights\nIn 2022, we took great steps to improve the frequency management of our Central Processing Units (CPUs), especially when machines are not being used. This enables the underlying software to scale the CPU frequency up or down in order to save power or improve performance. Scaling can be done automatically in response to system load, adjusting itself in response to ACPI events, or it can be manually changed by user space programs.Emission Impact to Capacity Growth\nEmission Output (Scope 2) Capacity Growth YOY2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 202210%20%40%\n30%\n0100,000\n50,000150,00050% 200,000\n0%0%33%\n12%30%40%160,000168,500182,500\n154,300144,400\n105,100104,000\n92,000\n17%42%\n25%\nData as of 12/31/22 from the Akamai Data Warehouse \nand Akamai emissions factors database\n29", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
