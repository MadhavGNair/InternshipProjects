That\u2019s why we created the Carbon Calculator, a tool that shows an estimated calculation of the emissions produced by an individual customer\u2019s actual use of Akamai Connected Cloud delivery and security services.\nIntegrated into the Akamai Control Center, the Carbon Calculator provides \nan estimate of the emissions associated with a specific subset of customer traffic for a specified date range, from the last 48 hours to a period of up to three months. Customers can see at a glance the total bytes delivered and the calculated emissions in grams, kilograms and metric tonnes of CO2 equivalency. The information reported by the calculator also provides a view of estimated emissions by country, color-coded by the volume of bytes and emissions, from low to high.\nThe Carbon Calculator is an innovative tool for meeting our commitment \nto keeping Akamai customers informed and engaged on the issue of emissions reduction.Environmental / 02 Net-Zero Emissions\nCalculated Emissions and Edge Bytes by Geography Calculated Emissions and Edge Bytes\nTotal Calculated Emissions\nTotal Edge Bytes108.84 Kilograms\n3.15 Petabytes\n20kg10kg0kg\n30kg\n40kg\n20", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
