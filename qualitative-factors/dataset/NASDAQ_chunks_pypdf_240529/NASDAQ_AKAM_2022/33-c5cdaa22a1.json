{"page_content": "Lifecycle Management\nAkamai partners with e-Stewards-certified recycling partners such as NCS \nGlobal to provide critical Lifecycle Management Services (LMS) for our global operations. The LMS process provides opportunities to reuse and redeploy hardware assets that still have a useful life.\nImplementing LMS across Akamai\u2019s operations has helped us extend the useful \nlife of our hardware assets and has contributed to increased efficiencies across our operational footprint. On average, Akamai has extended the useful life of its assets delivered through LMS by approximately two to three years. \nFor example, in 2022, Akamai worked closely with NCS to identify and process \nSSD drives across our global footprint deemed end-of-life and otherwise destined for recycling and ultimately scrap material. As a result, NCS processed and tested over 21,000 drives and successfully repurposed more than 14,000 of them to put back into Akamai\u2019s inventory for use across our business. This process helped us repurpose drives with a useful life while reducing the power and work cycles needed to recycle the raw materials from those drives. We saw an improvement of over 16,000 pounds of CO2e avoided from repurposing drives rather than if we had purchased new ones. As a commitment to our e-waste goal, we will continue to work with our partners like NCS to look for ways Akamai can continue to make a difference in the recycling phases of renew and reuse.\n Environmental / 06 E-Waste Recycling Program\nLifecycle Management Services \nService\nProcess\nWork \nIdenti\ufb01ed\nSent to\nRecycling\nPartner\nLMS Process Flow\nOptions\nAccessed\nResale\nWarranty\nReplacement\nRecycle\nField\nMatching Part\nReplacement\nPart Sent\nRefurbish for\nMatching Part\nInventory\nPart Arrives at\nService\nTicket\n34", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
