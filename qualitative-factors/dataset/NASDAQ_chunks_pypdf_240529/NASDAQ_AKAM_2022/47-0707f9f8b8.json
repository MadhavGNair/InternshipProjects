{"page_content": "Khalil SmithOur Year\nVice President of Inclusion,\nDiversity, and EngagementSocial / Headline Title\nReflecting on a year\u2019s worth of effort, results, and memories is one of my favorite exercises. \nPausing to recognize all that we\u2019ve accomplished, while realizing all we have yet to do, is both empowering and humbling.  \nOur company\u2019s purpose, to make life better for billions of people, billions of times a day, is a \ntremendous opportunity, and it is one that we can\u2019t do without the nearly 10,000 employees that make up Akamai\u2019s global workforce. While Akamai is making online experiences safer and more secure through our platform and services, we are simultaneously trying to build an employee-centric community. Our customers succeed because our employees succeed. Our brand is strong because our employees make it so. Our technology is best in class because our workforce is best in class. The tie between our people and our performance is clear and unambiguous. \nOur people care about the environment in which we work, and also the environment in which \nwe live. We care about our neighbors at Akamai and our neighbors at home. We\u2019ve listened to our employees and chosen not to be a remote-first company, or an office-first company, but to be an employee-first company. I am clear about the fact that the very nature of work is changing. What it means to be a great workplace is shifting, along with the ways we continue to be an inclusive and diverse workforce where employees are engaged and excited. I hope you\u2019ll join us in celebrating the efforts we make not only to keep up with the changes at work, but to embrace them.Social / Our People / 01 Our Year\nKhalil Smith\n48", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 47, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
