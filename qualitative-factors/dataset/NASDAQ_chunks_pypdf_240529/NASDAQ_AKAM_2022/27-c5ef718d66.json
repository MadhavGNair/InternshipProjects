{"page_content": "Watt power measurements also help us determine and understand \nhardware efficiencies beyond the avoided data center deployment and machine count we currently look at. This helps us better understand the impact of additional efficiencies and software improvements happening across the delivery and security services running on Akamai Connected Cloud in a closer to real-time way. As we continue to grow this practice, we intend to incorporate more granular measurements of our total power and localized emissions impact.\nEfficiency Improvements\nAs the Akamai delivery and security businesses of Akamai Connected Cloud grow, it would be expected that this growth would translate into increased power consumption even with the efficiencies our engineering teams are working to implement. However, in 2022 we increased our gigabit per second (Gbps) of Akamai Connected Cloud capacity by an estimated 25% while decreasing our power requirements by appoximately 47% and our emissions output by 29% per Gbps, according to Akamai Connected Cloud metrics as of December 31, 2022.\nOur mission to power and protect life online comes to life in our \ncommitment to build a sustainable global platform. By reducing the impact of the power necessary to run our network, we are helping to create a sustainable future.
