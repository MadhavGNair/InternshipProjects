The Indus Diwali celebration saw 62 participants. The session on parental anger organized by Akamai\u2019s Parents ERG had 170 participants and the \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Menopause\u201d event run by the Global Women\u2019s Forum gathered 150 participants. Our amazing Military Veterans ERG, which grew by over 43% in 2022, also hosted a Memorial Day Challenge to honor the U.S. military personnel who have died while serving in the United States armed forces.\nFurthermore, we recognize the importance of fostering awareness around \nERGs in the Akamai community. As a result, we launched an ongoing internal campaign called \u201cThe ABCs of ERGs\u201d to help employees get to know the Employee Resource Groups. Within the ABCs program, employees can hear Akamai executives talking about the importance of ERGs and ERG Leaders describing their roles, and receive practical instructions on how to announce membership, change pronouns or add ID&E objectives into their yearly performance evaluations. So far the \u201cABCs of ERGs\u201d campaign received 1,600 user engagements in the form of likes, comments, questions and meeting participation. This level of involvement demonstrates employee desire for content of this nature and provides a great pathway for people to begin their ERG journey. To give the ERG Leaders opportunity to grow we launched the ERG Leadership Academy, a 10 session training course designed specifically for Akamai ERG Leaders. The course discusses topics like active membership, business alignment and active listening. We are confident that ERGs will continue to make a difference in Akamai\u2019s culture in 2023 and beyond.  \n\u201cEveryone\u2019s experiences were different\nbut challenges were similar.\u201d\n\u2014 Anonymous ERG Leaders Survey from May of 2022\nEmployee Programs \nOur ongoing employee programs enable us to feel the \u201cOne Akamai\u201d spirit. They create opportunities, support being productive and strengthen our business footprint. \n2022 was a very active year for Akamai\u2019s employee programs. Initiatives \nsuch as the Leadership Competencies and Influence program and the Leadership Development Program provided support for our employees while also equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge. The Leadership Competencies and Influence program focuses on providing executive learning solutions to senior managers and above.\n65", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 64, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
