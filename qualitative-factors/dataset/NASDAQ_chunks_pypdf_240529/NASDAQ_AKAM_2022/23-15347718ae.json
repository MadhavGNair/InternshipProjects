{"page_content": "Active Clean Energy Projects\nUnderstanding our renewable abatement impact helps us to make \nmeaningful progress towards our net-zero goals. With our ongoing incorporation of LMEs into our long-term approach, we can better understand the full impact of our renewable projects based on their hourly abatement over the 8,760 hours in a year. Getting to a highly precise measurement helps us track our progress and be more deliberate in reaching a net-zero future for Akamai.\nThe graphic on the right highlights each project\u2019s total MWh production \nduring 2022. It also includes two different emissions factors, including Market-based emissions values based on the project location and generation profile and the LME values, which highlight a closer-to-reality market abatement. Between the market-based emissions factor from the site location and LME values, we highlight the difference between the impact of each applied method. As we continue to form our emissions-first approach, we will look for innovative ways to use innovative emissions abatement measurements, such as LMEs, across our global footprint.Environmental / 03 Renewable Energy\nActive Clean Energy Projects\nData from REsurety\n24", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
