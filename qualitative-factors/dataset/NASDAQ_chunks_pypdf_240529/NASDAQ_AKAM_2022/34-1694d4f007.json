With this data we\u2019ve been able to create impactful programs focused on areas where employees experience the largest emissions impacts. Akamai created two carbon footprint campaigns to encourage employees to reduce their home and transportation emissions footprints and create sustainable habits to reduce their carbon footprints incrementally over time. \n Throughout Akamai Earth Month 2022, employees participated on an \nindividual, local, and global level to reduce their carbon impact. We engaged in a Home Office Challenge, community events and a global Earth Hour. With a predominately remote workforce, it\u2019s important for us to acknowledge the power demand of our home offices. We challenged employees to \u201cgreen up\u201d their home offices and calculate the carbon impact. Throughout the month, employees avoided an estimated 137,184 pounds of carbon and eliminated an estimated 2,164,283 pounds of carbon in total for 2022. We plan to continue these efforts in 2023.\n35", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
