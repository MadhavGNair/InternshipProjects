{"page_content": "Environmental / 04 Efficiency Program\nSoftware Efficiency:\nThe Evolution of Split Ghost\n  Ghost is the name of Akamai\u2019s edge server software and caching engine. \nAs the name suggests, Split Ghost is splitting the monolithic Ghost into a microservices architecture. The project has two main directions: splitting software (process separation) and splitting the edge server\u2019s content cache (region distributed cache).\nProcess separation helps address scaling issues with Ghost that result in \nunderutilized resources. Splitting compute and I/O-intensive activities helps eliminate stranded CPU and disk resources, improving efficiency. The region distributed cache project aims to redesign how the edge server cache is organized, eliminating capacity fragmentation to make more efficient use of server capacity, significantly reducing resource waste. \nSplit Ghost aims to significantly improve performance of content delivery \nwhile improving utilization of our server capacity. This can moderate our server count growth and, in turn, our long-term energy consumption growth rate.Our Process for Power Data Collection\nFront End Back EndComponent\nLevel Load\nBalancing\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer80% Feature\n20% Store\nHigh CPU\nHigh Memory\nLower DiskHigh CPU\nHigh MemoryHigh Disk20% Feature\n80% Store\nFeature Processing\nStore Processing\n30", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
