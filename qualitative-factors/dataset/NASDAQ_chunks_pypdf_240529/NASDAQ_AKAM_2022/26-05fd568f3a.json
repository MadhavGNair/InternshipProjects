We did this so we would not shortchange our emissions impact accounting for our deployments globally. In partnership with our data center practice and network systems team, Akamai aims to power data in 15-minute intervals to determine a closer to real-time impact of our hardware utilization. This has helped determine how machines are utilizing power given a network type or event, at a level of specificity that we did not have access to in the past. \nPower Consumption \nAverage per Machine (Wh) \nby Network, Region and \nHardware TypeOur Process for Power Data Collection\nData Collected\nTime Series\nMachine IP\nRegion\nNetwork\nHardware Type\nPower (watts)\nTop of\nRack Switch\nDistributed\nData CollectionPower\nAggregation\nDatabase\n(Time Series)Power Data\nCollectionServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServer\nServerRegion 1\nSample\nRegion 2\nSample15 Minute\nPoll (watts)PSU\n(watts)Rack\n27", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AKAM_2022.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
