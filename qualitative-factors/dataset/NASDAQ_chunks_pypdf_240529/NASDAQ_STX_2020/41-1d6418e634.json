{"page_content": "OUR EMPLOYEES OUR EMPLOYEESHuman Rights and Working Conditions \nProtecting and promoting labor standards and human rights is integral to our global operations. Seagate adheres \nto the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Labor Organization \ncore labor principles, and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. Each of these standards \nare incorporated into our own policies and procedures. Equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, and fair employment \npractices are also prioritized. As a material aspect of our business, protecting human rights and following labor \nstandards in all of our operations, including in geographies that lack the regulatory protection or enforcement to \nmanage concerns such as child labor, requires specific attention to the following: \nWe do not allow or condone \nany form of harsh or \ninhumane treatment.   \n \nSeagate strives to create, \nfoster and maintain a work \nenvironment that\u2019s free from \nharassment by proactively \nworking to prevent such \nbehavior. The company \nalso promptly responds to, \ninvestigates and addresses \nharassment complaints. Our Open Door policy and \nphilosophy encourages \nopen dialogue between \nemployees and managers.  \n \nIn addition to formal and \ninformal complaint or grievance \nprocedures, employees or \nother concerned parties have \neasy access to Seagate\u2019s \nglobal ethics and compliance \nhotline to report complaints  \nor concerns. Our policies oppose child \nlabor, and we do not use \nchild labor in any of our \nfacilities.   \n \nWe have established age \n18 as a standard minimum \nage for employment at all \nlocations, which complies \nwith or exceeds local legal \nrequirements. Through RBA \nValidated Audit Program \n(VAP) audits there have been \nno cases of child labor found \nin our operations, and our \ncontrols keep such cases  \nat a low risk. Our policies prohibit, and \nwe do not use any forced, \nbonded, indentured or other \ncompulsory labor.   \n \nWe also prohibit our suppliers \nfrom using any forced, \nbonded, indentured or other \ncompulsory labor. Through \nRBA VAP audits there have \nbeen no cases of forced labor \nfound in our operations, and \nour controls keep such cases \nat a low risk. We respect our employee\u2019s \nright to freedom of \nassociation in choosing \nlabor organizations to \nrepresent them.   \n \nWe strive to maintain positive \nrelationships with the unions, \nworks councils and employee \nassociations that represent \nmany of our employees. \nWorldwide, approximately 14 \npercent of our employees are \nrepresented by an employee \nrepresentative organization \nsuch as a union, works council \nor employee association. \nThrough RBA VAP audits \nthere have been no instances \nof violation of freedom of \nassociation found in our \noperations, and our controls \nkeep such cases at a low risk. Seagate operates with \nreasonable working hours \nand rest days to maintain a \npositive and productive work \nenvironment consistent with \nthe RBA code of conduct or \nlocal legislation, whichever \nsets the bar higher.   \n \nEmployees decide to accept \nemployment after being \nfully apprised of the terms, \nconditions, practices and \nexpectations of their jobs. \nWorkers are not required to \nsurrender government-issued \nidentification, passports or \nwork permits as a condition  \nof employment.COMMITMENT TO A  \nRESPECTFUL WORKPLACEPROHIBITION ON  \nFORCED LABOROPEN  \nCOMMUNICATIONPROHIBITION OF  \nCHILD LABORCONDITIONS OF  \nEMPLOYMENTFREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION\n82\nFY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report FY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report 83", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2020.pdf", "page": 41, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
