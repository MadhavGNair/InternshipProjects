We also work with our suppliers and \nkey stakeholders to educate them on sustainability best practices, measuring \ntheir own performance. \nThese actions comprise the majority of our environmental sustainability efforts. \nTo the best of our knowledge, no Seagate operations are owned, leased, \nmanaged in, or adjacent to protected areas and areas of high biodiversity \nvalue outside protected areas. \n06\n48\nFY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report FY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report 49", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2020.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
