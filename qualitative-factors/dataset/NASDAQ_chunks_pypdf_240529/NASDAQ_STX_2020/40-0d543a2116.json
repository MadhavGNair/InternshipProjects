{"page_content": "OUR EMPLOYEES OUR EMPLOYEESRecruiting/Hiring \nData reflects employee hires captured in our HR Management System during the reporting period and excludes agency temporary workers. \nHire rate is calculated as the number of hires divided by employee headcount. \nSeagate invests in the future by strategically recruiting \non campuses for interns with the goal of converting to \ngraduate hires. We focus on hiring technical and non-\ntechnical graduates from universities at our sites around \nthe world, and in FY2020 we hired 224 graduates. We \nregularly partner with campus minority organizations and \n50 percent of our events (15/30) in the US were specific \nto diversity outreach via campus organizations.  In FY2020, many of Seagate\u2019s \nspring and summer interns moved \nto a virtual work environment \ndue to COVID-19. We hired 322 \ninterns at our facilities globally and \nwhere feasible, interns worked \nremotely. Our internship program \noffers interns an opportunity \nto gain hands-on experience \nwithin an innovative and global \ncompany. During their time at \nSeagate, student interns gain \nvaluable industry experience and \ncontribute to many departments at \nthe company. These interns gain \nexposure to technology through \nproject-based work and at the \nconclusion of their projects, they \nprepare and present a summary \nof their internship for their group \nleadership and other relevant \nemployees. Interns were given \nvirtual exposure to leadership via VOLUNTARY TURNOVER \nRATE BY REGION VOLUNTARY TURNOVER  \nRATE BY GENDER VOLUNTARY TURNOVER \nRATE BY AGE GROUP \nAmericas 5.9% Females 8.3% <30 18.2%\nAsia 8.8% Males 8.1% 30-50 5.3%\nEMEA 3.2% <50 2.7%FY2020 Voluntary Turnover: 3,422 (Overall turnover rate 8.2%) HIRES RATE BY REGION HIRES RATE BY GENDER HIRES RATE BY AGE GROUP \nAmericas 9.5% Females 16.5% <30 41.9%\nAsia 17.5% Males 15.9% 30-50 8.3%\nEMEA 10.0% <50 4.8%FY2020 Global Employee Hires: 6,778 (Overall hire rate 16.3%) \nSeagate prioritizes retaining and developing our talented \nworkforce and sets an annual voluntary turnover goal  \nfor non-operator employees at 10 percent; in FY2020 \nwe met this goal. We define operators as \u201cDirect Labor  \nProduction Workers\u201d and non-operators as \u201call others.\u201d  \nSeagate offers transition services, such as pre-retirement \nplanning information and resources, for employees \nthat are leaving the workforce due to retirement. In the \nUnited States we provide outplacement services and in \nother countries, we align with legal mandates. Data reflects employee voluntary turnover captured in our HR Management System during the reporting period and excluded agency \ntemporary workers. Turnover rate is calculated as the number of voluntary terminations divided by employee headcount. \nLOOKING FORWARD: WORKFORCE AND TALENT  \nIn FY2021, we plan to continue to build employee skill sets through an internal mobility program. \nThis program is designed to make opportunities visible to employees who seek to build knowledge, \ngain experience and explore other career directions; build employee skills and confidence to pursue \nopportunities outside of their \u201cday jobs\u201d; and provide career coaching or a Talent Consultant to \nidentify growth areas for a fulfilling career path. For external hires, we will be enhancing the process \nto welcome and engage new employees within their first 30 days. \n\u201clunch & learn\u201d sessions, took an HDD 101 class, networked with each other \nthrough online social activities and were even offered a cooking class by the \nhead chef at our Longmont facility.
