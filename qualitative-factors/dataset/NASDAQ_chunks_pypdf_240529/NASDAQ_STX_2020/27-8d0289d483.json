Seagate measures \nScope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and shares our factory \nperformance results with our stakeholders annually \nin both our own report (the GCAR) and through the \nCDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure \nProject) investor and supply chain questionnaires. Our \nresponses are available on the CDP website and our \nown external webpage, and we share information with \nour customers through the RBA environmental module. \u2022 CDP Climate Change Response  \n\u2022 Third Party Verification  \nInformation on risks and opportunities posed by climate \nchange can also be found in our CDP Climate Change \nresponse. We continue to assess climate change \nrelated risks to the business as part of our annual ISO \n14001 management system process, and we have not \nidentified any risk unique to our company beyond what \nwould apply to our industry. See the CDP disclosure for \ndetails on risks and opportunities.\nRenewable energy is continually \nevaluated as part of our work in \nreducing GHG emissions. Our \nFremont, California design center \ngenerated 942.5 MWh of solar \nenergy in CY2019. The capacity \nof the system is 1MW; the total \namount generated, and the RECs \nare retained by Seagate.\n**Seagate adopts The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) to collect activity data and calculate emissions. The emission data \nare reported for Scope 1 and Scope 2 as per the World Resources Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate \nAccounting and Reporting Standard, and Scope 3 as per the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. \nOur GWP factors are based on IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 \u2013 100 year), and we scope our reporting for which we have operational control. Other gasses include CO2, CH4, N2O, \nHFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, 404A & 407C. Emission factors for the electricity use are using EPA\u2019s eGRID2018 for the US and IEA\u2019s \u201cCO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion\u201d (2013 Edition) for \noutside the US. \nWe also conduct third-party verification of our GHG emissions reporting, which is done every year per ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases\u2014Part 3: Specification with guidance for the \nvalidation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions. ** SCOPE CY2019 CY2018 CHANGE REASONS FOR CHANGE\nScope 1: \nEmissions (GHG emissions \ngenerated directly at our sites)262,445 metric \ntons of CO2e259,307 metric \ntons of CO2e1.21 percent\nincrease Increased consumption \nof natural gas and jet \nkerosene led to increase\nScope 2:  \nLocation based emissions: GHG \nemissions generated from the  \nelectricity that we purchase869,654 metric \ntons of CO2e890,010 metric \ntons of CO2e2.29 percent decreaseReductions driven by \nsite energy conservation \nScope 2: \nMarket based emissions: GHG \nemissions generated from the \nelectricity that we purchase 875,773 metric\ntons of CO2e902,266 metric\ntons of CO2e2.94 percent\ndecreaseReductions driven by \nsite energy conservation\nCombined Scope 1 and 2 Goal \n(SBT): \nReduce emissions by 20% by \nCY2025 and 60% by CY2040 \nfrom CY2017 base year1,132 thousand \nmetric tons 1,149 thousand \nmetric tons Overall we reduced our \nabsolute emissions by \n1.49 percent in CY2019 \nvs CY2018See above\nScope 3 emissions:\nIndirect GHG emissions that occur \nin our value chain, including both \nupstream and downstream emissions9,909,200 \nmetric tons \nCO2eTotal: \n16,790,400 \nmetric tons \nCO2e --Better LCA mapping with \nthe latest product profiles resulted \nin an emission adjustment of the \nuse of sold products and a new \nbaseline to model our emissionsScope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions ResultsCarbon Emissions\n54\nFY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report FY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report 55", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2020.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
