Without water, we could not clean products \nduring manufacturing or provide adequate cooling to \nfacilities and critical equipment. \nFreshwater is primarily used in direct operations and \nin our value chain as coolants and cleaning agents \nat production facilities, and is sourced from local \nwatersheds shared with the community. \nNote that all water noted in our charts and data callouts  \nis classified as Freshwater (\u2264 1,000 mg/L Total \nDissolved Solids) Wastewater produced from our operations is treated \nand discharged into waterways used for other \npurposes e.g. transportation and irrigation. Proper \ntreatment of water is also an important aspect of \nour operations to reduce the impact to downstream \nactivities. Seagate continues to apply measures to \nreduce water consumption, improve water recycling, \nincrease awareness among employees, and reduce \nwater intensity. Our water metrics are reported \nannually based on the calendar year, not fiscal year. \nOur CDP Water Security Response and Third-Party \nVerification can be found on our external Global \nCitizenship Website.\nCooling is our primary water use, with around 84 \npercent used for that purpose. We monitor use at our \nfacilities on an annual basis, and when actual data is \nnot available, we estimate consumptive use based on \navailable data from other facilities. Manufacturing sites \nand Seagate\u2019s largest R&D and administrative sites are \nprioritized for monitoring because they are the largest contributors to our water use. For smaller office-based \nsites, consumption is negligible. \nWe perform water risk assessments using the WRI \nAqueduct Tool and disclose information in our CDP \nwater disclosure questionnaire. Seagate\u2019s CDP Water \nDisclosure can be referenced for details.
