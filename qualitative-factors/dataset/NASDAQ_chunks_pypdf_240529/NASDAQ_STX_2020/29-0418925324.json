As \nproducts require more power and/\nor operate for longer periods of \ntime, the emissions also change. \nSeagate continues innovation in \nthis area to reduce the amount of \nenergy used by our products; by \nlearning from current products, \nwe can better design future ones \nto decrease emissions. Our LCA \nresults inform us of sustainability \nimpacts, including energy usage, \nalong with other improvement areas \nsuch as packaging.
