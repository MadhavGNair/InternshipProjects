Seagate recognizes the need to move away \nfrom the \u201ctake, make, dispose\u201d model into a more \nefficient, circular economy, and actively participates \nin circularity projects both internally and externally. In \nFY2020, a circularity pilot with Dell was operationalized, \nresulting in 1.6 tons of scrap magnets recycled. We  \nalso worked to improve our packaging, and made \nseveral changes in material types, recycled material,  \nand densification, all with the goal to save material  \nuse and energy.
