In China, \nSeagate funded the purchase of three fully equipped, \nnegative-pressure ambulances to Huang Gang Central \nHospital, Xishui County Hospital and Xishui County \nChinese Medicine Hospital, all in Huang Gang City, in \nhard-hit Hubei Province. In addition, proceeds from \nSeagate\u2019s Charity Golf Fund were used to purchase  \n60 electro-respirators and accessories for Wuhan Union \nHospital of China and the First People\u2019s Hospital of \nJiangxia, Wuhan.

At several Seagate sites, employees took \nthe initiative to create face shields using 3D printers. In \naddition, numerous food banks were supported with cash donations as social distancing isolated people \nand challenged food supply lines and access in \nvarious geographies. \nAn important aspect of Seagate4Good in FY2020 \nwas to focus on helping local economies weather the \nstorm. In China and Thailand respectively, Seagate \npurchased produce and milk from farmers who \ncouldn\u2019t sell their products, and had the foodstuffs \ndelivered to shelters, orphanages, and community \nsupport groups. In Fremont, California, Seagate \nhelped fund an e-gift card program in which residents \ncould shop at local small, independent businesses \nand get a bonus cash balance to increase their \npurchase. In Minnesota, local restaurants were tapped \nto supply some meals to employees working onsite. \nIn Springtown and Northern California, work continues \nin supporting online resources that help the elderly \nand isolated stay in touch with social services using \ntechnology. Seagate plans on sustaining some of the \nsupport services as COVID-19 continues to strain \ncommunity and educational capabilities. \nLOOKING FORWARD: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \nIn FY2021, Seagate will continue to focus on volunteer opportunities (as allowable within the COVID-19 \nenvironment) and programs that serve STEM learning, community wellbeing, and health and wellness. \nAs we anticipate ramifications from the COVID-19 pandemic, more resources will be used in providing \nhelp for local economies, health care workers, and hard-hit communities.\n102\nFY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report FY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report 103", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2020.pdf", "page": 51, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
