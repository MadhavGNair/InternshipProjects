We will also aim to minimize emissions through energy \nconservation activities, improved management of energy, and process controls. We anticipate saving \n10,000 MWh in FY2021 and anticipate Scope 1 and 2 emissions to total 1,152,000 metric tons of \nCO2e. These efforts all ladder up to our aggressive SBTi goals. Seagate also aims to have ISO 50001 \nimplemented in the remaining four manufacturing sites in FY2021.CY2019 Emissions of Ozone Depleting Substances and Nitrogen Oxides, \nSulfur Oxides and Other Significant Air Emissions \nIn CY2019, there were no ozone depleting substances \n(ODS) recognized under the Montreal Protocol used for \nproduction. However, there was a total of 0.04 metric \ntons of CFC equivalents used in test and development, \nand lab work. This data was based on in-house annual \nchemical inventory, which came from their relative \nozone depletion potential (ODP). Determined from \ndata generated and collected during an air emission \nmonitoring program, our total applicable significant \nair emissions concentration from our manufacturing \nfacilities were 17.5 mg/Nm3 SOx, 7,888 mg/Nm3 \nvolatile organic compounds (VOC) and 64.5 mg/\nNm3 particulate matter (PM). There was no NOx was \ndetected.
