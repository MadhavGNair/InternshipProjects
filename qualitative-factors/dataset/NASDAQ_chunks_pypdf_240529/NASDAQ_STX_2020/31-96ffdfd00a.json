{"page_content": "ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITYEach Seagate site has established systems to track, \nmanage and report waste of all types; any waste \nminimization initiatives undertaken have the goal of \npreventing waste from being produced, and recycling \nor reusing waste whenever possible. Waste is inevitable \nin the manufacturing process, making its management \na significant aspect of our operations. Proper \nmanagement is undertaken to reduce environmental \nimpact and generate the most benefit, and any \nprograms in place allow us to categorize different waste \nstreams, ensuring proper disposition in accordance with \nregulatory requirements.  \n \nTwo Main Types of Waste  \nNon-Hazardous Waste: Comprised of wood, paper, \ncardboard and plastics which are non-hazardous. \nHazardous Waste: Comprised of organic solvents, \nsludges, corrosives waste and e-waste.  We commit to zero landfill disposal of hazardous waste \nunless technically not feasible. In the case of disposal, \nwe work with the disposal facility to identify the most \nappropriate method for treatment and disposal. Our \npreference is to recycle waste whenever possible, but if \nthat is not an option, we look at chemical, then physical \ntreatment, and finally incineration. \nEach Seagate site reports data on waste to a central \ndatabase, accessible by employees and reviewed by \nour Sustainability team to ensure best practices are \nin use. Vendors are qualified through a third-party \naudit of set criteria, and we have established minimum \nrequirements for the selection and performance of \nhazardous waste treatment vendors.  \n \nSeagate had no significant spills (defined as one which \nis reported in the financials as a liability requiring outside \nresponse by a party external to Seagate) in FY2020.
