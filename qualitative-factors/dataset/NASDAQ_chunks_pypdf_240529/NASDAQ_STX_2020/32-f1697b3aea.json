Waste sent for \nlandfill contained asbestos \nfrom building renovation as \nthere was no other suitable \ntreatment method available. \nA smaller percentage of \nour hazardous waste was \nrecycled this year, but a \nlarger percentage was sent \nthrough energy recovery.\nWe utilize CHWMEG third-party audit reports to \nassess Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities \n(TSDF) across global sites. When CHWMEG audit \nreports are not available, we directly contract with \nthird-party firms to conduct audits of TSDFs. In \nFY2020, we conducted or reviewed 16 Hazardous \nWaste TSDF audit reports to ensure these facilities \nmeet the standards set by Seagate Corporate \nSustainability. A total of 9,455 metric tons of \nhazardous waste was transported to in-country TSDFs for treatment in FY2020. No waste was \nimported or exported during the year. The volume \nof waste transported is calculated from hazardous \nwaste consignment notes that accompany the \nshipment for treatment. \nAll of Seagate\u2019s waste numbers are off-site; our \nwaste contractor collects the waste, consolidates, \nand transports off-site to their own facilities for \nwaste processing.

We also aim to maintain a non-hazardous waste diversion rate of more than or equal to 87 \npercent in FY2021. Hazardous waste volume is a potential challenge, as we see it increasing due \nto process complexity at some of our sites; with site initiatives, innovation, and insights from our \nteams, we hope to keep our hazardous waste totals as low as possible and continue to decrease \nour hazardous waste per EB number.
