Other numbers in the table, for ethics, health and \nsafety, and our employees are all reported in FY. \n2  All 15 Scope 3 categories were assessed, and 12 of 15 were found relevant.  \n3 In FY2020, Ethical Conduct Policy and Conflict of Interest Policy Certification (Percentage) were broken out into two separate measurements, \nwhere previous years measured them together.

The criteria includes \npast engagement, collaboration with industry \nassociation e.g. the RBA, and publication of \nindustry reports, among other factors.  \nEach year, we solicit feedback from our \ncustomers and business partners to shape our \nGlobal Citizenship program plans and strategies. \nFor example, through a variety of surveys and \nreporting initiatives, Seagate shares detailed \ninformation about the company\u2019s environmental \nperformance and greenhouse gas emissions \nto help the electronics industry improve its \nenvironmental footprint. We also solicit feedback on Seagate\u2019s performance, reliability and product \nquality through Net Promoter Score and Customer \nScorecards on a quarterly basis. \nWe meet at minimum annually with investors, \ngovernments, nongovernmental organizations, \nlocal communities, and other civil society \nmembers to gather perspectives about trends \nin business and society that may influence not \nonly our business success, but also the extent to \nwhich we can contribute positively to sustainable \ndevelopment. We constantly engage with \nemployees, and for suppliers we have a dedicated \nsupplier day, webinars, training, and more. More \ndetail on these engagements can be found in our \nSupply Chain and Product Sustainability sections. \nA formal materiality assessment was completed \nin FY2020, and included speaking to both internal \nand external stakeholders to identify the material \ntopics to our business. \nFY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report117\n 116\nFY2020 Global Citizenship Annual Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STX_2020.pdf", "page": 58, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
