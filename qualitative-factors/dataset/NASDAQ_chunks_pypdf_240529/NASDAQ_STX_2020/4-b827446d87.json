{"page_content": "REPORT CONTENTS REPORT CONTENTSissues internal and external to Seagate. The third party \nwho conducted the assessment covered a wide  \nrange of issues to validate those which were of highest \nimportance to Seagate and our stakeholders, and those \nwhich were of lower priority. No aspect was intentionally \nexcluded from the scope of the assessment. Stakeholder \nfeedback gathered during the materiality assessment \nhelped to shape the content of this report. Seagate\u2019s \nmateriality assessment considered global citizenship \nimpacts both inside and outside the company, such \nas impacts to our customers, employees, global \npartners, and supply chain. These topics make up the \ncontent and structure of this report. The topics that we \nidentified as material to our business can be categorized \ninto governance and ethics, product security and data privacy, product stewardship, environmental \nsustainability, our employees, supplier engagement, \ncommunity engagement, and business continuity. \nWe review our materiality assessment annually, and \nafter reviewing our business operations in FY2020, we \nconcluded that we would conduct a new materiality \nassessment. This assessment reconfirmed the same \nmaterial topics and topic boundaries as our previous \nassessment from 2017, with the addition of product \nsecurity and data privacy. We will continue to review \nbusiness operations each year and conduct materiality \nassessments as needed. A breakout of material findings \nand their sub-topics can be found here, as well as \npolicies that drive our commitment and compliance.
