We have \nset short-term environmental goals relative \nto these efforts. As we move forward and \ncontinue our efforts to measure and manage \nthese environmental impacts, we will explore \nand evaluate new solutions for our operations.\nEnergy  \nGoal\nOpenText plans to reduce its energy  \nconsumption per dollar revenue by 5%  \nby June 30, 2023.5%Carbon  \nGoal 5%\nOpenText plans to reduce its scope 1 & 2 \ngreenhouse gas emissions per dollar  \nrevenue by 5% by June 30, 2023.Waste  \nGoal 65 %\nOpenText plans to work toward a goal of 65% \ndiversion rate in our regional headquarters \nby June 30, 2023.Julie Millard  \nVice President, Corporate Citizenship \n\u201cAs a global company, we recognize the tech \nindustry\u2019s environmental impact, and we \nembrace the responsibility of reducing our \nfootprint.
