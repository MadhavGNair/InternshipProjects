We continue to make progress toward our five- year goal of reducing total \nscope 1 and 2 emissions by  10 percent by CY2017 (using results from CY2011 as the baseline). In the area of \nscope 3 emissions, we will assess data that we added in previous years to determine other improvement opportunities.
