In 2021, we added two new  \ngender-diverse Board members. With these additions, \nour Board is 60% diverse (40% gender diverse and  \n30% ethnically diverse). The Board believes that  \ndiversity with respect to gender, ethnicity, background, \nprofessional experiences and perspectives is an  \nimportant element in the Board selection process.Shareholder Engagement Efforts\nTo effectively address the evolving expectations of our \nshareholder base and the broader investment community, \nwe remain focused on frequent and extensive shareholder \nengagement. Our outreach program generally targets \nshareholders representing approximately 70% to 75% of our \noutstanding shares, and we have generally held discussions \nwith shareholders representing well in excess of 60% of our \noutstanding shares. Key topics of discussion have included \nour corporate governance, sustainability and executive \ncompensation practices, as well as our business strategy and \nperformance and public disclosures. As a result of specific \nfeedback from shareholders, we have made numerous \nsubstantive changes to our compensation program, practices \nand disclosures, as well as to our governance practices.\nRecognition for Our Corporate  \nGovernance Program \nIn 2020, Corporate Secretary  magazine rated Atlas\u2019 legal \nteam as a finalist for best compliance and ethics program \n(small- to mid-cap), best proxy statement (small-cap), \nGovernance Team of the Year (small- to mid-cap) and \nGovernance Professional of the Year (small- to mid-cap).  \nThe company was also recognized by 2020 Women on  \nBoards, with a top rating of \u201cW\u201d for having 20% or more \nfemale Directors on our Board.
