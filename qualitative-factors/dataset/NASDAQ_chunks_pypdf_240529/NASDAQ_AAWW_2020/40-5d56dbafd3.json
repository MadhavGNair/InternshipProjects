When our teams at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky \nInternational Airport (CVG) identified unmet pandemic-\nrelated needs in their local community, they sprang into \naction, arranging for the delivery of 2,000 masks to  \nSt. Elizabeth Healthcare in Northern Kentucky. Days later, \nthey donated PPE to the flight crews of Aitheras Aviation \nGroup, the aviation partner of the Cleveland Clinic.Recognizing the pervasive impacts of the pandemic and \nresponding to the urgent request for help from a local food \nback, the team coordinated a donation to the Freestore \nFoodbank, which supports more than 500 community food \npantries. A long-time supporter of the organization matched \nthe gift, raising the combined donation to $20,000. The vital \nfunds helped the organization fulfill its mission to serve the \nneeds of those facing food insecurity, reaching an estimated \n270,000 people, including 80,000 children.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAWW_2020.pdf", "page": 40, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
