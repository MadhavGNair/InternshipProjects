We believe that safety and regulatory \ncompliance can be achieved through safety management, \nwith the implementation and continuous improvement of \nour formal Safety Management System (SMS).\nWe were among the aviation industry leaders that \nparticipated in the SMS Pilot Project in early 2010, prior \nto these standards being required by the U.S. Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA). We believe a formal \nSMS is critical for minimizing risks and maximizing \nopportunities to continually improve the overall safety \nof our global operations. As of January 2018, the \nFAA has accepted our fully implemented SMS, which \nincorporates four components: Safety Policy, Safety Risk \nManagement, Safety Assurance and Safety Promotion.\nAtlas\u2019 confidential, non-punitive, proactive hazard and \ncomprehensive reporting process encourages employees \nto report workplace safety issues or noncompliant \nconditions including hazards, accidents, incidents \nor injuries.
