{"page_content": "Achievements in 2018 Focus areas in 2019\nBusiness \nethics\u2022  All new employees have been introduced to Zealand\u2019s inter -\nnal rules as part of the introduction program.\n\u2022   No issues were reported under our whistle blower program.\n\u2022  Zealand concluded an investigation of current processes in rela-\ntion to the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \n\u2022  As part of the implementation of the GDPR Regulation, an as-\nsessment of more than 250 IT systems has been performed, \nand relevant policies and procedures have been updated.\u2022  Zealand will continue to have focus on Privacy \nregulation and the GDPR. \n\u2022  Zealand will continue to operate according to \nthe highest ethical standards.\n\u2022  Our code of business conduct is part of the \nintroduction program for all new employees. All \nemployees will be periodically reminded of its \nscope, and document that they are aware of it.Ethics\nWe strive to operate according to \nthe highest ethical standards, and \nsafeguard our business against \ncorruption and noncompliance.Business Ethics\nZealand\u2019s reputation as a trusted business and scien-\ntific partner are of the utmost importance. Therefore, \nour employees are trained and kept updated with \npolicies on good business practice and compliance, \ninsider trading, and appropriate legal management of \nthird party intellectual property. \nWe strive to operate according to the highest eth-\nical standards, and safeguard our business against \ncorruption and noncompliance where employees are \nmost at risk. Zealand will practively engage in a posi-\ntive dialogue with all regulatory and advisory author -\nities and with stakeholders from relevant industries in \norder to be inspired to make further imporvements.\nAs part of its program of maintaining a robust ethical \nworking environment, Zealand maintains a whistle-\nblower program that is monitored by an external law \nfirm to ensure that issues that need to be examined \nby senior management and members of the Board of \nDirectors are brought to their attention when appro-\npriate.\nWe actively promote and maintain a policy of trans-\nparency and honesty with our employees. Zealand\u2019s \nEmployee Handbook stipulates a set of policies that \nspecify the company\u2019s standards regarding its em-\nployees\u2019 general and legal conduct. Zealand has taken every precaution to keep all em-\nployees, board members and certain stakeholders \nup to date and compliant with our internal rules. We \ndistinguish carefully between those who are listed on \nits permanent insiders\u2019 list and those who are ex -\nposed to what is deemed insider information. In the \nlatter case, Zealand takes every precaution to keep an \nup-to-date list of employees\u2019 knowledge of insider \ninformation. All new employees are introduced to our \ninternal rules and have to sign a document stipulating \nthat they have read and understood these rules. \nWe have strict policies regarding the proper use and \ntransfer of intellectual property. Since it was founded, \nZealand has refined its confidentiality and material \ntransfer agreements to reflect critical changes in the \nindustry, building on the extensive industry experi-\nence of many of its senior members.\nRisk and mitigation\nThe main risks related to our activities include employ-\nees\u2019 and business partners\u2019 violation of our anti-corrup-\ntion commitment and potential legal and financial con-\nsequences thereof. Zealand\u2019s whistleblower program  \nand insider information list are two methods for mitigat-\ning such risk. We are developing programs to support  \nongoing maintenance of code of business conduct \nunderstanding among employees, as well as a more \nrobust program to ensure data privacy and protection.18\nZealand Pharma \u221e Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2018", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2018.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
