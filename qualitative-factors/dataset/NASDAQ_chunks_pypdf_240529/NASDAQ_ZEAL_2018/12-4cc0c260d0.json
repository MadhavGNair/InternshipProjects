{"page_content": "Quality\nZealand\u2019s quality policy \ndescribes compliance with \nrigorous internationally \nrecognized standards and \nguidelines at all stages of \nresearch and development, \nto ensure that we do not \nplace patients at risk due to \ninadequate safety, quality or \nefficacy. Zealand outsources GxP activities to qualified and \napproved vendors, where the sponsor responsibilities \nremain at Zealand. Oversight of the activities ensures \nvendor compliance with the requirements of phar -\nmaceutical quality standards as articulated in Good \nLaboratory Practice (GLP), Good Manufacturing \nPractice (GMP), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Good \nPharmacovigilance Practice (GVP), and others.\nWe work in close partnerships with vendors, and \nwhen evaluating these partners we focus both on \nbusiness ethics, i.e. human rights and reputation, as \nwell as capability and capacity of the service. Ele-\nments in the assessment include quality audits, sup-\nplier management assessment, and financial stability.Zealand\u2019s Pharmaceutical Quality System for devel-\nopment activities is described in our Quality Manual, \nwhich also defines our Quality Policy. Ongoing evalu-\nation of our quality system is performed continuously.\nRisk and mitigation\nOur reliance on external partners to perform GxP \nactivities poses risk that partners do not follow \nrequirements of pharmaceutical quality standards. \nSuch noncompliance would in turn jeopardize patient \nsafety, quality and efficacy of our medicines. Our \nvendor oversight program is intended to mitigate this \nrisk through thorough and ongoing assessment of all \nGxP vendors.\nAchievements in 2018 Focus areas in 2019\nQuality \nassurance \nand vendor \nmanagement\u2022  Zealand launched an NDA-readiness program to \nensure that required processes for commercial \noperations are in place before a \u00a739  inspection.\n\u2022  Zealand strengthened our quality team and final-\nized a new strong quality policy. \n\u2022  Zealand has an outsourced business model for \nGxP work and matured the vendor oversight pro-\ngram to cover all GxP vendors.  \n\u2022  As an integrated part of the Vendor Oversight \nProgram, Zealand successfully conducted 21 \nexternal audits.\u2022  Zealand will initiate the launch readiness pro-\ngram to ensure delivery to the market once \nregulatory approval is obtained.\n\u2022  Zealand will apply for a manufacturing authoriza-\ntion \u00a739 at the Danish Medicines Agency.\n\u2022  Zealand will continue to mature and continuous-\nly improve the Quality System required for late \nstage and commercial operations.\n\u2022  Zealand will continue oversight of outsourced \nactivities based on our quality risk management \nprinciples.\n3 \u00a739 inspection is conducted by the Danish Medicines Agency (DMA) in order to obtain a manufacturing authorization.13\nZealand Pharma \u221e Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2018", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ZEAL_2018.pdf", "page": 12, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
