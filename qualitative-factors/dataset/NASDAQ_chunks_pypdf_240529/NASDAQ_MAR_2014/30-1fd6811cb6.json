In this way, we can more accurately estimate energy consumption and \nGHG emissions for the entire managed portfolio (inclusive of all hotels operating for the \nentire year). To account for missing data in water consumption, we grossed up the actual withdrawal data by a ratio derived from total occupied rooms over occupied rooms with accurate data. Linking usage to the number of occupied rooms is the most relevant intensity \nmetric denominator for water use in the hotel industry.  MANAGEMENT APPROACH Continued\nAssociate and Guest Engagement\nWe provide standards and training for our associates on responsible operational \npractices and communicate regularly on environmental and conservation topics through our communications channels and social media . At each property, Energy \n& Environment Committees are also encouraged to engage one associate from each \ndepartment to form a cross-disciplinary team for the site\u2019s environmental pursuits  . \nOur corporate Environmental Policy is part of Marriott\u2019s Principles of Responsible \nBusiness, which we communicate internally and externally  .\nWe encourage our guests to be informed about our environmental efforts  . Marriott \nhas made available an online environmental sustainability dashboard, Green Hotels \nGlobal\n\u2122, to provide corporate customers with the environmental footprint, performance \nmetrics and practices for each hotel in our portfolio, including water and energy \nuse, emissions, recycling and over 100 property-level environmental practices  .  \nWe also offer a variety of additional options to engage guests including green meetings \nand EcoEvents\u00ae, which include linen-free tables to reduce laundry, products made \nfrom post-consumer waste, the ability to donate leftover event food, our Linen  \nand Terry Reuse program, electric vehicle charging stations and our new Meeting Services App  . The Ritz-Carlton\u2019s Give Back Getaway\n\u00ae program also offer leisure \nguests the opportunity to participate in half-day local social or environmental projects  . \nWe engage corporate customers and meeting planners through active participation in the Global Business Travel Association\u2019s Sustainability Committee and national conferences of meeting planners such as the Green Meetings Industry Council  .\n\u25cf\tWith our new, first-of-its-kind  \nRed CoatSM Direct Meeting App,  \nmeeting organizers can more easily \nhelp us save natural resources by \nadjusting and editing their meeting requests and preferences\n\u2014such as \nroom temperature \u2014with a touch of  \na button and without ever leaving the \nmeeting room  .
