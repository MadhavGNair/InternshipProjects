{"page_content": "INTRODUCTION \nResponsible management of natural resources in our hotel operations has been \na part of our business since we opened our first hotel in 1957  . As we grew over \nthe years, we established a formal program to reduce our water and energy \nuse . In 2007 we established our long-term environmental goals  .  \nMarriott International\u2019s environmental performance is a critical focus for our company  . With the rise in unpredictable weather patterns, stresses on natural \ncapital and resources, air and water quality issues, there is a rising tide of  \ncustomers, associates and external stakeholders who want to be informed about and engaged in our efforts  .\nOUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS\n1\n\u25cf\t\t\tFurther reduce energy and water consumption 20 percent by 20202 .\n\u25cf\t\t\tEmpower our hotel development partners to build green hotels  .\n\u25cf\t\t\tGreen our multibillion dollar supply chain .\n\u25cf\t\t\tEducate and inspire associates and guests to conserve and preserve  .\n\u25cf\t\t\t\tAddress environmental challenges through innovative conservation  \ninitiatives, including rainforest protection and water conservation .\nMANAGEMENT APPROACH \nOur commitment to the environment starts at the \ntop with our Global Green Council of ten Marriott\u00ae \nglobal officers and other senior executives, \nand extends enterprise-wide to our global \nfamily of associates and external partners  . \nSince 2007, the Council has evaluated our \npractices, set long-term goals, developed an \nenvironmental strategic plan and inspired our \nprogress  . The Council meets quarterly and reports \nprogress to Marriott\u2019s President and CEO, Arne Sorenson, who provides annual updates to the Board \nof Directors  .\nContinued\n2014 REPORT ON\nCHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES  AND PATH FORWARD\nGiven our growing portfolio of more  \nthan 4,000 managed and franchised  \nproperties around the world, Marriott\u2019s \noperations are dependent on the supply of fresh water, reliable energy, waste \nmanagement, recycling facilities and \nsustainable materials available within the markets and municipalities in which we \noperate  . As a result, we will continue to \nrefine and address the direct and indirect \nenvironmental impact of our hotels and \nwork with our stakeholders and external \npartners to develop innovative solutions to manage our business sustainably  .  \nThis is critical as we anticipate natural resources becoming more constrained and costly, and as local governments \nbegin to enact new carbon taxes and \nmore efficient building codes  . We are also \nincreasingly responding to and preparing \nfor natural events such as hurricanes, \nfloods and droughts  . \nIn the Americas, our largest distribution  \nof hotels, we also plan to focus on the expansion, integration and ongoing \nmonitoring of our building automation \nsystems  . Our commitment to build more \nsustainable hotels as well as reduce \nwaste, water and energy while inspiring \nothers to do the same is essential to our long-term business and community \nsustainability  .\n2014 MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\nTHE JW MARRIOTT DONGDAEMUN SQUARE \nSEOUL IS THE FIRST HOTEL IN THE CITY  \nTO RECEIVE LEED GOLD CERTIFICATION  .2013\n1   Our Responsible Sourcing and Natural Capital micro reports offer more detailed information  \non their respective goals.\n2  20 percent reduction from our 2007 energy intensity baseline of 401.2 kWh per square meter  of conditioned space and a water intensity baseline of 0.86 cubic meter per occupied room.\n26", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2014.pdf", "page": 26, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
