{"page_content": "STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND POLICY ADVOCACY   |  2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\nBANNING SHARK FIN THROUGH OUR  \nFUTURE FISH INITIATIVE \nHaving removed shark fin from our menus in late  \n2012, we reduced consumption by 80 percent in 2013  . \nEffective July 1, 2014, Marriott implemented a complete global ban on the sale of shark fin in our managed and franchised locations  . We believe the high-end, sustainable \ndining alternatives that our culinary team has developed,  \nwhich have contributed greatly to the reduction in  demand for shark fin dishes at our hotels to-date, will \ncontinue to be successful replacements for shark fin .   \nWe are encouraged that many global hotel brands are \nmoving in this direction .  \nAt the April 2014 World Travel & Tourism Council\u2019s Global Summit for Tourism in Hainan Province, China, Marriott\u2019s \nExecutive Vice President and Chief Global Communications \nand Public Affairs Officer Kathleen Matthews interviewed Yao Ming, the former basketball star, who returned  \nto Shanghai after retiring from professional basketball .  \nThe sports hero spoke passionately about his efforts  \nto improve China\u2019s rural schools and protect sharks,  \nelephants and rhinos, which are endangered due to China\u2019s exotic tastes  . Yao\u2019s courage to speak out against long-held \ncultural tastes has inspired companies like Marriott to \nban shark fin soup in our hotels and ensure that no ivory \nis sold in our gift shops  . The Chinese government\u2019s \nausterity measures have also been a factor in reduced \ndemand for shark fin dishes  .  \n STAKEHOLDERS FORMS OF ENGAGEMENT\nAssociates Global Engagement Survey, Marriott  \nGlobal Source (intranet), executive town hall  \nmeetings, social media, newsletters,  Business Councils, community projects, wellness programs, Legal and Ethical  Conduct Survey\nCustomers Guest Satisfaction Surveys, charitable  donations of loyalty program rewards points, cause marketing, industry working groups, sustainable guest room products, customer forums, research, social media\nCommunities Community engagement programs,  volunteering, fundraising and cash  contributions, in-kind donations,  disaster relief\nShareholders Annual Report, sustainability reporting,  carbon disclosure, quarterly earnings  releases and conference calls, annual  shareholder meetings, analyst meetings\nAssociations Board memberships, executive committees, working groups, advisors, research,  partnerships, workshops, lobbying\nSupply Chain Local supplier capacity building, supply chain screening, supplier diversity program, sustainable procurement surveys, engage-ment workshops, strategic partnerships\nOwners and  FranchiseesEconomic development, sustainable  hotel development\nNongovernmentalOrganizations (NGOs)Board memberships, executive committees,  \nworking groups, advocacy for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and  Degradation (REDD) projects, strategic partnerships on global issues\nGovernment Lobbying, advocacy, briefings,  meetings, pilot projects and research,  regulatory filingsAbove: Marriott announces its ban of the sale of shark fin \nduring an interview at the World Travel & Tourism Council \nConference in Hainan Province, China.
