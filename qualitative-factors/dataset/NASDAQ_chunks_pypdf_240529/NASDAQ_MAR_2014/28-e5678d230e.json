From \nindustry-leading demand response partnerships to capital expenditure (CAPEX) initiatives and a continual pipeline of return on investment projects such as lighting upgrades, building automations systems and combined heat and power plants, we are committed to making \nour properties as energy efficient as possible  . An increasing number of our properties have \ninstalled low-carbon or renewable energy systems such as geothermal, wind and solar  . \nWater \nMarriott assesses available resources for projects, including fresh water, in its feasibility \nstudies as hotels are being developed . Among operating hotels, heavy water users  \nimplement water conservation action plans to manage and reduce water usage  . \nMarriott also supports several natural capital projects, including the Nobility of Nature project in Sichuan Province, China, that helps to protect the source of fresh water for \nmore than 2 billion people, while encouraging water conservation in our China hotels  .\nIn pursuit of our water conservation goals, we have implemented a number of projects designed to enhance the efficient use of water at the hotels we manage  . \nThese include low-flow faucet and toilet fixtures, water sub-meters, more efficient laundry and dishwashing formulations and service, central plant upgrades, landscaping and irrigation, and golf course maintenance and operation  . Many of our properties \nhave greywater reuse or rainwater capture systems for irrigation  . When municipal \nwater supply is not available or sufficient, our hotel partners install water systems, including bore (water from underground aquifers), desalination and filtration  .2013 ACCOMPLISHMENTS Continued\n\u25cf\tTogether with energy supplier  Constellation Energy, an Exelon  \ncompany, Marriott has developed a \ndemand response (DR) program across the U  .S ., enrolling 167 properties  \nacross five regions  . During a one-year \nperiod, Marriott reduced its overall energy usage by 83  .5 MWh through \nparticipation in the DR program  . \n\u25cf\tOur owners invested $14  .5 million in \n232 energy-efficient mechanical-related \nCAPEX projects in our Americas full \nservice, select service and extended stay portfolio  . These projects include \nchillers, rooftop package units, hot water heaters and boilers and split systems  . \n\u25cf\tLED lighting retrofit projects were  a 2013 priority for our managed hotels \nin Asia Pacific and Middle East/Africa  \nto help reduce electricity demand and costs  . Lighting retrofits have been \npart of our environmental efforts  for years; as newer technology makes lighting more energy efficient, we \nupgrade systems at our properties \naround the world .\nWater\n\u25cf\tOur Caribbean and Latin America properties have numerous  \nwater-savings projects, including  \nsea water cooling, which eliminates fresh water and chemical needs, \nrepurposing treated guest room water, \nrecapturing rainwater for irrigation, reverse osmosis water treatment,  \nand condensate capture from property \nHVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) systems for reuse in \ncooling towers  .\n\u25cf\tMarriott established a standard for \nwater sub-meters and monthly \nsub-meter readings for cooling towers \nand irrigation at its managed, full service properties in the Americas  . \nThese meter readings will give a more detailed view of water consumption and aid in the early detection of leaks  . \nThe meters are currently installed in 143 of our Americas properties  .\n\u25cf\tWe installed water-flow controllers  \nat dozens of Marriott properties \nthroughout the Americas, Asia Pacific, \nMiddle East and North Africa hotels  .\n Continued\n*Numbers are based on 3,917 managed and franchised hotels in our system as of year-end 2013=\n1 year\u2019s energy savedTHROUGH OUR U  .S .
