Before speaking at the \nForum, Mr  . Sorenson commented in \nhis blog that \u201cthe U  .S . must do a \nbetter job welcoming international \nguests, who are traveling outside their \nhome countries in unprecedented numbers  . If the U  .S . had the same \nshare of global travel it had in 2000, the U  .S . would be welcoming roughly \n35 million visitors every year  . We \nestimate that would create one million more jobs in the U  .S .\u201d According to the \nWTTC, nearly 266 million jobs were \nsupported by Travel & Tourism in 2013, \nwhich is one out of 11 jobs worldwide  .\n  Our CEO and our government  affairs team meet regularly with \nadministration officials and the  \nU .S . Congress to promote the power  \nof tourism in furthering the country\u2019s continued economic recovery  .  \nIn early 2014, Marriott and the \nbroader travel industry celebrated \nrecord-high employment figures, \nsurpassing pre-recession levels  .  \nPart of this domestic growth was the \nresult of the Brand USA marketing \ncampaign, the first-ever national destination marketing program to sell \nthe United States abroad  . In 2013, \nBrand USA\u2019s overseas marketing \ncampaigns brought 1  .1 million new \ninternational visitors to the U  .S . who \nspent an estimated $3  .4 billion\n\u2014\nenough to support 53,000 domestic jobs . Marriott is currently advocating  \nfor Brand USA\u2019s reauthorization  \nby Congress before its scheduled expiration in 2015  .\n We also urged U  .S . legislators to  \npass the Jobs Originated through Launching Travel (JOLT) Act,  a bill to encourage international  \nvisitation by enhancing the Visa Waiver \nprogram and set standards to ensure rapid processing of tourist and \nbusiness visitor visa applications  \nat U .S . consular offices overseas  .  \u25cf\tAdvocating for Comprehensive  \nImmigration Reform \n As the U  .S . Congress considers  \nreforms to the U  .S . immigration  \nsystem, Marriott advocates for  \nmeasures that will provide more \nstability and certainty to immigrants, while ensuring we can fill critical  \nservice positions at our U  .S . hotels \nwhen we are not able to staff them \nwith Americans  .  \n We support reforms that would  \nresolve the status of the large  \nnumbers of undocumented  individuals currently in the United \nStates, permitting them to fully  \nparticipate in the economy, while  ensuring adequate future flows  \nof foreign workers to meet market  \nneeds  . We remain committed  \nto advocating for a uniform  \nfederal approach to immigration  \nenforcement that will supersede  a growing patchwork of state laws  .\n\u25cf\tCollaborating with the Industry  \nto Address Trafficking of Illegal  \nProducts and Services\n Marriott and Sabre Holdings  represented the tourism industry  \nat the launch of an anti-trafficking \ncampaign, Your Actions Count\n\u2014 \nBe a Responsible Traveller, at ITB \nBerlin, the world\u2019s largest tourism \ntrade fair  .\n Continued   \nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND POLICY ADVOCACY   |  2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n8", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2014.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
