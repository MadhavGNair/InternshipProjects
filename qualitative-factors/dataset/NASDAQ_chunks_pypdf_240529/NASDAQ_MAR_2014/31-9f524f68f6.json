To calculate energy and carbon emissions, the actual data (available for 85 of the portfolio) have \nbeen grossed up by a ratio derived from hotel rooms in the data set. In this way, we can more \naccurately estimate energy consumption and GHG emissions for the entire managed portfolio (inclusive of all hotels operating for the entire year). To account for missing data in water \nconsumption, we grossed up the actual withdrawal data by a ratio derived from total occupied \nrooms over occupied rooms with accurate data. Linking usage to the number of occupied rooms is the most relevant intensity metric denominator for water use in the hotel industry.\nMARRIOTT JOINS THE  \nTRIPADVISOR\u00ae GREENLEADERS\u2122 \nPROGRAM  \nNearly 50 percent of Marriott\u2019s  \nU .S . portfolio has earned TripAdvisor  \nGreenLeader\u2122 status  .
