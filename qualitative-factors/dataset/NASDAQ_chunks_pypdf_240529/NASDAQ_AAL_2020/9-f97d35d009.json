{"page_content": "Reducing Fuel Use per Seat  \nCumulative Improvements Since 2013, Percentage ChangeFleet Renewal\nAmerican\u2019s ongoing fleet renewal initiative, the most extensive in our \nindustry\u2019s history, is a key component of our climate change strategy. \nEach new generation of aircraft targets 15%-to-20% improvements in \nfuel efficiency, which yield meaningful reductions in GHG emissions. \nSince 2013, we have invested more than $24 billion in modernizing \nour fleet by taking delivery of 600 new aircraft.1 We retired a similar \nnumber over the same period, a process that we accelerated in 2020 \ndue to COVID-19 and the consequent decrease in demand. \nLargely as a result of flying these more efficient aircraft, we have \nimproved our fuel burn per available seat mile (ASM) by 8.5% \ncompared with 2013. (ASM measures an airline\u2019s passenger carrying \ncapacity, and it is calculated by multiplying the number of seats \navailable on an aircraft by the number of miles it will fly.) That adds \nup to 1.5 billion gallons of fuel saved and 14 million metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided. That is equivalent to the CO2 emissions \ngenerated by 3 million U.S. cars in one year. It would take 17 million \nacres of U.S. forests a year to absorb the same level of emissions.2\nBuilding a younger, more fuel-efficient mainline fleet\nAs of September 2021, American has the youngest mainline fleet \namong U.S. network carriers, at an average age of 11.6 years. Over the \nlast two years, we have retired five fleets (A330, B767, B757, MD-80 \nand E-190) that accounted for 43.9% of our capacity in 2013. New \nfleet type additions such as the Boeing 787, Boeing 737 MAX and \nthe Airbus 321neo, which incorporate the latest engine and airframe \ntechnologies, made up over 10% of our total ASMs in 2020 and are \nhelping contribute to the improved efficiency of our fleet. We will \ncontinue to induct these next-generation aircraft in the years to come. \nBased on gallons of fuel consumed per ASM, our mainline fleet fuel \nefficiency improved by 11.5% from 2013 through 2020.Transforming Our Mainline Fleet\n44% \nof our 2013 mainline  \nASMs have been  \nretired.\n1 Through June 30, 2021.\n2 Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator .\n1.5 B \ngallons of fuel saved\n14M \nmetric tons of CO2 emissions avoidedRetired fleet\n/gid00184/gid00140/gid00332/gid00184/gid00137/gid00332/gid00184/gid00134/gid00332/gid00131/gid00332\n/gid00133/gid00131/gid00133/gid00131 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00140 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00139 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00138 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00137 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00136 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00135 /gid00133/gid00131/gid00132/gid00134\"2014\" -2.5\n\"2015\" -3.6\n\"2016\" -4.6\n\"2017\" -5.7\n\"2018\" -5.7\n\"2019\" -4.9\n\"2020\" -8.5\n/gid00131\n/gid00133/gid00163/gid00136\n/gid00134/gid00163/gid00137\n/gid00135/gid00163/gid00137\n/gid00136/gid00163/gid00138 /gid00136/gid00163/gid00138/gid00135/gid00163/gid00140\n/gid00139/gid00163/gid00136/gid00004/gid00048/gid00040/gid00048/gid00039/gid00028/gid00047/gid00036/gid00049/gid00032/gid00001/gid00004/gid00035/gid00028/gid00041/gid00034/gid00032/gid00001/gid00036/gid00041/gid00001/gid00007/gid00048/gid00032/gid00039/gid00001/gid00003/gid00048/gid00045/gid00041/gid00001/gid00043/gid00032/gid00045/gid00001/gid00002/gid00020/gid00014\nAmerican Airlines 2020 ESG Performance Review\n9CEO Message Strategy Safety Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB Data Climate", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAL_2020.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
