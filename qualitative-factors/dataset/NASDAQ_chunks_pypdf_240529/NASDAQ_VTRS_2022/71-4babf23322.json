They serve several purposes, \nincluding:\n\u2022 Identifying risks to people, the environment and the \ncompany\n\u2022 Fostering continuous improvement\n\u2022 Promoting knowledge transfer\nViatris routinely conducts assessments and on-site audits, \nincluding reviews of our systems, procedures, programs \nand data. Every site has a one- to five-year auditing \nfrequency, with the actual schedule established per a \nrisk-based approach that incorporates EHS performance \ntrends, facility design, regulatory compliance and other EHS \nprogram requirements. Audited facilities with any identified \nobservations must develop and implement action plans \ntracked by the EHS function.\nRisk Management \nAt Viatris, we evaluate EHS risks for our products, processes \nand facilities. Per company policies, the Global EHS \nManagement System and technical requirements, each  \nsite must utilize EHS risk assessments using a formal  \nprocess to analyze EHS risks and maintain continuous \nimprovement plans.\nWe assess risks to our network on an ongoing basis and take \nmeasures to help ensure we can maintain a safe and stable \nsupply of medicines. As part of this, we evaluate regulatory \nand physical risks and opportunities associated with the \neffects of climate change across our operations.\nEnvironmental risk management plans include mitigating \nclimate change risks, including management of ozone-\ndepleting substances, refrigerants and GHG emissions  \nand improving water management and increasing  \nrecycling efforts. Through our Global EHS Management System, \nwe have implemented a new program and \ntechnical requirement regarding pharmaceuticals \nin the environment. Viatris conducts qualitative \nmanufacturing effluent risk assessments to \ndetermine the appropriate level of control \nmeasures needed for manufacturing to protect \nthe environment from releases of pharmaceutical \ningredients. \nMeanwhile, we are expanding our quantitative \nmanufacturing effluent risk assessments to \nother product classifications beyond previously \ncompleted antibiotic assessments. Viatris has \nestablished a prioritization scheme to help drive \nthe progression of these assessments from a high- \nto low-risk basis.Other environmental management areas of focus include:\n\u2022 Waste\n\u2022 Water scarcity (analyzed using the World Resources \nInstitute Aqueduct tool)\n\u2022 Wastewater treatment and discharge\n\u2022 Regulated air emissions\n\u2022 Physical risks such as those related to extreme weather \n\u2022 Pharmaceuticals in the environment, including \nantimicrobial resistance\nReporting \nMonitoring and tracking many elements of our \nenvironmental and safety performance enables us to \nmanage data, oversee results and identify risks and \nopportunities. \nOur IT systems include custom-built databases, tools, \ndashboards and reports that drive EHS compliance and \nhelp us identify key trends, opportunities and information. Acting on our commitment to transparency regarding \nour environmental efforts and performance, we report \nexternally on an annual basis and communicate with both \ninternal and external stakeholders throughout the year.\nExternal Certifications \nViatris applies a principled approach that each site seeks \nexternal certification on top of adherence to companywide \nmanagement systems and standards. We have received \nISO Environmental Management certifications at many \nof our sites, reflecting the strength of Viatris\u2019 own EHS \nmanagement system and standards.\nFor example, India hosts 13 manufacturing sites and 1 R&D \nfacility that hold ISO 14001:2015 Environment Management \nSystem certifications. It also has 6 API manufacturing sites \nthat we recertified to ISO 50001:2018 Energy Management \nSystem. Also, 13 of Viatris\u2019 India manufacturing sites were \nrecertified to ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health & Safety \nManagement System. \nEnvironmental Certifications\nExternal Certifications 2020 2021 2022\nNumber of sites certified \nto ISO 1400121 17 17\nNumber of sites certified \nto ISO 500018 7 7\n2020 data represents Legacy Mylan. 2021 and 2022 data represents Viatris.\nData as of February 2023.
