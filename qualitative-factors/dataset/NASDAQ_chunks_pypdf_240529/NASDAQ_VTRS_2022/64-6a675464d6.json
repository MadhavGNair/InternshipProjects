We also produce API for products in the \nfollowing areas: antibacterial; central nervous system agents; \nantihistamines/antiasthmatics; cardiovasculars; antivirals; \nantidiabetics; antifungals; and proton pump inhibitors.\nApproximately half of our API comes from India and China, \nand the other half originates from North America, Europe \nand Emerging Markets. In India, we have 151 manufacturing \nfacilities located in seven1 different states, which mitigates \nthe risk of disruption in any given part of the country.\n\u2022 Viatris\u2019 top 100 products are supplied by >200 locations \nfrom 35 countries. \n\u2022 Many products registered at multiple sites offer risk \nmitigation and flexibility to meet demand\n\u2022 ~50% of our top 100 products are dual sourced for API  \nand/or finished products\n\u2022 >110 locations in >20 countries supply API for our top \n100 products\nFor Europe, our finished dosage form facilities are supported \nby five different countries to mitigate risk of disruption. \nViatris\u2019 global supply chain is strategically designed to \nsupport our business and to protect the quality and safety \nof our diverse and increasingly complex products. We \nare continuously monitoring inventory levels of our raw \nmaterials and dosage forms. \nDesigned to reach more patients with more solutions \nwhen and where they need them, our regional supply \nsites are often in close proximity to our key markets and \nutilize demand and supply data to leverage capabilities and \ncreate efficiency and flexibility across our operations. We \nhave a Rapid Response Advanced Planning system, which \nis a state-of-the-art technology for supply chain planning \nand management. The program enables key stakeholders \nto be closely connected across our global operations.
