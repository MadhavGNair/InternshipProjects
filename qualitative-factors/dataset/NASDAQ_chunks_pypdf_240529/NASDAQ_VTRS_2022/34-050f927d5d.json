The objective of the program is \nto establish an EHS program at office locations which protect \nthe safety, health and welfare of our colleagues, visitors, \nvendors and others and seeks to reduce impacts on the \nenvironment. \nSome office locations have full-time EHS colleagues. For all \nother office locations, leadership appoints an office EHS \nLiaison to act as a conduit for department managers to fulfill \nthe program\u2019s expectations. Each office establishes an EHS \nCommittee, which may include representatives from office \nleadership, human resources, fleet and facility management \nand worker representatives. The EHS Committee meets \nregularly to facilitate the development and maintenance \nof the EHS program. Office colleagues are encouraged to \nexpress any concerns and ideas about safety through their \nlocal EHS Committee. They also receive training about how \nto report incidents or hazards to EHS for investigations and \ncorrective actions.   \nAdditionally, the program requires all building entrants, \nincluding visitors and contractors, to receive safety guidance \nregarding hazards and emergency procedures. \nDriver Safety Program\nAt Viatris, the safety of our field-based colleagues is a top \npriority. Many of these colleagues spend most of their day \ndriving to meet with customers, and we continue to expand \nour driver safety programs to keep the rules of the road and \nbest safety practices top of mind. \nIn Europe, China and Egypt, we partnered with a leading \nglobal provider of online driver safety training. Through \ntheir eDriving tool, our fleet drivers determine their driving \nrisk profile before being directed to targeted online training \ncontent to improve hazard awareness while driving. A \nsimilar program is also in use throughout our North America Implementing the Golden Rules Initiative    \nWhile we have companywide management systems and programs around EHS, truly instilling a culture of safety \nhinges on individual colleagues owning it and acting on it. Michael Houghton, Head of Site Operations at our facility \nin St. Albans, Vermont, and his colleagues are examples of that. The team did a dedicated assessment of the safety \nculture at the site, and the results were used to further develop and enhance their safety culture.\nIn 2022, the site\u2019s EHS Council expanded to include front-line employees in addition to people leaders and began to \nimplement the next phase in their program. The council determined that the site was ready to implement the next \nstep in enhancing the safety culture. They developed the Always Choose Safety slogan and the following five Golden \nRules:\n1. Always say something if you see something\n2. Always pause before acting to carefully assess the risk\n3. Always utilize the 3-foot rule around powered \nindustrial trucks4. Never work in a role beyond your training\n5. Never trade risk for time. Urgency is never a \nreason to work unsafely\nWhen the initiative first launched, colleagues at the site signed a \nbanner to show their commitment to Always Choose Safety and to \nfollow and promote the Golden Rules. The slogan and rules are now \nan integral part of meetings and are displayed in the main plant, \nwarehouse and the office building. The Golden Rules are reviewed \nduring Town Hall Meetings and are routinely discussed at monthly \npeople leader meetings. Safety messages from the monthly meetings \nare then cascaded down by the leaders throughout all departments. \nWith safety a regular part of communications at the facility, leaders have noted that colleagues are more \ncomfortable talking about safety. The banners serve as a reminder for colleagues to look for unsafe situations and \ntake action immediately. The banners also provide an opportunity to have an impromptu discussion with a colleague \nor small group of employees.\ncommercial organization. Both programs use the latest road safety technology, designed to help keep our commercial field-\nbased colleagues safe while driving.\nThe programs help sustain and build upon the crash-free philosophy that is at the heart of our road safety culture. They provide \ninteractive online training opportunities including topics such as defensive driving, distracted driving and parking lot safety. \nTrainings are assigned on a regular basis throughout the year to address any commonly occurring accidents and are also \nassigned to drivers as remedial training if they are involved in an accident.  \nIt\u2019s important that our commercial colleagues have access to relevant, leading-edge content to motivate and train them to be \nsafe, responsible drivers. We continue to evaluate other markets for expansion of our online driver safety programs. Helping our \ncolleagues avoid collisions, crashes, injuries or worse is critical to ensuring that everyone gets home to their family safely every day.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VTRS_2022.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
