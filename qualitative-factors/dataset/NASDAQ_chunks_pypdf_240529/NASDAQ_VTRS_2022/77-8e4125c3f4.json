Risk Governance and Management\nWe are committed to operating ethically and with integrity \nand seek to apply a holistic, enterprise-wide approach to risk \nmanagement. We are subject to a number of risks inherent \nin the complex and rapidly changing environment in which \nwe operate including, but not limited to, global operations, \nenvironmental and social matters. The company\u2019s \nmanagement and employees implement and administer \nrisk management processes to identify material risks to our \nbusiness. Management assesses, monitors and manages \nmaterial risks to our business, all while maintaining flexibility \nin how we operate. To further embed risk management \nand compliance into our culture, we implement policies and \nprocedures and train employees on how to comply with \nthem. \nManagement reports quarterly to the Viatris Board\u2019s Risk \nOversight Committee regarding enterprise risk, as well as \nother committees regarding risk-related matters within the \nscope of their oversight responsibilities. Global Internal Audit \nand Global Compliance report into the audit and compliance \ncommittees of the Viatris Board, respectively.\nThe company\u2019s enterprise risk management (ERM) and \nbusiness crisis management processes and associated \nprograms are supported by multiple functional areas, \nincluding, among others, Global Internal Audit, Global \nInformation Technology, Global Information Security, Global \nCompliance, CSR, Global EHS, Global Security, Finance, \nLegal, Quality and Product Safety. Other stakeholders \nsupport the company\u2019s ERM activities as needed. These \nprograms are designed to support the business and ensure \nthe company is prepared to respond to a variety of events \nthat may adversely impact it, such as unrest/conflicts, legal \nor regulatory matters, supply disruptions, pandemics and \nenvironmental events (including those related to climate \nchange). \nBy embedding our ERM program into the company\u2019s \nstrategic planning process, we seek to optimize our ability to \nidentify risks, while identifying and leveraging opportunities. Placeholder: How Viatris Considers Price as \nPart of Our Commitment to AccessibilityHow Viatris Considers Price as Part of \nOur Commitment to Access   \nAt Viatris, we provide an exceptionally broad \nand diverse portfolio for patients across a broad \nrange of major therapeutic areas, spanning both \nnoncommunicable and infectious diseases.  Our \nglobal portfolio includes best-in-class, iconic brand-\nname products as well as global key brands and \ngenerics, including branded and complex generics. \nMany of the medicines in our portfolio are not \nprotected by patents and therefore are subject to a \ngeneral trend of price deflation over time.\nAs we participate in tender programs or public \nprivate partnerships around the globe, we evaluate \nthe price of the generics within our portfolio \nbased on an assessment of patients\u2019 need, supply, \ndemand, the cost of manufacturing and the \naffordability of our products, especially as it relates \nto the equivalent brand name drug, among other \ndeterminants. Other factors considered when \npricing our branded portfolio include their value to \npatients and providers as well as current economic \nindicators.\nWorking to ensure that patients across all income \nlevels have access to the medicines we offer means \nwe must carefully evaluate the socioeconomic \nconditions within each market where Viatris does \nbusiness while simultaneously sustaining our ability \nto consistently provide patients with a reliable \nsupply of the quality products they need. We work \nto provide holistic solutions for governments, \nNGOs and health systems globally, as we partner to \nconnect more people to products and services.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_VTRS_2022.pdf", "page": 77, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
