{"page_content": "5\n2022 Viatris Sustainability Report\ufffdntroduction Access and Global Health Our People Environment Community Management Disclosure and Data Appendix GR\ufffd, SASB and TCFD\nSince first joining the company \nas a member of the Viatris Board \nin December 2022 and now as \nCEO since April 1, I have seen \nfirsthand the incredible passion \nand engagement that everyone \nthroughout Viatris has for our \nmission to empower people \nworldwide to live healthier at every \nstage of life. This passion is one of \nthe many things that attracted me to the company and that \nexcites me about the work we are doing to deliver high-\nquality medicines and health solutions at scale to people \naround the globe, regardless of geography or circumstance. \nI continue to be thoroughly impressed by all that has been \naccomplished since the company was launched just over two \nyears ago and by the well-crafted strategic plan laid out for \nViatris\u2019 future. As a company uniquely positioned to bridge \nbetween the significantly broad access of generics and \nbrands, we combine the best of both, to address healthcare \nneeds more holistically around the world. And while Viatris \nhas already had many successes, we are constantly looking \nfor ways to do even more to deliver on our mission. \nWith an exceptionally extensive and diverse portfolio of \nmedicines to meet nearly every health need, a one-of-a-kind \nglobal supply chain designed to reach more people with \nhealth solutions when and where they need them, and the \nscientific expertise to address some of the world\u2019s most \nenduring healthcare challenges, the pursuit of broad access  \ntakes on deep meaning at Viatris. With our ability to touch \nall of life\u2019s moments, we put access into action every day \nAs we continue to build upon \nour strong foundation as a \ntrue champion for access to \nmedicine, the Board of Directors \nand I are extremely pleased to \nwelcome Scott A. Smith as our \nnew CEO to guide Viatris as it \nmoves forward. Scott brings \ndeep industry knowledge and \na forward-looking business \nmindset to our company. Most importantly, I have seen \nfirsthand Scott\u2019s appreciation for our mission. I expect \nhim to further reinforce our role as a reliable supplier of \naccess to high quality, more affordable medications to our \npartners and patients around the world for many years to \ncome, as we continue to build access at scale while also \nwhile delivering long-term value to all of our stakeholders. \nOur second full year as Viatris continued to mark \nsignificant milestones for our company, as we worked to \ncomplete the integration of our legacy companies and \ncompleted the divestiture of our biologics business. We \nalso added another significant franchise to our platform \nthrough the acquisitions of Oyster Point Pharma and Famy \nLife Sciences, creating the Viatris Eye Care division and an \neven stronger foundation for the company as we enter \ninto Phase 2 of our strategic plan.\nOn behalf of the entire Board, I want to express our \nextreme gratitude for Viatris\u2019 passionate, intelligent \nworkforce, all of whom continue to achieve new heights \nthrough their tireless efforts to deliver on our mission of \naccess.  \nI\u2019ve never been more excited or more confident about the \nfuture of Viatris, its employees and all of its stakeholders \nthan I am today.as we focus on striving to meet individual needs, whether \nwith a generic medicine, an improved version of an existing \nmedicine, or a truly novel therapeutic solution. \nThroughout 2022, colleagues across the company worked \ndiligently to integrate our legacy companies, to deliver \non the priorities of Phase 1 of our strategic plan and to \nadvance commitments and performance in areas especially \nimportant to Viatris\u2019 work in sustainability.  Highlights \ninclude: \n\u2022 Actions and progress related to Viatris\u2019 initial \nsustainability goals that were announced in 2022 in the \nareas of access and global health; diversity, equity and \ninclusion and the environment. \n\u2022 Our targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were \nvalidated and approved by the Science Based Target \ninitiative in 2022, marking a significant achievement \nand testament to our commitment to address climate \nchange and protect a reliable supply of medicines. \nAs a signatory to the UN Global Compact, we believe that \ncompanies can play a relevant role in serving as a positive \nforce to help address some of society\u2019s greatest challenges. \nLooking to the future, we will focus on Phase 2 of Viatris\u2019 \nstrategic plan, continuing to move up the value chain and \nlook for opportunities to provide even more medicines and \nhealthcare solutions that meet unmet patient needs. It is  \nan exciting time to be at Viatris, and I am honored to lead \nthis team and this company in the continued pursuit of our \nbold mission.\n\u2014 Scott A.
