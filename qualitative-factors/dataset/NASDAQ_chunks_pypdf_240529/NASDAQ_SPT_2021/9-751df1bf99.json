We\u2019re addressing these challenges by \ncontinuing to build on and invest in equitable systems around promotion, internal advancement \nand hiring. Our work with DEI is not bound by reaching numerical goals for representation, which \ncan assume this work ends once the goal is reached. Rather, we also assess other measures \nof employee engagement, such as attrition rates and qualitative feedback, to view the data \nholistically. By analyzing these movements within that context, we are able to better understand \nhow Sprout can continue to be a career accelerator both within and beyond our organization.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SPT_2021.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
