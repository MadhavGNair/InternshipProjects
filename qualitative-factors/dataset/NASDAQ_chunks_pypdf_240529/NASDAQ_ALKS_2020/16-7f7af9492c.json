The facility was designed \nwith a focus on efficiency and occupant well-being. \nEfficiency\nThe building is designed to consume nearly 30% \nless energy than baseline government standards. \nDesign elements incorporated to achieve this \nefficiency include:\n\u2022 Energy-efficient air handling units, chillers, and \nhood and exhaust turn-downs\n\u2022 Condensing hot water modular boilers\n\u2022 A Konvekta energy recovery system that \nprovides variable flow energy recovery between \nthe supply and exhaust air-streams, with coils \nmanufactured specifically for efficiency and turn-\ndown\n\u2022 High-efficiency LED lightingOccupant Well-Being\n\u2022 Building design that promotes activity, including \nfitness center, outdoor activity spaces such as \nwalking paths, and active workstations.  \n\u2022 Interior workstation environments that have daylight \nexposure and enhanced air quality \n\u2022 Dedicated spaces for new mothers, health and \nwellness\nSustainability Through Design\nReducing our carbon footprint and ensuring that \nAlkermes\u2019 buildings and processes operate sustainably \nare major factors in the planning and decision-making \nprocesses for all new construction at our facilities. In \naddition, for our existing infrastructure, our monitoring \nand targeting systems enable us to identify \nopportunities for further energy reduction or other \nsustainability improvements. \nExamples of our sustainability design efforts include:\n\u2022  Installation of energy-saving fixtures such as low \nemissivity windows, LED lighting with motion \nsensors, and reflective roofing;\u2022  Upgrade of HVAC systems to be more efficient  \nand require lower energy consumption; \n\u2022  Installation of variable speed drives and high- \nefficiency motors;\n\u2022  Institution of water conservation measures such as \nprocess cleaning optimization and low-flow restroom \nfixtures; and\n\u2022  Installation of sensors at fume hoods to reduce \nexhaust flow during unoccupied times.\nFrom these initiatives, we have realized significant \nreductions in energy demand and carbon emissions,  \nas illustrated in the charts on page 17, including a \nreduction in energy use per employee of 42% in the \npast five years.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALKS_2020.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
