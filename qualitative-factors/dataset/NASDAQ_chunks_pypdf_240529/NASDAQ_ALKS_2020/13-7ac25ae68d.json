We implement this \ncommitment by integrating EHSS risk management \nrequirements throughout the lifecycle of each of \nour products. Our approach to product stewardship \noversight and control includes:\n\u2022  Generation of occupational and environmental \ntoxicology data, which is iterated and augmented  \nas each product progresses through its lifecycle;\n\u2022  Development and application of appropriate \noccupational health, safety, and environmental risk \ncontrols for each product based on scale, potency, \ntask, and other processing considerations; \n\u2022  Protocols and risk assessments to support safe and \nresponsible technology transfers within Alkermes \nor to external contract manufacturing organizations \n(CMOs), or contract research organizations (CROs) \nor other third parties;\n\u2022  Development of \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d processes \nto eliminate or reduce the use or generation of \nhazardous substances in the design and manufacture \nof our products; and \n\u2022  Implementation of a global program for process \nhazard management, with embedded controls as \nearly as discovery and through full commercial-scale \nmanufacturing.External Operations Risk Management \nWe have integrated certain EHSS risk management \nprocedures and the formal RMS framework into our \nvendor management and governance processes, and \nwe collaborate directly with strategic partners to  \nfoster effective two-way risk management-focused \ncommunications. To ensure that our vendors operate  \nto Alkermes\u2019 standards, EHSS risk considerations are \nembedded into our due diligence assessments,  \non-boarding procedures, technology transfers and \nroutine business reviews. We also incorporate \nenhanced EHSS provisions, as appropriate into our \nstandard service-level agreements related to our \nproducts.\nOur vendor assessment tools, which we developed \nbased on the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative\u2019s \n\u2018Pharmaceutical Industry Principles for Responsible \nSupply Chain Management,\u2019 address key areas such  \nas: EHSS management systems; performance and \nregulatory compliance; environmental sustainability; \noccupational health and safety systems; process safety \nmanagement controls; physical security; labor and \nethics policies; business continuity systems; and \ncapability to safely handle Alkermes products.\nWe have conducted on-site audits or tabletop reviews \nto assess all external CMOs directly involved in the \nmanufacture or packaging of proprietary Alkermes \nmedicines, and use the information gained from these \nassessments to help us prioritize areas of focus for our \nongoing risk management efforts.
