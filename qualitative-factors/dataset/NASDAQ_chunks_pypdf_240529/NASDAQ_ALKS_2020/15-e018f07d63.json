Our waste \nstreams are fully segregated, and disposal methods  \nare carefully evaluated to ensure compliance with \nstatutory and permit requirements.\nFor non-hazardous waste, our goal is to eliminate \nlandfilling wherever feasible, and we actively \nimplement recycling, composting and/or other  \nre-use opportunities. We also employ other forms  \nof responsible disposal, such as treatment in third-\nparty \u201cwaste-to-energy\u201d facilities. \nSimilarly, for hazardous waste, we recognize that \nlandfill is not an environmentally responsible disposal \nroute. We actively explore recycling opportunities for \nour hazardous wastes and, when feasible, select disposal \nroutes that include potential energy recovery benefits. \nIn 2019, we initiated a project to streamline waste \nmanagement at our U.S. facilities, including replacing \nour multiple existing waste management contracts \nwith one integrated waste management contract, in \nhopes of better positioning the Company to identify \nand implement new opportunities for responsible \nwaste disposal and further reduction of waste \nmaterials. We expect this project to yield initial results \nstarting later in 2020.\nCase Study: Optimizing Waste Recycling \nin our Wilmington Facility\nIn 2019, a cross-functional team evaluated \nopportunities to increase recycling in our \nWilmington, Ohio manufacturing facility. The team \nidentified additional opportunities to recycle a \nvariety of materials, including glass vials and \nchemical bottles, plastic from manufacturing areas, \nand scrap metal. These additional recycling activities \nresulted in an increase of nearly 13 metric tons to the \nfacility\u2019s aggregate recyclable material as compared \nto 2018.\nRecycled*\nWaste-to-energy**\nIncineration  \n(no heat recovery)\nLandfillALKERMES WASTE PROFILE 2019 (TOTAL WASTE)\n* \u201c Recycled\u201d: A waste that is used, reused or reclaimed  \n(based on SASB RT0101)\n** \u201cWaste-to-energy\u201d: A method of converting non-recyclable waste into \nuseable forms of energy including heat and electricityThe following chart illustrates how our waste streams \nwere disposed of in 2019 (figures are for total \nenterprise waste, combining both non-hazardous and \nhazardous waste stream data).
