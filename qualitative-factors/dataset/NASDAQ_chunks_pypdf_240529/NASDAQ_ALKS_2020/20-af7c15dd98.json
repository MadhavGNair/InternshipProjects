{"page_content": " 20\nALKERMES \u2022 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT\nOUR TEAM TAKES SERIOUS MENTAL \nILLNESS AND ADDICTION \nPERSONALLY\n\u201cEveryday when I get up and go to work whether \nit\u2019s on the road or in the home office, the \nmotivation behind what I do is nothing short of \nhaving an impact on anybody struggling with \naddiction. My dad is always on my mind as part of \nthat passion and push for my daily work and job, \nand not in a negative way. One of the things I \nlearned from the journey my dad was on is that it \ntakes a village for someone to really find their path \nback to recovery and everybody that\u2019s helping is \nalso helped through the process. When someone \nasks me years from now, \u2018What did I do for work?\u2019 I \nwill tell them I spent my days doing my part each \nand every day to help people struggling with \nopiate and alcohol addiction.\u201d \n- Regional Director at Alkermes\n \u201cAs a child, I lost my brother to cancer. My mother, \na retired chemistry teacher, demonstrated amazing \nstrength during my brother\u2019s battle with cancer \nand instilled within me a sense of scientific \ncuriosity that motivates me to research new cancer \ntreatments.\u201d \n\u2013 Oncology Director at Alkermes\n\u201cMy uncle has schizophrenia. He was a genius, \nvaledictorian at Boston Latin, he was published at \na young age in scientific journals, but he became a \nvagrant and ended up wandering around the US. \nIt\u2019s a lot of lost time. His struggle, and my family\u2019s \nstruggle, motivates me to do the best I can, to \naffect the products we bring to the market. We can \npositively impact someone else\u2019s life, a family who \nis going through something similar. I can\u2019t change \nthe past, but certainly we can provide medication \nand get it into the hands of the people who need \nit.\u201d\n\u2013 Quality team member at AlkermesSocial Impact\nWe recognize that all of our stakeholders are \nconnected in a single environment and affect one \nanother.
