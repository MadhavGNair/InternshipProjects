In 2011, \ntotal employment costs decreased by 3.8%; this was due mainly to an overall decrease in the size of AEGON\u2019s workforce. During the \nyear, AEGON introduced a new Global Remuneration Framework. This framework sets out basic standards for salaries and incentive \npayments, ensures that incentives are linked directly to the company\u2019s strategic objectives and that salary structures do not lead to \nexcessive risk-taking or compromise the independence of those working in \u201ccontrol functions\u201d, such as internal audit or compliance. \nThe Global Remuneration Framework applies to all AEGON employees worldwide. \nEMPLOYMENT COSTS\nEmployment costs per capita rose in 2011 across AEGON\u2019s main operating units. This was due to currency factors and restructuring \nin many businesses in the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. \n \nPERFORMANCE-RELATED PAY\nAt AEGON, employees\u2019 salaries may contain both a fixed and variable component. This variable component is linked to either company \nor personal performance, or both. Generally, the proportion of this variable pay increases with seniority. \nPENSION ARRANGEMENTS\nPension arrangements vary by country unit. In the United States, which accounts for 45% of AEGON\u2019s worldwide workforce, \nemployees are offered both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. In total, AEGON\u2019s pension plans in its three main markets \n\u2013 the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom \u2013 cover an estimated 55,000 current and former employees. \nEXECUTIVE BOARD REMUNERATION\nFor full details of AEGON's approach to executive pay, please see pages 115 to 121 and pages 303 to 306 of AEGON\u2019s 2011 Annual Report, \navailable at www.aegon.com .", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2011.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
