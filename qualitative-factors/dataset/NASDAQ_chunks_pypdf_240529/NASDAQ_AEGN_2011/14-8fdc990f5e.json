Throughout recent economic turmoil, AEGON has been able to maintain strong insurance financial strength ratings \nfor its main operating units in the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

These include signed contracts and agreed codes of behavior and ethics. In some businesses, AEGON has advisory councils \nor committees that oversee the implementation of minimum standards for brokers, agents and other intermediaries. \nMARKET CONDUCT PRINCIPLES\nIn addition to local systems, AEGON has also introduced market conduct principles \u2013 a set of ground rules that help ensure open, \nfair and honest treatment of the company\u2019s customers. The principles are based, in part, on a number of existing initiatives, including \nthe \u201cTreating Customers Fairly\u201d initiative in the United Kingdom and the principles issued by the Insurance Marketplace Standards \nAssociation in the United States. AEGON\u2019s new market conduct principles will be rolled out gradually to businesses worldwide over \nthe coming months. The principles are aimed at ensuring AEGON provides effective products, with clear, easy-to-understand \ninformation and advice, and that products and services are fully tailored to the needs of the customer. \nSUPPLY CHAIN\nAs a provider of long-term financial products, AEGON has relatively few social, environmental or economic risks associated with its \nsupply chain. Primary responsibility for supply chain management rests with AEGON\u2019s country and operating units. Many of these \nunits apply locally-determined standards when selecting suppliers.
