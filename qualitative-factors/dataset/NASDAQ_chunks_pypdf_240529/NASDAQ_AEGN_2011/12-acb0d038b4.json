The survey was sent to all employees worldwide. A total \nof 78% responded. As part of the survey, AEGON measured both engagement (the degree of employee commitment to the company) \nand empowerment (the extent to which employees feel able to carry out their work effectively). AEGON will use results from the \nsurvey to address specific areas at local and company levels where improvement is needed. Results were benchmarked against both \nindustry averages and highest performers from outside the financial sector. AEGON plans a second survey in early 2013. Prior to 2011, \nemployee satisfaction and engagement surveys were carried out at a local level only. \nEMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION\nDuring 2011, works councils or other employee representative bodies met regularly in the following countries: United Kingdom, \nthe Netherlands, Hungary, Poland and China.
