This year the use phase models have been \nenhanced, taking into account real use pattern data. Several additional components are \nnow modelled with primary data from Apple\u2019s suppliers. \nFor all product LCA calculations, where exact data was missing, the principle of a worst-\ncase approach has been followed and results have been calculated with rather conservative \nestimates regarding e.g. production yield losses and recycling.   \nThe review has not found assumptions or calculation errors on the CCF data level that \nindicate the scope 3 corporate carbon footprint has been materially misstated. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.    \n \nBerlin, March 24, 2016 \n  \n- Karsten Schischke -  - Marina Proske - \nFraunhofer IZM  Fraunhofer IZM \nDept.
