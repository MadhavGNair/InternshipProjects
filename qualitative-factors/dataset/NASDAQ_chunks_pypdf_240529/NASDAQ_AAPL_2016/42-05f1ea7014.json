The overall plausibility check addressed the following questions: \n\uf0a7 Are product LCAs referenced correctly? \n\uf0a7 Are results for products, for which no full LCA review was undertaken, plausible? \n\uf0a7 Are carbon emission data for individual products plausible in the light of \nmethodological changes as indicated by Apple?  \nThis review was done remotely. \n \n3 Findings \nPrior to this CCF review and verification 14 recent product LCA studies, including for the first time separately sold accessories, have been reviewed successfully against ISO 14040/44. These recent LCAs cover most important product segments (Apple Watch, iPad, \niPhone, iPod, MacBook, MacBook Pro, and Beats products). These latest LCA studies cover \nproducts which represent in total 47,2% of the total scope 3 company carbon footprint. \nRepresentatives of other product segments (iMac, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, Airport Express / \n43", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
