{"page_content": "23\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2016 Progress Report, Covering FY2015The five-year WWF pilot project aims to transition up to 1 million acres of forest, across \nfive southern provinces, into responsible management by 2020.10 WWF\u2019s work has three \nprimary components:\n1.  Incr ease responsible management of working forests in China\u2014by creating up to \n300,000 acres of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\u2013certified forests, and up to 700,000 acres of forests under improved management.\n2. Improve China\u2019s policy framework to encourage responsible forest management. \n3. Establish long-term market incentives in China for responsibly sourced paper. Since launching the project in 2015, WWF has signed up forestry companies that are \ncommitted to certifying nearly 150,000 acres to the FSC standard and an additional \n190,000 acres under improved management. Once certified, these forests will make a major contribution toward Apple\u2019s goal of protecting and creating enough responsibly \nmanaged forests around the world to cover all our packaging needs. If successful, this \nproject can shift the dynamics of the world\u2019s paper market in both the short and long term, and in the process protect some of the world\u2019s most important forests.\nProduct Design\nA durable device is a greener device.\nWhen products can be used longer, fewer resources need to be extracted from the  earth to make new ones. So we assess all our products in our Reliability Testing Lab, \nusing custom, comprehensive measures. And we release regular software updates  \nthat keep our products current and reduce how often they need to be replaced. \nTo ensure that it can stand up to repeated \nuse, the MacBook keyboard is tested with millions of clicks.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
