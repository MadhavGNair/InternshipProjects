{"page_content": "7\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2016 Progress Report, Covering FY2015The transition to renewable energy can be highly technical. It often requires compli -\ncated deal structures across many regions with their own regulatory requirements. \nApple is experienced in sourcing and building renewable energy\u2014quickly and at a \nhigh standard across the globe\u2014so we are working with our suppliers to help them overcome challenges. We know that, with some hard work and collaboration, suppliers \ncan reduce their own carbon footprint through the development of high-quality and \ncost-effective renewable energy projects. As part of Apple\u2019s industry-leading program, over the next two years, Foxconn will install 400 megawatts of solar to cover the  \nenergy use of its iPhone final production facility in Zhengzhou, China.\nLowering our carbon emissions by focusing \non aluminum.\nWe sell millions and millions of phones. So making even small adjustments to the  \nproduction of iPhone can have a big impact. We discovered that changing how  \nwe make the aluminum enclosure could lower our carbon footprint. We prioritized  \naluminum that was smelted using hydroelectricity rather than fossil fuels. And we \nreengineered our manufacturing process to reincorporate the scrap aluminum. As  \na result, we cut the carbon footprint associated with the aluminum enclosure of \niPhone 6s in half compared with the previous generation. And we\u2019re looking for new ways to use more carbon-efficient aluminum across all of our products.\niPhone 6\niPhone 6s\nThe carbon footprint of iPhone 6s  \naluminum enclosure is half that of  the previous generation.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
