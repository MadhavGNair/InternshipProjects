You, our workers, \nand the planet. \nFor years, we\u2019ve led the electronics industry in removing toxins from devices. This past \nyear, we started a Full Material Disclosure program, which will show us the chemical \ncomposition of every material in every component of our products. It also makes us \neven better at reducing or removing toxins. And once we figure out how to remove a toxin from a device or a manufacturing process, we use extensive testing to make sure \nit stays out.\nWe\u2019ve analyzed over 10,000 parts. And that\u2019s \njust the beginning.\nOur Full Material Disclosure program seeks to identify all the substances we use in all \nthe parts we use. We\u2019ve already looked at more than 10,000 individual components, \nand we get data on more parts every day. We assess the different chemicals in those \ncomponents using 18 different criteria. This helps us understand their effect on our health and on the environment. If we do find an unacceptable risk, we then seek  \nalternatives or ban the substance altogether.  \nWe start this process early in the design and manufacturing phases so we can take appropriate actions to remove or replace hazardous chemicals. In some cases, few \nreplacements are readily available so we work with our suppliers to find substitutions\u2014\nor switch to another supplier that uses safer materials. If there is no replacement for  the substance, we work with our design teams to explore how to eliminate the need \nfor that substance.
