We even include the energy it \ntakes to charge your device, which usually comes from carbon-intensive sources such \nas coal or gas. So we\u2019re always developing new ways to make our products as efficient as possible. For example, the Mac operating system puts the hard drive to sleep and \nruns processors in an ultralow power mode when you\u2019re not hard at work. It can even \nsave energy when the screen is static and  between keystrokes when you type.\nMacBook Air consumes 52 percent less energy than the original model. Mac mini \nconsumes 40 percent less power when idle than the previous generation. Apple TV \nconsumes 90 percent less energy than the first generation. And you can charge your \niPhone 6s once a day for a year for only 53 cents.3 In fact, since 2008 we\u2019ve reduced \nthe average total power consumed by Apple products by 64 percent, bringing down \nour overall carbon footprint and your electricity bill at the same time.4\n0.5 w \nPower consumed by the MacBook in \nsleep mode, the lowest of any Mac.\n7x\nMac mini exceeds ENERGY STAR  \nrequirements by up to seven times.\n97%\nThe power used by the iMac in sleep mode was reduced 97 percent compared with the  \nfirst-generation iMac. \nT\nhe cost to charge the battery of an \niPhone\n \n6s once a day in the United States  \nis 53\u00a2 per year.3\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
