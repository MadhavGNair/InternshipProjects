The scope of the Fiber Footprint includes Apple\u2019s co rporate fiber usage from products. Facility fiber usage is explicitly \nexcluded. The fiber footprint tracks the total amount of wood fiber, both virgin and \nrecycled, that Apple uses in packaging, and other paper products. Apple obtains and \nanalyses supplier-specific data for each pr oduct line and sums up these figures for the \nentire company using sell-in numbers. The output is a total fiber footprint.  \nThe review of the corporate annual fiber footprint has considered the following criteria: \n\uf0a7The system boundaries are clearly defined \n\uf0a7Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate \n\uf0a7Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately \ndisclosed \nData reported by Apple is as follows: \n Total Fiber Virgin Fiber Recycled Fiber \n2015\u00a0 132,741 51,669 81,072\u00a0\n[metric tons fiber] [metric tons fiber] [metric tons fiber] \n \nAll results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2015 are plausible. \n45", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
