Due to its proximity to one of Denmark\u2019s largest \nelectrical substations, the data center won\u2019t require any back-up generators, which \ntypically run on diesel and require periodic testing and burning of fuel. The facility is designed to capture excess heat from its equipment and conduct it into the local  \ndistrict heating system to help warm homes in the community. Denmark has a long \ntradition of biomass energy generation from agricultural waste products.\nOur colocated facilities \nThe vast majority of our online services are provided by our own data centers; however, we also use third-party colocation facilities for additional data center capacity. While \nwe don\u2019t own these shared facilities and use only a portion of their total capacity, we \ninclude our portion of their energy use in our renewable energy goals. Over 85 percent of our power for colocated facilities is matched with renewable energy generated \nwithin the same state for facilities in the United States, or within the same country for \nthose around the world. And we will keep working with collocated suppliers to get to 100 percent around the world, including in regions where renewable energy markets \nare underdeveloped. \nFurthermore, we worked with one of our main suppliers of colocated services to help \nit develop the capability to provide renewable energy solutions to its customers. This \npartnership serves to advance the renewable energy program of both Apple and those \nof other companies that use this colocation provider.\nBeyond the use of our own data centers and colocated facilities, we also use third- \nparty computing services  to support  some of our on-demand  cloud storage-based  \nservices. We encourage and work with these suppliers to adopt a 100 percent  \nrenewable energy strategy for their energy use.\nEnergy Use and Emissions at Apple\u2019s Colocated Facilities\nEnergy Use\n(kWh)Renewable  Energy(kWh)Default Utility  Emissions(metric tons CO2e)Apple\u2019s Emissions - including  renewable energy(metric tons CO2e)%  Renewable Energy\nFY201 1 42,524 0 12 12 0%\nFY2012 38,552,271 1,471,680 17, 2 2 0 16,543 4%\nFY2013 79,462,860 46,966,891 31,757 14,493 59%\nFY2014 108,659,693 88,553,380 44,338 10,976 81%\nFY2015 142,615,026 121,086,061 60,495 12,740 85%\nRegional Energy Use at Apple\u2019s Colocated Facilities (Fiscal Year 2015)\nEnergy Use\n(kWh)Renewable Energy(kWh)%  Renewable Energy\nU.S. 75,671,765 75,671,765 100%\nEurope 36,595,776 36,595,776 100%\nAPAC 29,91 1,090 8,818,520 29%\nOther 436,395 0 0%\nFY2015 TOTAL 142,615,026 121,086,061 85%", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
