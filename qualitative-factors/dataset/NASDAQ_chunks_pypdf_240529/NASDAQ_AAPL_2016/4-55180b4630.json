So is what we\u2019re doing \nabout it.\nIn 2015, 93 percent of our energy came from renewable sources. And we\u2019re constantly \nlooking for ways to get to 100 percent. In Singapore, we\u2019re powering our facilities  with a 32-megawatt solar project spread over more than 800 rooftops. In China, we\u2019re adding 170 megawatts of solar to begin offsetting the energy used to make our  \nproducts. And our data centers around the world run on 100 percent clean energy  and power billions of iMessages, answers from Siri, and song downloads from iTunes.\nCarbon Footprint\nA more complex carbon footprint requires \nmore inventive solutions.\nWhen we measure our carbon footprint, we include hundreds of suppliers, millions of \ncustomers, and hundreds of millions of devices. And we\u2019re always looking for ways to make the biggest difference in five major areas: manufacturing, product use, facilities, transportation, and recycling.\nWe design each generation of our products to be as energy efficient as possible.  \nWe\u2019re sourcing lower-carbon materials to make our devices, and we\u2019re partnering  \nwith suppliers to add clean energy to their facilities. We produce and procure clean, renewable energy to power 93 percent of our offices, retail stores, and data centers around the world, which has lowered emissions from our facilities to 1 percent of  our comprehensive carbon footprint. We\u2019re also adjusting our recycling practices  and rethinking our shipping strategies.93%\nCurrently, 93 percent of our facilities  \nworldwide run on renewable energy.\nCO2e Emissions per Product (kg)  \nWe\u2019\nve decreased carbon emissions per  \nproduct every  year sinc\ne 201 1.2010 201 1 201 2 201 3 201 4 201 5131.21 37.21 26.7\n124.1122.1\n1 14.2", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
