Existing recycling techniques, like shredding, only recover a few \nkinds of materials and often diminish their quality. So we invented Liam, a line of \nrobots designed to disassemble 1.2 million phones a year, sorting all their high-quality \ncomponents and reducing the need to mine more resources from the earth. Liam  \nprototypes are operating in California and the Netherlands. It\u2019s an experiment in recy -\ncling technology, and we hope this kind of thinking will inspire others in our industry.\nAdditionally, we\u2019re committed to making sure all the waste created by our final assem -\nbly facilities and by us is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted \ninto energy. It\u2019s an ambitious goal that requires collaboration among multiple Apple teams, local governments, and specialty recyclers, but we\u2019ve already seen great success. \nIn 2015, our facility in Cork, Ireland, was the first outside North America to receive UL\u2019s \nZero Waste to Landfill validation. In 2016, our final assembly  sit es, Foxconn Guanlan and \nFoxconn Taiyuan, were  the first to receive this validation in China, and all our remaining \niPhone and Apple Watch final assembly sites are on track to do the same before 2017 .5 \nAnd most recently, all our stores worldwide have initiated zero waste programs.\nWe found that our final assembly supplier facilities were already diverting on aver-\nage 70 percent of the waste generated from manufacturing, cafeterias, and employee support facilities. The challenge was to address the remaining 30 percent\u2014the small, \nlow- or no-value, mixed waste materials that most recyclers will not accept. We worked \nclosely with our suppliers to find innovative ways to reduce, recycle, eliminate, or incin -\nerate this waste for energy recovery. For example, at many of our iPhone and Apple \nWatch final assembly facilities, we implemented waste sorting on the line to separate \npreviously landfilled recyclable waste. We also implemented a component tray reuse program for iPhone, allowing single-use trays to flow through the supply chain mul-\ntiple times. At other sites, suppliers established waste reduction campaigns and worked \nwith local recyclers to process materials not previously accepted. In response to this program, all iPhone and Apple Watch final assembly suppliers now have \u201czero waste\u201d  \nor \u201cgreen\u201d teams to support this program and other environmental improvements.\nAt our corporate offices and retail stores, wherever possible we\u2019ve created robust  \nrecycling and composting programs to minimize the environmental impact of the \nwaste we produce. In fiscal year 2015, we generated approximately 13.1 million pounds \nof waste, and diverted over 22.5 million pounds of materials from landfill through  \nrecycling and composting. Our rate of landfill diversion was 63 percent, compared  \nwith 68 percent in fiscal year 2014. We are working to improve our landfill diversion rate through a variety of actions, including expanding composting at our corporate  campuses, and initiating zero waste at our more than 470 retail stores.
