{"page_content": "25\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2016 Progress Report, Covering FY2015It took us four years to remove polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, from our power cords and \nheadphone cables. We tested dozens of formulations until we finally found the right \nblend of durability, safety, and environmental performance in our PVC replacement \nmaterials: nonchlorinated and nonbrominated thermoplastic elastomers. \nThe worst toxins and what we\u2019ve done  \nabout them.\nAfter we identify toxins in our products, we reduce them, remove them, or develop new materials that are safer. These efforts also remove toxins from our manufacturing \nand recycling processes, which protects workers and keeps pollutants out of the land, \nair, and water.\nBeryllium\nFound in copper alloys used to make  connectors and springs. All new products  are designed without the use of beryllium.  MercuryEliminated in 2009. We use energy-efficient, mercury-free LEDs instead of mercury-based fluorescent lamps in all our displays.\nLeadWe completely phased lead out of our  display glass and solder in 2006.ArsenicTraditionally used in glass. Our display  glass has been arsenic-free since 2008. \nPVC and PhthalatesBoth are still used by other companies  in power cords and headphone cables.  We have replaced PVC and phthalates  with thermoplastic elastomers.\n11Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs)Eliminated from thousands of parts such as enclosures, circuit boards, and connectors in 2008. We use safer metal hydroxides and phosphorus compounds in their place. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
