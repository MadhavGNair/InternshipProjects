Where appropriate, this approach follows \nmethodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments. \nThis review comprises a check of fiber data for selected products, which are most \ninfluential to the overall company fiber footprint and which represent the full spectrum of Apple products. The selection of products for individual reviews has been agreed between Apple and Fraunhofer IZM. \nPlausibility of some supplier data has been questioned and discussed in detail with Apple. \nBased on direct supplier feedback related fiber data has been corrected. \nThis review was done remotely. All questions raised in the course of the review were \nanswered by Apple and related evidence was provided where needed.   \nBased on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the corporate \nfiber footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of fiber data and information. The excellent analysis meets the principles of good scientific practice.    \n \nBerlin, March 29, 2016 \n  \n- Karsten Schischke -  - Marina Proske - \nFraunhofer IZM  Fraunhofer IZM \nDept.
