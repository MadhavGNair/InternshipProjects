As is typical, these emissions are tracked separately from our 100 percent renewable energy claim.\n  Sc ope 2 emissions result from electricity use for facilities. In addition, in fiscal year 2014, Apple owned a facility in Mesa, Arizona, that was operated by a supplier, which had default grid emissions of 1 5 1,279 tons  \nCO2e and effective emissions of 0 tons CO 2e in fiscal year 2014. It was removed from operation in fiscal year 201 5.\n \u2014 = E nergy source not yet online.\n *Default Utility Emissions are based on utility-scale and regional default grid emission factors (using the most granular data set available).", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 30, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
