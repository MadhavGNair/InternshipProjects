This review and verification focuses on \nScope 3 emissions for products sold by Apple Inc. (as defined by WRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse \nGas Protocol \u2013 Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard).

The life cycle emissions data produced by Apple for individual products has been calculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/14044: Environmental \nmanagement \u2013 Life cycle assessment \u2013 Principles and framework / Requirements and \nguidelines. This review and verification furthermore complies with ISO 14064-3: \nGreenhouse gases -- Part 3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification \nof greenhouse gas assertions.  \nThe review of the corporate annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria: \n\uf0a7 The system, boundaries and functional unit are clearly defined \n\uf0a7 Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate \n41", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 40, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
