{"page_content": "21\nEnvironmental Responsibility Report  |  2016 Progress Report, Covering FY2015Reducing carbon emissions helps the planet \nin more ways than one. \nOur move to 100 percent renewable energy has conserved a lot of water. That\u2019s \nbecause traditional fossil-fuel sources of energy consume a substantial amount of water. Water is consumed during fuel extraction, refining and processing, and often during power generation. For example, cooling fossil fuel-based power plants requires large quantities of water. By contrast, many renewable energy generation technologies don\u2019t rely on combustion processes, so they use much less or no water to generate electricity. \nIn California alone, where the electricity our operations use is sourced from 100 percent \nrenewable energy\u2014primarily wind\u2014we avoided over 135 million gallons of water  consumption in fiscal year 2015. And globally, our use of 93 percent renewable energy avoided over 566 million gallons of water consumption in fiscal year 2015.\n6\nForestry \nWe\u2019re not just protecting forests.  \nWe\u2019re protecting generations of them.\nForests provide wood fiber for the paper we use in our packaging. They also clean our air, purify our water, and shelter our wildlife. So we work hard to minimize our impact by sourcing paper responsibly and using it as efficiently as possible. But that\u2019s not enough. The world\u2019s forests still face widespread destruction due to illegal logging,  poor management, and aggressive land development. That\u2019s why we\u2019re determined to protect and create enough responsibly managed forests around the world to cover all our packaging needs and produce fiber for generations.\n7All our suppliers must adhere to our \nApple Sustainable Fiber Specification.\nLearn more > \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
