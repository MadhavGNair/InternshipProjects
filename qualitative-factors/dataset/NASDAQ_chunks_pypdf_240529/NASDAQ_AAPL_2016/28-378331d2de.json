We estimate natural gas usage in offices and retail stores where we are not billed based \non usage (e.g., leased office space or retail stores within malls). This more accurate methodology resulted in a decrease in emissions in fiscal year 2015.  \n 2In fiscal year 2015, we adjusted our methodology to reflect actual travel instead of booked travel. Using this more accurate methodology revealed overestimates for previous years.\n 3Only total electricity usage data was available for fiscal year 2012.\n 4 Not included in this figure is a facility in Mesa, Arizona, which Apple owned in fiscal year 2014, but was operated by a supplier. It generated 282 million kilowatt-hours of electricity\u2014 100 percent of which was covered by our renewable energy program. The facility was removed from operation in fiscal year 2015.\n 5 We calculate our progress toward 100 percent renewable energy on a calendar year basis. In calendar year 2015, we used 1048 million kilowatt-hours electricity and 977 million kilowatt-hours \nin renewable electricity.\n 6Prior to fiscal year 2015, composted quantities were reported as part of the \u201crecycled\u201d figure.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
