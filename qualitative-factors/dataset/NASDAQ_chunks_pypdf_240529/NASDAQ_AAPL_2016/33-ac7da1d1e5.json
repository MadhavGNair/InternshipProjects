We \nhit this milestone in January 2013, when we began serving the data center with energy \nsourced primarily from California wind power. We\u2019re acquiring this energy directly from \nthe wholesale market through California\u2019s Direct Access program. Late this year, when our 130-megawatt solar project in Monterey County, California, comes online, we\u2019ll use \nDirect Access to supply power from that project directly to our data center as well as \nother Apple facilities in California.\nNewark, California\u2014100% renewable since January 2013\nPacific Gas & Electric Default Grid Mix Apple Actual Renewable Energy Use\nNatural Gas 24% Bundled Grid (mostly wind) 63%\nNuclear 21% Grid (mostly wind) 37%\nOther/Unspecified 21%\nRenewable 34%\n2015 Default Emissions \n(mtons CO 2e/year26,519 2015 Effective Emissions \n(mtons CO 2e/year0\nwww.energy.ca.gov/sb1305/labels/2014_labels/   \nall_labels/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_(PGandE).pdfActual fiscal year 2015 energy data\nResource Advisor generated utility emissions values (utility-specific data).\nPrineville, Oregon\nTo support our Prineville data center, we built our first two micro-hydro systems  \nthat harness the power of water flowing through local irrigation canals that have \nbeen operating for over 60 years. These micro-hydro projects will generate 12 million \nkilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy a year. To supplement this micro-hydro gen -\neration, we\u2019re able to directly access enough local wind energy to power the  \nentire data center.  \nPrineville, Oregon\u2014100% renewable since opening May 2012\nPacific Power Default Grid Mix Apple Actual Renewable Energy Use\nCoal 61% Oregon Wind 89%\nNatual Gas 13% Utility Green 1%\nOther 11 % Apple\u2019s Micro-Hydro Projects 10%\nRenewable 15%\n2015 Default Emissions \n(mtons CO 2e/year39,507 2015 Effective Emissions \n(mtons CO 2e/year0\nwww.pacificpower.net/about/rr/ori.html   \nfrom PowerContent\u2014Large Non ResidentialActual fiscal year 2015 energy data\nResource Advisor generated utility emissions values (utility-specific data).Wind\nWind + Micro-Hydro", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AAPL_2016.pdf", "page": 33, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
