Here \nwe feature a small selection produced during 2011. \nMore examples are\u00a0available online.*Campaign: \tJumbled\nClient :\u2002Avril \u2002Elizabeth \u2002Home\nWPP\tcompany: \u2002JWT, \u2002Johannesburg\nAvril Elizabeth is a care home for intellectually and \nphysically disabled individuals. Avril Elizabeth relies \nheavily on public donations to enable them to provide \ncare for many of their residents who are orphaned \nor\u00a0abandoned. \nIn 2011, JWT worked pro bono to create a \npromotional television and cinema commercial \nstarring residents of Avril Elizabeth Home to help \ntouch the public\u2019s empathy and prompt donations. \nDisabled residents of Avril Elizabeth Home held up \na\u00a0series of word cards to form sentences. Even though \nthe spelling of the words were deliberately \u2018jumbled\u2019, \nthe sentences still made sense. In the same way, even \nthough the residents of Avril Elizabeth Home may \nbe\u00a0a little different, this doesn\u2019t change their value.\nJWT negotiated free media space on behalf of \nAvril Elizabeth Home, gaining several prime-time \nslots in local cinemas to help raise awareness and \nfunds. JWT also elicited the help of a mobile media \nagency to enable donors to make monthly donations \nvia their phone accounts.\nThe pro bono campaign, worth $170,000, \nwon\u00a0a\u00a0Bronze Cannes Lion and a Bronze Loerie.\n *wpp.com/sustainability\nView \u2002the\u2002video \u2002at\u2002wpp.com/sustainability", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_WPPGY_2011.pdf", "page": 63, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
