{"page_content": "CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT ANSYS  19\nMORE SUSTAINABLE DESIGN FOR ENERGY \nSYSTEMS\nMore directly, ANSYS solutions are used to accelerate \ninnovation and ensure sustainable design for energy \nsystems.\nConsider the design and development of a tree-like wind \npower generator with steel branches and plastic leaves. \nANSYS customer New Wind used engineering simulation \nto help create an aesthetically pleasing alternative \nenergy source for urban environments, bringing energy \ngeneration closer to people. Aeroleaf\u00ae design enables \nenergy production by capturing wind in specially shaped \nplastic \u201cleaves\u201d. New Wind engineers were able to design \nand predict the real-world operation of the aerodynamic, \nstructural and electromagnetic parameters of the wind \ntree that their company\u2019s founder had envisioned only a \nfew years before.\nYou can read more about how our products help energy \nsystem simulation in Breakthrough Energy Innovation.SOLUTIONS FOR INDUSTRIES AND \nEMERGING TECHNOLOGIES\nIn addition to clean technology and renewable energy \nsystems, ANSYS solutions are used by industry segments \nmost expected to change and be disrupted1 by innovation \nand sustainability requirements. Primary industries \ninclude the Automotive, Energy , Mining , Water and \nWastewater , High-Tech and Industrial industries. ANSYS \nhas also been developing solutions catered to emerging \ntechnologies for Autonomous Vehicles, energy storage \nand Battery Management Systems and manufacturing \nthrough the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and  \nAdditive Manufacturing .01 Clean Technology Contributions Through ANSYS Products\n1Source: https://www.cleantech.com/industries/ accessed on 8/3/18\nImage courtesy of New Wind", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANSS_2018.pdf", "page": 18, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
