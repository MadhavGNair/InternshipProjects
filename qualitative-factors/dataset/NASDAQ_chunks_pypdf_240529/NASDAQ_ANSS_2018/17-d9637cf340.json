{"page_content": "CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT ANSYS  18\n01 Clean Technology Contributions Through ANSYS Products\nAt ANSYS, we recognize that sustainability and the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy are fundamental \ndrivers of business and technology.\nFor nearly five decades, we have worked with our \ncustomers and partners to help design, develop and \noperate products to reduce carbon emissions, from \nnuclear reactors to electric cars. ANSYS solutions \nhelp pioneers of modern technology to evaluate new \nconcepts and accelerate product development using \ncomputational methods by enabling them to  \nvirtually test the performance of their products and \nprocesses for real-life deployment. Engineering \nsimulation is useful for most environmental  \nand sustainability applications including energy \nefficiency, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and \nreduced water usage.ENERGY-EFFICIENT CONFIGURATIONS FOR \nCUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS\nApplications of ANSYS solutions are not just for energy \nand power generation companies. Benefits can be seen \nacross the entire supply chain of products and services. \nExamples include:\n +Reduce material usage and weight (lightweighting), \nlowering transportation and construction costs \n +Electrify transportation, industrial machinery and \ndistributed power\n +Develop more energy-efficient equipment and increase \nsystem energy intensity \n +Reduce emissions, capture pollutants\n +Reduce waste water and process heat \n +Recapture material (recycle) \nAs a result, ANSYS customers can innovate and evolve \ntheir products to work towards a lower carbon footprint \nfor the entire product life cycle.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ANSS_2018.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
