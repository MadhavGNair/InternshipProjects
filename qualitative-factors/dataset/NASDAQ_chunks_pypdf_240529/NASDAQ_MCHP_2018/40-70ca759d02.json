The EggBot uses a sharpie \nto draw images on an egg, or in \nthis case a ping pong ball, using \nInkscape software. They were able \nto draw custom images and took \nrequests throughout the event \nto engage students, sparking \ntheir interest in engineering, \nmanufacturing, and technology. STUDENT INTERNS AT \nMTHAI LEARN SKILLS \nFOR SUCCESS\nIn 2018, Microchip signed a signed \na Memorandum of Understanding \nwith Chachoengsao\nVocational College in Thailand as \npart of an internship program. \nThe intensive training program \nputs students in real-life situations \nworking for our world-class \norganization. Microchip mentors \nteach interns technical skills that \ncan be used in specific settings at \nthe company, but are also focused \non teaching key skills that include \ncritical thinking, teamwork, and time \nmanagement. \nWhen students finish their \ninternships with Microchip, their \nexperiences with us combined with \ntheir continuing education will result \nin a stronger workforce, both at \nMicrochip and for our entire industry.MICROCHIP ROMANIA \nWELCOMES 80 \nSTUDENTS DURING \nOPEN DAY\nMore than 80 students attended \nMicrochip Romania\u2019s Open Day, an \nevent targeted at students pursuing \na career in electronics or software \ndevelopment, to enhance their \nknowledge about the industry. \nStudents learned about the \ncompany, attended a job-shop \nevent to learn about careers and \ninternships, visited the laboratory, \nand connected the students \nwith advice on courses of study \nthat will help them start careers \nin the electronics and software \ndevelopment industries. The \nhands-on learning experiences and \npresentations by our engineers \noffered a glimpse into the key skills \nand specific knowledge needed to \ndevelop Microchip products.  \nOpen Day is about promoting \nopportunities within Microchip, \nbut is also crucial to helping raise \nawareness regarding the electronics \nfield in general.
