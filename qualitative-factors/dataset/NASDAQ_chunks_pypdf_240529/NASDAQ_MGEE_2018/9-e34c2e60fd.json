Combined, the two utilities would own a  \ntotal of 300 MW, if regulators approve the projects. \nThe Badger Hollow Solar Farm would be located in \nsouthwestern Wisconsin. MGE would own 50 MW of Badger \nHollow. The Two Creeks solar project would be located near \nthe Point Beach \nNuclear Power Plant  \nin northeastern \nWisconsin. MGE  \nwould own 50 MW  \nof Two Creeks. If \napproved by the  \nend of 2018, \nconstruction of both  \nprojects is expected to \nbegin by spring 2019. \nThe installations \nwould come online  \nby the end of 2020. \nMGE also is working to expand our Shared Solar program, \nwhich began with a 500-kilowatt (kW) array in the City of \nMiddleton in 2017. We are developing a waiting list of \ninterested customers for a second Shared Solar installation. \nThe Shared Solar program delivers locally generated clean \nenergy to subscribing customers. Wind energy\nOur Saratoga wind farm in northeast Iowa is expected  \nto come online by early 2019. MGE\u2019s largest wind farm to \ndate, the 66-MW wind farm near Saratoga, Iowa,  \nwill deliver cost-effective, clean energy to about  \n47,000 households. \nIn 2018, MGE also purchased a 16-MW share of the Forward \nEnergy Center wind farm in Wisconsin. When combined with \nthe Saratoga wind farm, the purchase grows MGE-owned \nwind generation by more than 200%.\nCrews prepare a foundation for one of 33 turbines  \nat MGE\u2019s Saratoga wind farm.\nMGE partnered with the City of Middleton for our Shared Solar installation on the roof of the city\u2019s Municipal Operations Center.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2018.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
