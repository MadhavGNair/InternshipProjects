That type of work can impact \nnatural resources.\nMGE implemented a process improvement to ensure \nimpacts are minimized or mitigated before construction \nprojects begin. \nWe focus on several areas of potential impact  \nto natural resources:\n\u2022 Erosion control\n\u2022 Stormwater management\n\u2022 Wetlands impacts\n\u2022 Archaeological impacts\n\u2022 Threatened and endangered species impacts\n\u2022 Shoreland impacts\n\u2022 Previous site contamination management\n\u2022 Water discharge management Our project managers submit an electronic notification  \nwith initial project information before work is scheduled. \nSafety and environmental affairs staff screen those details \nto determine if further information is required for obtaining \nspecial permits and approvals or if other steps are needed \nprior to construction.\nOur process serves to maintain internal workflow  \nefficiency to benefit our customers who depend  \non their safe, reliable utility services while ensuring  \nwork resulting from construction projects prevents  \nor mitigates potential environmental impacts.From water and land to air and animals, MGE takes steps to protect our natural resources. This means doing our  \npart to help improve waterways, preserve the natural beauty of ou r communities and protect wildlife and habitats.\nMGE works to restore the landscape to its original state \nafter completing construction projects, such as this gas \nexpansion project.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MGEE_2018.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
