This voluntary, statewide \nsustainability program uses an objective, points-based evaluation  \nto place companies in one of three categories. The top 20% of the \ncompanies achieve the Green Master distinction. MGE was the first \nutility in Wisconsin to be designated a Green Master.\nTransparency and disclosure\nThrough our participation in EEI\u2019s ESG/Sustainability reporting \ntemplate, our investors and customers can find transparent and \nmeaningful information about our performance. Within the EEI \ntemplate, which we will update annually, readers will find additional \ninformation about our generation, emissions, capital investments, \nhuman resources and other ESG-related disclosures.\nSince we set our goals for Energy 2030 and 2050, we have said  \nthat if we can go further faster by working with our customers, we  \nwill.  We are committed to customer and stakeholder engagement  \nto reach shared sustainability goals. \nThroughout this report, we highlight our commitment to advance \nclean energy and sustainable practices, to continuously improve \nworkforce safety, and to contribute to the health and vitality of our \ncommunities.
