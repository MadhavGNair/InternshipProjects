Avendra also requires \nsuppliers to submit a sustainability policy that is \nrelevant to that supplier\u2019s industry impacts, including \nenvironmental and social business practices.\nIn 2021, we continued our focus on procuring more \nenvironmentally and socially responsible products \nwithin our top 10 categories. Together with Avendra, \nwe assessed the environmental and social business \naspects of our existing North America, Caribbean, and \nLatin America suppliers, within our top 10 categories, \nvia the Ecovadis sustainability assessment platform. \nThrough this platform and survey, Avendra engaged 89% of contracted spend with manufacturers and \n80% of contracted spend with distributors within \nMarriott\u2019s top 10 categories in North America, the \nCaribbean, and Latin America. As of year-end 2021, \n52% of manufacturers and 32% of distributors have \ncompleted the Ecovadis assessment.\nThrough 2023, Marriott plans to continue to evaluate \nour remaining global suppliers using the Ecovadis \nplatform. This information will be used to develop \nimprovement plans for suppliers that are deemed \n\u201cunderperformers\u201d to help them meet the responsible \nsourcing requirements that have been determined for \neach of the top 10 categories by the end of 2025.\nTo support Marriott\u2019s efforts to promote responsible \nsourcing, associates with procurement and \npurchasing responsibilities are also required to \ncomplete the Procurement 101 online training, \nwhich includes information on Marriott\u2019s human \nrights policies.\nPhoto Caption: Marriott hotels help to preserve the mangrove forests of Langkawi in Malaysia.\nMonitoring \nDeforestation & \nClimate Impacts \nThrough Avendra, Marriott engages \nwith major suppliers regarding the \nfour highest deforestation impact \ncommodities  (paper, soy, palm, \nand beef) on their no-deforestation \nprograms and policies. In 2022, \nAvendra expects to survey the suppliers \nwhose products or operations have \nhigh GHG emissions intensities and \nengage with them to understand \ncurrent and future planned efforts to \nreduce their carbon footprints.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2022.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
