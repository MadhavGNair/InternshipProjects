Marriott\u2019s Engineering \nGlobal Leadership Team, which includes cross-regional representation, conducts \nregular engagement exercises to drive MESH data integrity and participation.\nTo further execute on the company\u2019s energy and emissions reduction strategy, \nMarriott\u2019s Engineering Business Leadership Councils and teams, composed of \nhotel-based Engineering Discipline Leaders and Facility Services Directors from \nspecific geographic markets, meet quarterly to review the company\u2019s performance \nagainst the Serve 360 carbon reduction and renewable energy goals. \nScience-Based Targets\nIn September 2021, Marriott submitted a letter to the Science Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi), committing to set a science-based emissions reduction target, \nin line with 1.5\u00b0C emissions scenarios, and set a long-term science-based target \nto reach net-zero value chain GHG emissions by no later than 2050. As part of \nthis commitment, the company also signed on to the Race to Zero via the most \nambitious standard, Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C.\nThe company is currently preparing the submission for Marriott\u2019s near-term targets \nand developing longer-term strategies to support those targets. This includes \nreviewing Scope 1 and 2 data and time horizons and evaluating Scope 3 emissions \nfor baseline, tracking, and reporting.Improving Energy Efficiencies\nGlobally, Marriott properties and their ownership groups evaluate energy \nefficiency investment opportunities, including the implementation of energy and \nenvironmental action plans, signature projects, retro-commissioning, lighting \nretrofits, and building automation systems. For example, in 2021, numerous Marriott \nmanaged hotels implemented energy efficiency projects, saving approximately \n130,000 MWhs of energy.\nThe Halifax Marriott\u00ae Harbourfront Hotel (Nova Scotia, Canada) installed the \nEcopilot\u00ae North America \u2013 AI for Commercial HVAC System to reduce energy \nusage and costs and improve indoor occupant comfort. The system resulted \nin an electricity savings of approximately 20% and natural gas savings of \nnearly 18% in 2021 .\nThe JW Marriott Washington, DC (Washington, D.C., U.S.) was recognized \nwith the 2021 global Energy Management Leadership award , one of the \nhighest accolades in energy management and conservation, for reducing \napproximately 725 metric tons of carbon emissions  over three years. \nIn 2021, Marriott engaged with Convergence Energy Services Limited in India \nto install Electric Vehicle (EV) charging units across hotels in India . This \nproject plans to expand to 100 hotels in 2022.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2022.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
