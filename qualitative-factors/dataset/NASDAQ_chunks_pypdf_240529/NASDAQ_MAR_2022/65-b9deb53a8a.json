This Board meets quarterly \nand provides executive-level oversight \nand strategic risk management \nwith respect to our Ethics & Global \nCompliance Program. Preexisting \ngovernance committees, which oversee the implementation and management \nof our program, including those \noperating at the regional level, continue \nto function and now report directly \ninto the Ethics & Global Compliance \nGovernance Board. The Ethics & \nGlobal Compliance Governance \nBoard provides a report at least once \nannually to the Audit Committee.\nRisk Assessments\nMarriott monitors ethics and \ncompliance risk through various \nprocesses with second and third lines \nof defense by using a risk-based \nsampling methodology and giving \nconsideration to properties where any \nbusiness ethics matters or concerns \nhave been raised. The company\u2019s Internal Audit Department performs \nan annual risk assessment of owned, \nleased, and managed hotels, and \nidentifies properties to be audited \nbased on specific anti-corruption and \nother risk factors. \nThe Internal Audit Department, in \ncoordination with Marriott\u2019s Law \nDepartment, has also developed and \ndeployed a global anti-corruption \nproperty review program and \ntoolkit designed to detect issues \nand provide remediation actions as \nneeded at the hotel level. Periodically, \nMarriott also issues property-level \nguidance to address anti-corruption \nrisk, including protocols to mitigate \nthird-party risk. We expect to continue \nto evaluate opportunities to improve Marriott\u2019s compliance posture by \nfocusing on methods and tools for \nmeasuring, assessing, and auditing \neffectiveness of the compliance \nprogram, including periodically using \nthird-party consultants and external \nbenchmarking data.\nTo investigate and address ethics \nand compliance concerns, Marriott \nemploys a multidisciplinary approach. \nThe company uses a triage process for \nthe initial assessment and assignment \nincluding standard investigative \npractices such as witness interviews \nand reviews of evidentiary materials. \nThe investigation process includes \nappropriate discipline and remediation \nas needed. \nPhoto Caption: Associates at the Aruba Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino (Noord, Aruba). \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MAR_2022.pdf", "page": 65, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
