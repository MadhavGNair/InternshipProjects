We believe in transparency in our practices and that political participation at all levels \nof government is important to our business.\nAdvocating for the Future\nIn 2021, the majority of our advocacy was focused \non supporting our business, owners, franchisees, \nand impacted associates in COVID-19 pandemic-\nrelated relief and recovery measures at the local, \nstate, and federal level. While we understand nothing \ncan replace a robust travel economy, the policies we \npursued helped provide a bridge and government \nsupport for stakeholders and the industry.\nMarriott is committed to participating in the political \nprocess to promote its interests and business objectives, without regard to the political preferences \nof its executives. We support candidates seeking \nelected office at the federal, state, and local level in \nthe United States through Marriott\u2019s employee-funded \nPolitical Action Committee (PAC). \nMarriott is a member of numerous industry and \nbusiness associations, including the Business \nRoundtable, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nWorld Travel & Tourism Council, American Hotel \n& Lodging Association, International Franchise Association, the World Economic Forum, and the \nU.S. Travel Association.
