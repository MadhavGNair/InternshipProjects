{"page_content": "43\nTower Semiconductor's 2020 Corporate Sustainability (ESG) ReportClimate change brings with it a variety of \nenvironmental risks that may negatively \naffect Tower\u2019s business operations, including \nresource scarcity. \nIncreased attention to environmental \nconcerns from the scientific community and \npolicy makers has resulted in an increase in \nenvironmental legislation that has significant \nconsequences for businesses. Legislative \ndevelopments mandating a reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions may result in \nincreased energy prices and higher costs \nfor transportation, equipment, and raw \nmaterials. \nTower is also subject to a variety of \nlaws and regulations relating to the use, \ndischarge, and disposal of toxic or other \nhazardous materials. Complying with \ncurrent legislation as well as anticipating \nfuture laws which may be implemented is critical to the risk-management of the \ncompany.\nIn addition to these concerns, scientists \nhave predicted that more frequent droughts, \nfloods, extreme weather conditions, and \nrising sea levels will likely occur due to climate \nchange. These may impact transportation and \nproduction across many industries. While the \nscale of these challenges is difficult to predict, \nTower recognizes the risk presented by these \ndevelopments and the need to monitor and \nadapt to ongoing environmental changes.\nTower strives to manage these risks and \nreduce potential adverse environmental \nimpact on our operations, in order to \nprotect long-term value and run our \nbusiness as sustainably as possible. \nEnvironmental risks are monitored and \nmitigated through our environmental \nmanagement system. \nTower is committed to create sustainable \nenvironmental impact on the world through \nminimizing the effects of its own operations.\nOur activities focus in multiple areas, \nincluding: environmental permits and \nreporting, pollution prevention and resource \nreduction, hazardous substances, wastewater \nand solid waste, air emissions, and product \ncontent restrictions. \nThe environmental management \nsystem implemented throughout Tower\u2019s \nfacilities in Israel and the US are certified \nby the International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO) 14001, designed \nto promote and guide an environmental \nmanagement approach which is both \neffective and comprehensive.\nEssential components of our corporate \nenvironmental approach include reducing \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, managing \nenergy consumption and improving energy \nefficiency during manufacturing; managing water use and minimizing risks associated \nwith water quality and availability; reducing \nand managing waste generated during \nmanufacturing; \nminimizing product \nlifecycle impacts \nthrough innovation in \nproduct design and \nbusiness practices, \nincluding managing the \nsupply chain to minimize \nrisks associated with the \nsourcing of sensitive or \nrare minerals.Environmental Risks\nOur Environmental Strategy\nManagement Approach\nWe are very pleased with the results we are \nseeing from our initiatives to strengthen our \n\"green\" focus and continue activities supporting \nenvironmental sustainability. Across all of our \noperations, we will intensify efforts to reduce \nenvironmental impact and implement forward-\nthinking policies for future environmental concerns\n\u201c\n\u201cRafi Mor, \nChief Operating Officer\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TSEM_2020.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
