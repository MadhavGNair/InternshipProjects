We have also reduced brine disposal by 50%. \nRecycling reverse osmosis (RO) reject water (the concentrated non-pure stream of water remaining \nfrom the reverse osmosis water purifying process) in the NPB Fab, saves 128,207m3 of water annually.\nWater Reuse  \nThe air in San Antonio is very dense and humid. As part of the process of drying the air in the fab, \nwe implemented, approximately ten years ago, a system to collect the humidity from the air and \nreuse it. For the last 3 years, this process saved approximately 28,390m3 of water per year. Since \nthe implementation of this system, 251,351m3 of water has been reused.  \nIn Newport Beach, we reuse rinse water that is taken from wet sinks, in abatement tools and \nscrubbers. This process yields around 162,875m3 of reused water annually.CASE STUDY\nCASE STUDY", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TSEM_2020.pdf", "page": 48, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
