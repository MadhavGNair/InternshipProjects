As a result, the amount of Migdal \nHaemek solvent waste decreased by 46%.\nIn 2019-2020, we developed and constructed a \nsystem for the removal of hydrogen peroxide from \nused sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid, which was previously \ndisposed of as hazardous waste, is now considered a \ndilute technical acid and is sold to enable reuse as a \nraw material. Another project implemented in 2020 is treatment \nby reverse osmosis of brine after regeneration of \nion exchange resin. This treatment helped us avoid \ndisposal of approximately 2,000 m3/year of brine to the \nsea and instead, this water could be re-used instead \nof tap water.\nLeaks\nDuring the reported period, there were no leaks or \nserious environmental incidents at any of our sites.HIGHLIGHT:  \nRECYCLING OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN US FABS \nThe total percentage of recycled hazardous waste in all of our US facilities was almost 68% in 2020, \ncompared to almost 50% in 2018.\nThe increase in our recycled hazardous waste is mostly due to the sulfuric acid project mentioned above.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TSEM_2020.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
