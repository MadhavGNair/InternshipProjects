{"page_content": "55\nTower Semiconductor's 2020 Corporate Sustainability (ESG) Report\nSo far, we have completed approximately \n150 risk-surveys, which revealed that the \nmain risks at Tower, as in the semiconductor \nindustry as a whole, are hazardous gases, \nchemicals, radiation and electrical risks. In \norder to minimize these risks, Tower has a \nnumber of protective systems, including \nengineering defense, administrative \nprotection, monitoring, personal protective \nequipment, ERT (emergency response team). \nIn 2020, we revamped the safety program \nto include more comprehensive risk \nassessments for improved early detection \nand prevention, as well as a formally certified \nSafety Officer.   \nMonitoring and Audits\nIn addition to upholding the requirements \naccording to ISO 45001 international \nstandard, we perform a wide range of \naudits throughout our Fabs to ensure the \nhealth and safety of our team. These audits \nare both internal and external and are \nperformed regularly to ensure continued \ncompliance.\n Employee Awareness\nand Engagement\nIn order to strengthen awareness among, \nand engagement of employees, all the H&S \ninformation is accessible on the internal \n\u201cH&S site\u201d and on the corporate bulletin \nboard. Additionally, H&S meeting and \naudit report summaries, accidents and \nevents are published on that platform for \nemployees' awareness. Employees are \nasked to submit comments and advice \nbased on prior experience with respect to \naccidents, incidents or near-miss events to \nminimize and prevent future events.\nAnnual H&S Training\nIn addition to the annual safety training \nfor all employees and orientation in H&S \nfor new employees, we provide more \nthan 80 trainings on safety subjects for \ntargeted audiences, including contractors, \ntechnicians, ionized equipment workers \nand others. Employees working in the \noutdoor industrial areas of the facilities \nreceive an advanced training in additional \ntopics such as oil spill prevention control \nand countermeasure, hazardous materials \nrisk management plan, and storm water \npollution prevention plan.H&S Performance\nOur H&S system empowers us to protect \nour employees as best as we can. We \nmonitor our performance by measuring \nmultiple factors including tracking of \naccidents (which is being counted for any \nevent that employee lost more than one \nworking day), incidents (safety event where \nemployee didn\u2019t lose any working days), \nnear-miss events and injuries by cause of the \nevent, including gas exposure, slips and falls, \nchemical exposures and leaks, mechanical \ninjuries and other factors. \nThe total number of work accidents has \nsteadily decreased between 2018 and 2020. \nDuring that period of time, there were no \non-site fatalities.\nLong-term target: to reduce the \nnumber of accidents to zero by \ncontinous improvement of our safety \nprocess and procedures, and reduce \naccidents by at least 50% by 2030.2018 201928\n2320Work Accidents\n2020\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TSEM_2020.pdf", "page": 54, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
