{"page_content": "44\nTower Semiconductor's 2020 Corporate Sustainability (ESG) ReportResponsibility Structure\nEach site has a person responsible for \nenvironmental management, reporting to \nthe site VP and with a dotted line reporting \nto the Corporate SVP of Excellence.\nCompliance with\nEnvironmental Regulation \nTower operates in accordance with the \nrequired environmental laws and regulations. \nAll required environmental permits and \nregistrations are obtained, maintained, \nand kept current. In addition, all applicable \noperational and reporting requirements are \nfollowed. This includes waste treatment, use of \nhazardous materials, protection of hazardous \nmaterials and emergency preparedness.\nDuring the reported period, we had no \ncomplaints, legal proceedings, or fines \nregarding environmental issues in Israel \nand US. \nEnvironmental Audits\nA variety of environmental internal and \nexternal audits, such as ISO 14001-2015 annual \naudit, environmental/hazardous materials \nannual audit, and annual emission tests, are \nconducted on a weekly, monthly, or yearly \nbasis, in accordance with the requirements \nset forth by various regulatory bodies (for \nmore information, see appendix).\nEmployees' Training on\nEnvironmental Issues\nAll employees who are involved in \nproduction are sufficiently trained on \nenvironmental matters by the H&S \ndepartment, including environmental \nresponsibilities, documentation and \ncompliance, ISO 14001, hazardous materials release, air quality and facility emissions, \nresource consumption, storm water quality, \nand waste and recycling.\nCircular Economy and \nLife Cycle Analysis\nExpanding use of semiconductors in \nthe economy has considerable potential \nimpact on the environment during the \ndifferent phases of production lifecycle, and \nexacerbates the impact of the industry\u2019s \nincrease in raw material use and disposal, \nincluding minerals, metals, and petroleum-\nbased resources. \nThe life cycle of a product can be divided \ninto 5 phases:\n\u25b6 Sourcing, processing and/or supplying raw \nmaterials;\n\u25b6 Manufacturing/production;\n\u25b6 Putting into circulation \u2013 transporting, \ndistributing and marketing efforts;\n\u25b6 Use, reuse and product maintenance;\n\u25b6 End of life management (recycling and \ndisposal).\nTower is responsible for the first two phases \nof the life cycle as described above. The last \nthree phases are the responsibility of our \ncustomers.\nAs a company that provides semiconductor \nsolutions, we put continuous effort into \nassisting our customers to reduce the \nenvironmental impact of their products \nthrough better energy efficiency, \nresponsible manufacturing, responsible \nproduct sourcing, water management \nand waste management. Tower is \ncommitted to reduce the carbon, waste \nand water footprints throughout the life \ncycle of its semiconductor technologies' \nmanufacturing processes.\nIntegrating Circular Economy Into Our Value Chain \nIn 2020, our facilities in Israel began \ndevelopment and construction of a \nsystem to remove hydrogen peroxide \nfrom used sulfuric acid. Tower is working \nwith partners to recycle the used sulfuric \nacid to be used as raw material. \nLong-term target: the Company\u2019s \ntarget is to reduce sulfuric acid \ndisposal by 20% annually, starting 2021.
