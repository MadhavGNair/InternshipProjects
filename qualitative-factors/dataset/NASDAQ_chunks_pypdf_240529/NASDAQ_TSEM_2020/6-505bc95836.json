It has brought all of us to an \nunderstanding that we are not separated, \nbut tied to one another, regardless of where \nwe are. The COVID-19 pandemic was a \nstrong reminder of the power of nature \nand of our weakness against it. Even with \nthe great achievement of the vaccines, \nwe are still facing the implications of this \npandemic. We had to modify the way \nwe live, learn, behave, and communicate, \namong other things. Nonetheless, it gave \nus an opportunity to come back to our \nroots and to prioritize what is important. \nThe social and personal responsibility came \nstrongly into place in order to stay safe. \nAs a company, we have been \u2018proactive\u2019 \nto the extent within our control, to \nsuccessfully manage this challenge - \nkeeping in mind the health and safety of \nour employees alongside business and \noperational continuity and remaining \ncommitted to provide reliable technology \nand manufacturing solutions. We hope that \nthe Coronavirus situation will be contained \nshortly and resolved as soon as possible for \neveryone\u2019s wellbeing, to minimize the local \nand global adverse impact it has already \ncreated, and that the one upside of this \noutbreak will be greater actions of world \ncitizenry and cooperation benefiting society \nand our planet as a whole. \nAt the core of our Company\u2019s DNA we \nbelieve that it is the foremost goal of the \ncompany to create an environment where: \n1. all employees can go home at the end of \nthe day having gained confidence through \nsuccessfully meeting challenges, with \nappropriate compensation, knowing that the confident woman/ man is a better \nmother/ father, wife/ husband; and \n2. employees with capabilities and desire \ngain skills and acknowledgment to grow \nprofessionally, personally, and financially.\nTo support this, we have developed our set of \nvalue vectors. A vector signifying magnitude \nand direction - a construct depicting \nconstant movement and progress. Those \nvalue vectors set the tone and path for who \nwe are and how we do business, and best \ndefine the core of our Company: Partnership, \nLeadership, Innovation, Impact, and at the \ncenter of our construct - Excellence, firmly \nstating \u201cexcellence embedded in everything \nwe do\u201d.  \nVarious elements of our corporate \nresponsibility, sustainability and ESG \nefforts are described in this report, and \nare all well aligned into our value vectors \nwith the mindset of excellence in each of \nthe described areas. We are continuously \nevaluating our activities in order to improve \nand ensure that our commitment and \nactions towards a better company, better \nsociety and better lives around us are met, \nand aim to further proliferate them and their \nimpact with every action we take.\nWe are \ncontinuously \nevaluating \nour activities \nin order to \nimprove \nand ensure \nthat our \ncommitment \nand actions \ntowards \na better \ncompany, \nbetter society \nand better \nlives around \nus are met.Russell Ellwanger  \nCheif Executive \nOfficer", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_TSEM_2020.pdf", "page": 6, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
