Equipment operating non-optimally can be replaced before machines break down, and it allows increased energy efficiency.Power protection and conversion solutions thermally engineered for high-density servers, storage, and networking  \nequipment to improve energy efficiency  \nand operating costs.\n5G networks are 90% more energy efficient \nthan 4G networks. Transceivers, signal chains, and algorithms enable network densification and beamforming that play  a large role in these efficiency gains.Vehicle Electrification\nElectric Vehicles\nClean ChargingCommunications\nData Centers\n5G NetworksIndustry 4.0\nFactory Automation\nPredictive Maintenance", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2020.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
