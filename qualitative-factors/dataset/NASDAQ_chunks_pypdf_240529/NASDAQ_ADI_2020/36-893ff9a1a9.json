EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION\nBonus Compensation \nOur employee bonus programs link employees\u2019 compensation to ADI\u2019s revenue and operational performance goals. We believe having all  \nemployees striving to achieve the same goals creates a common drive for excellence and celebrating achievement. \nPay Equity \nWe are committed to equitable compensation regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. Our goal is to attain 100% pay equity. To this end, we conduct regular equal pay assessments, with rigorous statistical analyses of employees performing similar work and active plans to adjust where appropriate. In the U.S., women currently earn 98 cents for every $1 earned by their male counterparts; notably, we don\u2019t see a systemic pattern of women being underpaid in the same jobs. Similar analysis of  racial pay differences in the U.S. found the same  98 cents/$1 ratio for people of color. Also, we monitor our worldwide adjusted compensation  \nfor women compared to men, working to adjust within local practices.EMPOWERING PEOPLE\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2020.pdf", "page": 36, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
