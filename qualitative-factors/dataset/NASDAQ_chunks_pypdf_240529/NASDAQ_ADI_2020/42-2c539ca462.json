To ensure our commitment to a safe operating environment, manufacturing sites have employee health  and safety committees. All four ADI legacy sites are certified to ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety management system standards, while the two sites from our acquisition of the former Linear Technology are working towards certification to the same standards. ADI incident rates and  lost workday rates are better than the rates reported by the U.S. Semiconductor Industry and U.S. Manufacturing Industry.\n2010   2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   2016   2017   2018   201 9  20201.\n20\n0.80\n0.400.000.90\n0.20\n0.13 0.12 Analog Devices (Global)U.S. Manufacturing Industry\nU.S. Semiconductor IndustryLost Workday Case Rate\nLost Workday \nRates per  100 Workers2010   2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   2016   2017   2018   201 9  20205\n.00\n4.00\n3.002.001.000.003.30\n0.90\n0.380.28 Analog Devices (Global)U.S. Manufacturing Industry\nU.S. Semiconductor IndustryIncident Rates\nIncident Rates  \nper 100 WorkersEMPOWERING PEOPLE", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADI_2020.pdf", "page": 42, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
