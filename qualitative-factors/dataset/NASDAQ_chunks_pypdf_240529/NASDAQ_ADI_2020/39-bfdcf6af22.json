Interns took part in different learning initiatives through \u201cTalk and Learns\u201d and social activities, such as a welcome event on Zoom, allowing participants to not only \u201cmeet\u201d and play icebreaker games,  but also learn more about ADI and our employee networks.Global interns accepted  \nfull-time positions50%Over\nNorth American interns  \naccepted full-time positions80%OverAddressing Unconscious Bias\n1.
