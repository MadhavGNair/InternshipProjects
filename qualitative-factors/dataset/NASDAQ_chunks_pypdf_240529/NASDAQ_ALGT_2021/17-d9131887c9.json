Design materials \u2014 such as cabinet work and \naccessories \u2014 use sustainable products with no or low volatile organic \ncompounds (VOC) in paints, sealants, adhesives and carpets. \nAll plumbing, water heating, mechanical equipment and electrical were \ndesigned to consider energy efficiency. This includes reverse cycle air-\nto-water chillers that capture ambient air to heat the hot water for the \nbuildings. We will also install water-saving plumbing fixtures to reduce our \nwater consumption. \n \nGuest rooms  \nGuests will be rewarded for taking part in our \u201cgreen\u201d program by choosing \nnot to change linens and terry every day. We are also making recycling easy \nwith clear signage and sorting systems for guests.\nAdditionally, we are eliminating single-use plastic bottles for both water and \nin-room guest amenities. Instead, we will provide refillable glass bottles in \nguest rooms with filtered water fountains available throughout the resort. \nPlus, toiletry bottles in our standard guest rooms\u2019 bathrooms are\u00a0refillable.\n \nDining and Conventions  \nGiven our proximity to agricultural-heavy counties, we plan to source food \nand beverage products from local farmers. All our convention sales kits are \nmade from recycled paper materials except for the outside wrap.\nGuest room  \nArtist rendering\nMain ballroom  \nArtist rendering\n18 2021 Allegiant ESG Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALGT_2021.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
