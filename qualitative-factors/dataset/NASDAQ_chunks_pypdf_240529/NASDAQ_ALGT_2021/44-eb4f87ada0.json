In governing Allegiant, our independent board members serve on \nthree committees that define their responsibilities: Audit , Compensation  and \nNominating and Governance . \nTo promote accountability, board members are subject to election every year. \nOur board consists of eight board members, six of whom are independent \ndirectors. The board rotates the role of lead independent director among the \nindependent board members. To uphold board independence and further \npromote accountability, we separated the roles of chairman of the board and \nchief executive officer (CEO) as of June 1, 2022.\nIn our commitment to diversity, we achieved a board on which 25% are female \nand 12.5% racially/ethnically diverse. In late 2021, we welcomed Sandra Douglass \nMorgan to the board. Ms. Morgan serves as the President of the Las Vegas Raiders \nfootball team. She is the immediate past Chairwoman of the Nevada Gaming \nControl Board, becoming the first African American to have served as Chair.\nImplicit in our working philosophy is the \nimportance of sound corporate governance. \nThis starts at the top with our Board of Directors \nand is evident throughout our management \nteam, team members and suppliers.Committing to High \nStandards in All We Do\n25% \nfemale Our Board of Directors is:\n12.5%  \nracially/ethnically diverse\n45 2021 Allegiant ESG Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALGT_2021.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
