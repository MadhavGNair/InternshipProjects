We manage pilot and flight attendant schedules according to \nFAA regulations on crew member hours. CBAs for pilots and flight \nattendants also outline health and safety requirements including \nmaximum hours of service. \n   Our Fatigue Risk Management Program (FRMP) helps control \nor mitigate fatigue risks in aviation operations. This data-driven \nprocess allows for continuous monitoring and management of safety \nrisks associated with fatigue-related errors, including identifying \npotential hazards, assessing associated risks and implementing \nmitigation\u00a0factors. \n   Our Fatigue Risk Review Committee (FRRC) evaluates reports of \nfatigue to identify potential trends.\n   Union representatives are active members of several Allegiant \nhealth and safety committees. These include the FRRC, where they \nhelp ensure outputs are non-punitive and enhance pilot capabilities, \nand the Event Review Committee (ERC), which investigates \nreported\u00a0events. \n35 2021 Allegiant ESG Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALGT_2021.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
