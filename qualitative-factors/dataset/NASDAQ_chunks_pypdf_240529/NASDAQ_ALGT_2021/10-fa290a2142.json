To \ndecrease our aviation-related GHG emissions, we continually take steps to be  \nmore fuel efficient. \nAircraft with greater fuel efficiency  \nWe announced an agreement with Boeing and CFM International to buy 50 newly \nmanufactured Boeing 737 MAX aircraft powered by LEAP 1B engines and the option \nto purchase an additional 50 aircraft, with deliveries beginning late 2023. These jets \nare expected to burn up to 20% less fuel on a per passenger basis than our existing, \nused Airbus fleet while offering increased seating density. \nAdded measures we are taking to reduce fuel consumption include:\nEnsuring new aircraft are retrofitted with ACRO 6 seats,  \nwhich are lighter compared to those in our existing fleet.\nInstalling sharklets on eligible A320 aircraft new to our fleet,  \nwhich reduce the induced drag caused by lift\nPurchasing our new spare engines from original equipment  \nmanufacturers to include a performance package that helps  \nreduce fuel consumption by 1.5%.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALGT_2021.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
