Efforts from this \ncommittee resulted in several valuable \nfuel conservation solutions, including: \n\u2022   Route optimization \n\u2022   Single engine taxi in and out,  \nas time permits\n\u2022   Constant descent angle approach,  \nas permitted by air traffic \n\u2022   Flaps 3 for landing, an Airbus \ngreen procedure creating less \ndrag during the landing process, \nconditions\u00a0permitting \n\u2022   Idle thrust reverse for landing, \nconditions permitting \n\u2022   Auxiliary power unit fuel optimization \n\u2022   Data collection by aircraft to \nidentify performance deterioration \nand rectify issues in advance \nwhen\u00a0advisable  \u2022   Trial of certain electric ground \nhandling equipment \n\u2022   Optimization of the amount of \ncontingency and dispatch fuel\nThe committee is currently researching \nsustainable aviation fuel as a viable \noption on our routes.\nFuel-efficient flight planning system \nAllegiant\u2019s business model focuses \non providing access to affordable \ntravel for leisure travelers as opposed \nto corporate travel. This means we \nexpertly match our available capacity \nwith demand trends, providing only \nnonstop service from under-served \ncities to leisure destinations. This \npractice of flying less during off-\npeak seasons and off-peak days \nleads to higher load factors, which \nimproves fuel efficiency on a per \npassenger\u00a0basis. \nOn a flight-by-flight basis, when \npossible, we plan the most efficient \nroute and altitude to reduce our \nemissions. Because we fly into many smaller airports, our aircraft can \nperform idle descents easily into \nthese\u00a0airports. \nAs a result of our efforts, Allegiant has \nsignificantly improved fuel efficiency \nper aircraft across our previous \nand existing fleet. During 2021, we \nconsumed 205 million gallons of fuel averaging 85.4 available seat \nmiles (ASMs) per gallon of fuel, a 36% \nimprovement when compared to 2012. \nWe expect the new Boeing 737 \nMAX aircraft will perform with a \n19% reduction  in gallons per block \nhour and a 30% increase in ASMs \nper gallon over the current fleet.1150\n1050\n950\n850\n750\n650\n550\nJAN \n'15 JUL \n'15 JAN \n'16 JUL \n'16 JAN \n'17 JUL \n'17 JAN \n'18 JUL \n'18 JAN \n'19 JUL \n'19 JAN \n'20 JUL \n'20 JAN \n'21 FUEL EFFICIENCY (GAL/BH)737-8200 fuel burn\n737-7 fuel burn757\nA319\nA320\nMD80Fuel Efficiency Per Aircraft Type, Gallons Per Block Hour (2015-2021)", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALGT_2021.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
