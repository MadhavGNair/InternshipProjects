Support may \ncome in the form of payments \nfor mortgage or rent, utilities, \ncar payments or medical bills. Accident and Incident Mitigation\nWe believe all accidents and incidents are preventable. We have processes and policies in place to encourage disclosure, \nmanage hostile situations and identify potential risks:\n\u2022   Our voluntary disclosure program \nallows team members to submit \na report if they become aware of \nany violations or safety hazards \nencountered on the job, while being \nprotected from punitive action. This \nincludes the Aviation Safety Action \nProgram (ASAP), Aviation Safety \nReporting Systems (ASRS) and Safety \nEvent Report (SER). \u2022   Training  is crucial to prevent  \nand mitigate in-flight incidents. \nWe train our flight crew members \nto monitor the four threat levels \nranging from verbal altercation  \nto physical aggression, and how  \nto act when situations escalate. Our \nflight attendants receive training  \non de-escalation techniques.\u2022   Audits  take place regularly by \nindividual departments and our \nSafety and Security team. The FAA \nand the Department of Defense also \nconduct periodic independent audits. \n\u2022   Onsite base visits periodically \nconducted by our Quality Assurance \nteams help us proactively inspect and \nassess potential risks at our stations. \nIf an incident occurs, each operational \nsafety team manages their own \nincident investigation process to \nlook for root causes and contributing \nfactors. For major incidents, we deploy \nfield teams to gather additional data \nand deliver comprehensive briefs \nand\u00a0recommendations. 2021 Workforce Health and Safety Metrics\n2019 RATE 2020 RATE*2021 RATE\nTotal Recordable Incident Rate 3.61 4.39 3.47\nFatality Rate 0.00 0.00 0.00\nLost Time Incident Rate 3.57 1.91 3.43\n*COVID-19 cases increased recordable numbers.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALGT_2021.pdf", "page": 35, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
