We refurbish those \naircraft and use them for up to 15 years, \nwhich prolongs their lifespan without \nsacrificing safety. Of our existing fleet \nin 2021, more than 80% were acquired \nas used aircraft.  \nWhen it is time to retire our aircraft, \nwe recycle and reuse valuable parts. \nWe also purchase used parts in the \naviation marketplace. Recyclable commissary items  \nWe work with suppliers who use \nrecyclable materials in their products \nfor items available for purchase on \nboard flights.\nOur initiatives include: \n     Providing napkins made from \nrecycled materials, designated  \nas \u201ctree-free.\u201d \n     Exploring options for cups made \nfrom 100% recyclable materials \nand alternatives to plastic straws. Among the challenges we face in \nimplementing onboard recycling \nis the lack of storage space on \nthe aircraft and on the ground at \nmany of our smaller bases. We are \nworking on finding solutions to these \nrecycling\u00a0challenges.\n80%\nOf our existing fleet \nin 2021, more than \n80% were acquired \nas used aircraft.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALGT_2021.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
