We are growing our \nbusiness by adding nonstop routes \nflying out of more under-served cities \nto open up reasonably priced leisure \ntravel to more people in the U.S. We \nare committing to making Allegiant a \nleader in sustainability by promising \ntransparency and accountability as \nwe adhere to environment, social \nand governance (ESG) best practices. Most importantly, we plan to do this \nwithout compromising elements of our \nbusiness\u00a0model. Our vision of attaining \nESG excellence is grounded in the \nactions we have taken. We started by \ndeveloping an ESG strategy as part of a \ncomprehensive ESG program (see page \n8) in partnership with Schneider\u00a0Electric. \nTo keep us accountable and in the \ninterest of transparency, we will report \nannually on our ESG progress. I am proud \nto present our first report in which we \nbegin the process of disclosing data and \ninformation on our ESG efforts.

We made \nplans to be even more fuel efficient \nby agreeing to buy 50 new Boeing Presenting Our First ESG Report as Part of Our  \nCommitment to Sustainability  \n3 2021 Allegiant ESG Report", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALGT_2021.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
