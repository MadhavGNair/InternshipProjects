Changes in, among other things, morbidity, mortality, longevity trends and policyholder behavior could have a considerable impact on AEGON\u2019s income. AEGON believes it has the capacity to take on more underwriting risk (providing of course it is correctly priced) in line with the company\u2019s broader strategy to capitalize on growth opportunities in its main life insurance and pension markets. \nOperational risk \u2013 \n Like other companies, AEGON faces \nrisk resulting from operational failures or external \nevents, such as changes in regulations and natural or man-made disasters. AEGON\u2019s systems and processes are designed to support complex products and transactions and to avoid such issues as system failures, financial crime and breaches of security. AEGON is constantly working on analyses studying such operational risks and regularly develops contingency plans to deal with them. These plans also cover extreme event scenarios, such as the possibility of mortality pandemics in one or more of the company\u2019s main markets. \nReputational risk \u2013 As a result of the global financial \ncrisis\n, public trust in financial services companies \nundoubtedly weakened in 2008. During the second half of the year, AEGON took considerable steps to strengthen its capital position and ensure it continued to meet its obligations to customers, regulators and other stakeholders. Alongside this, AEGON also maintained a polic\ny of open and transparent financial communication, \nparticularly with regard to investors, customers and employees. In addition, the global financial crisis led to an increased focus on executive remuneration. AEGON\u2019s Remuneration Policy establishes a clear link between company performance and executive pay. Consequently, because of the significant decline last year in the company\u2019s overall financial performance, members of AEGON\u2019s Executive Board did not qualify for any performance-related pay for 2008. For further details of AEGON\u2019s Remuneration Policy, please refer to the Annual Report 2008, available online at www.aegon.com. \nRisk governance \nAEGON\u2019s risk management framework is represented acr\noss all levels of the organization. This ensures a \ncoherent and integrated approach to risk management throughout the company. Similarly, AEGON has in place a number of company-wide risk policies, designed to keep overall risk-specific exposures to a manageable level. \nAEGON\u2019s risk management governance structure has \nf\nour basic layers: \n\u0002The Supervisory Board (and the Supervisory Board \u0002\nRisk Committee); \n\u0002The Executive Board; \u0002\n\u0002AEGON\u2019s Group Risk and Capital Committee (GRCC); \u0002\n\u0002Individual Risk and Capital Committees (RCCs) present \u0002\nin AEGON\u2019s operating units. \nAEGON\u2019s Executive Board has overall responsibility for risk managemen\nt.
