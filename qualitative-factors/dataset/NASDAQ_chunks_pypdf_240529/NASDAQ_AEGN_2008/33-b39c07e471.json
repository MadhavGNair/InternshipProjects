{"page_content": "pension\tarrangements\tand\tother\tbenefits \nNaturally, pension arrangements vary from country to \ncountry. AEGON USA offers both defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit (DB) plans. In the United Kingdom, AEGON has now closed its DB plan to new entrants and offers only a DC plan. AEGON The Netherlands has a number of hybrid pension plans in place. In total, AEGON pension plans in its three main operating countries \u2013 the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom \u2013 cover approximately 55,000 employees and former employees. In addition, in Central & Eastern Europe, AEGON makes contributions to several employee pension funds and individual savings programs. Further details on AEGON\u2019s pension policies may be found in the company\u2019s Annual Report 2008, available online at www.aegon.com. \nabsentee\trates \nIn 2008, AEGON companies\u2019 overall absentee rate\n 1 stood \nat 2.5%, an improvement from 2.8% the previous year. This decrease was due mainly to lower absentee rates in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Most AEGON country units have policies in place to reduce absenteeism, including wellness programs, safety training and occupational health facilities. \nWork-related\tinjuries \nA total of 375 work-related injuries and illnesses were r\neported in 2008, up 17% from 320 the previous year. \nThis figure covers injuries sustained and reported by employees during the course of their work for the company. The increase is due to a rise in work-related injuries and illnesses in AEGON\u2019s main operating units and the inclusion for the first time of data from the Unirobe Mee\u00f9s Groep in the Netherlands. \nemployee\tsatisfaction \nOver the past year, AEGON has introduced measures to impr\nove levels of employee satisfaction. These include employee recognition programs and initiatives to \nstrengthen internal communications, including the launch in 2008 of a new company-wide magazine and a new intranet site dedicated to company employees. During the financial crisis, efforts were made to ensure employees were well informed both of AEGON\u2019s own position and of broader developments in world financial markets. These efforts included articles on AEGON\u2019s intranet site and in the company\u2019s internal magazines, as well as interviews with senior executives and letters sent directly to employees. In 2008, AEGON measured employee satisfaction at business units representing 87% of the company\u2019s total workforce. At these units, approximately 55% of employees were surveyed during the year. According to these surveys, employee satisfaction rose overall by 3.8% compared with 2007\n 2. \nIn 2008, AEGON also asked its country units to rate employee satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 100. On average, employee satisfaction levels were rated at 80, up from 77 in 2007. Toward the end of 2009 or early 2010, AEGON plans to carry out a company-wide satisfaction survey, covering its entire workforce. Results of this survey will be published in AEGON\u2019s Corporate Responsibility Report. \naeGon\u2019s\tcode\tof\tconduct \nAEGON\u2019s Code of Conduct sets out the company\u2019s core v\nalues and its underlying principles of business practice. \nIt applies to all AEGON employees (excluding only those working for joint ventures where AEGON does not have full management control).
