{"page_content": "OUR SHAREHOLDERS \nAEGON\u2019s international commitments \nAEGON upholds a number of different international a\ngreements that set out guidelines or minimum standards \nfor pollution, human rights or labor conditions. These agreements help shape and inform the company\u2019s investment decisions. \nAEGON also takes specific measures to detect and \npr\nevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist \nactivities. These include providing awareness training for all relevant staff and encouraging employees to report suspicious transactions both to management and to the responsible authorities. \nSocially responsible investments \nIn the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Hungary, AE\nGON offers Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) \nfunds. These funds invest in companies that adhere to ethically and environmentally sound business practices. Certain AEGON companies in the United States offer similar SRI funds managed by third parties. In China, AEGON Industrial Fund Management Company - AEGON\u2019s asset management joint venture - also oper\nates a succesful SRI fund. \nSRI funds typically avoid investing in certain sectors o\nf the economy, including armaments, tobacco and \ngambling. They may also exclude investments in companies that have, in the past, made political donations, have been fined for pollution offenses or operate in countries with poor human rights records. As well as \u2018negative screening\u2019, AEGON\u2019s SRI funds also focus on investing in companies that, in individual sectors, offer the best corporate responsibility records. Most assets in both the United Kingdom and the Ne\ntherlands are managed on behalf of policyholders. \nAEGON offers advice to its costumers about their investment in SRI funds. However, decisions on where to invest and how much to invest are taken by customers alone. AEGON cannot, therefore, determine the amounts invested in the company\u2019s SRI funds. \nAt the end of 2008, AEGON had six separate SRI funds \u2013 \nthr\nee in the United Kingdom, two in the Netherlands and \none in Hungary. \ncountry Funds \nAEGON UK Ethical Cautious Managed \nEthical Corporate Bond Ethical Equity Fund \nAEGON The Netherlands AEGON Duurzaam Aandelen Fonds (AEGON Sustainable Shares Fund) AEGON Sustainable World Equity Fund \nAEGON Hungary AEGON Climate Change Fund \nAt the end of 2008, AEGON\u2019s SRI funds in the \nUnited Kingdom, the Netherlands and Hungary totaled EUR 828 million, down 23% from EUR 1.08 billion the year before. The decline was due primarily to turmoil in world financial markets during the second half of the year.
