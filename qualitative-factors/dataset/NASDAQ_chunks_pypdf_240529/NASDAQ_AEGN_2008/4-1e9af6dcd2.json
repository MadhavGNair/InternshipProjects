{"page_content": "Letter from the CEO\n\ufffd\nDear Stakeholder, \nThis past year has been an extremely challenging one, both for \nAE\nGON and the insurance industry as a whole. The global financial \ncrisis has significantly changed the landscape for financial services companies internationally. \nAs such, customers more than ever need to know that \nthe companies they rely on to safeguard their financial needs will be there in the long term, that the products and services they provide will be simple and easy to understand, and also that those same companies are committed to using their resources in responsible and ethical ways. \nThis Corporate Responsibility Report \u2013 AEGON\u2019s sixth \nt\no date \u2013 details the policies and initiatives we are taking \nto safeguard the trust and confidence of our many stakeholders now and long into the future. \nThese days, companies are no longer judged by their \nf\ninancial performance alone. Increasingly, issues \npertaining to the environment, employee working conditions, corporate transparency, human rights, and investment practices also determine the reputation of a company, as well as its future prospects. Customers, employees, business partners and shareholders alike have a right to expect the highest standards in corporate governance and responsible community engagement. \nDespite the effects of the financial crisis, business has \nne\nver been more influential in affecting the economic \nand social conditions of people and communities. With this influence, of course, comes responsibility. That is why AEGON, as an international company, is supporting efforts to improve standards of financial literacy in its main markets. We want to ensure that people have the information and knowledge they need to make the right decisions for themselves and their families, particularly in today\u2019s complex and turbulent economic environment. That is why we are also implementing new company-wide principles for investment \u2013 so that people can be sure that AEGON\u2019s investments reflect not only financial considerations, but also our commitment to protecting the environment and upholding internationally-recognized human rights. It is also why we are introducing new initiatives to reduce AEGON\u2019s carbon footprint, and why we continue to support the fight against diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer internationally. The insurance industry plays a vital role in the global ec\nonomy \u2013 a role that is likely to expand in the coming \nyears, particularly as populations age and governments shift more responsibility for pension funding to the private sector. Millions of people in more than twenty markets around the world rely on AEGON to protect and secure their standard of living, especially after retirement. \nDuring the past year, we made further progress in \nadv\nancing AEGON\u2019s corporate responsibility practices \nin the Americas, Europe and Asia. At the same time, we recognize that there is much more to be done \u2013 something made even more urgent with the global f\ninancial crisis. \nWe welcome this opportunity to reassert AEGON\u2019s c\nommitment to making a valuable contribution to \nthe people and communities we serve, while pursuing a profitable and sustainable business for the benefit of all our stakeholders. \nThank you for your continued interest in AEGON. Sincerely, \nAlexander R. Wynaendts \nChairman of the Executive Board and CEO ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2008.pdf", "page": 4, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
