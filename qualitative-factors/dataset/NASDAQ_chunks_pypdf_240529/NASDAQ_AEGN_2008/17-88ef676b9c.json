{"page_content": "help\tfor\tdiabetes\tsufferers \nIn 2008, AEGON Czech Republic became \nthe first company in Europe to launch a \nlife insurance policy with supplementary \ncover specifically for diabetes sufferers. \nThe new policy gives diabetics the \nchance to insure against death and four \nserious illnesses prevalent among \ndiabetes sufferers: apoplexy, blindness, \nrenal failure and foot amputation. Until \nnow, the more than 700,000 people in \nthe Czech Republic who suffer from \ndiabetes have had little or no access to \nlife insurance. AEGON estimates that 2.3% of first-time pensioners did not receive \npayments due to them in 2008 because they had not updated their contact information, an improvement from 3.0% in 2007. Inevitably, some customers cannot be traced.

In all its markets around the world, AEGON operates either under its own name, a co-branded name or a local brand. In addition, AEGON regularly measures the performance of its brands, and tracks brand awareness at a country and operating unit level. \nAEGON is currently developing a more integrated approach to \nbr\nand management and a more clearly defined branding process. \nThe company does not expect this integrated approach to brand management to be in place in 2009.
