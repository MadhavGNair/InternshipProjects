{"page_content": "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that 2008 was a \ndifficult year, not only for AEGON, but for \nthe entire financial services industry. But \nI\u2019m confident we are taking the right \nsteps to deal with the crisis. We reduced \nour risk and we freed up capital from our \nexisting businesses. \nEven so, 2009 will inevitably be a \ndif\nficult year as well. All signs suggest \nwe\u2019re already in a deep economic \nrecession. These uncertainties mean \nthat liquidity and capital management \nwill continue to be a high priority in the \nnext year or two. \nToday\u2019s economic climate means that \npeople ha\nve begun to think differently \nabout their financial decisions and the \nsteps they need to take to safeguard \ntheir futures. Customers, for example, \nare already more sensitive to risk now \nthan they were six months ago. They \nwill want products that offer guarantees \n\u2013 products that, in an uncertain \nen\nvironment, will help them secure their \nlong-term financial futures, products \nthat are core to AEGON\u2019s business and \nexpertise. \nOver the past several months, we\u2019ve had \nt\no make some difficult choices. Among \nother things, we\u2019ve introduced a program of cost reductions in the United States, \nthe Netherlands and the United Kingdom that will save us at least EUR 150 million \nin 2009. Cutting costs is never easy, but it\u2019s something we have to do. In addition, \nmeasures to release capital and reduce risk will continue throughout 2009. \nFor a company like AEGON, there are \nopportunities opening up because of \nthe financial crisis \u2013 and these measures, \nby strengthening our financial position, \nwill help ensure we\u2019re able to capitalize \non them.\u201d \nJos Streppel \nCFO and member \nExecutive Board the\tglobal\tfinancial\tcrisis \nIn the second half of 2008, the global financial crisis led to a \nsignificant change in the business environment both for AEGON and for the insurance industry as a whole\n 1. \n\u0002\u0002There was a considerable deterioration in overall economic conditions, with many of the world\u2019s leading economies entering recession; \n\u0002\u0002Financial markets became increasingly unpredictable and volatile; \n\u0002\u0002Bond and equity values fell significantly; \n\u0002\u0002Interest rates also declined; \n\u0002\u0002Public trust in financial services companies weakened, while customers began to demand more products with guaranteed inc\nome; \n\u0002\u0002Regulators and rating agencies took a more conservative stance with regard to capital and solvency requirements. \nEven before the crisis, AEGON had taken a number of steps \nde\nsigned to position itself for a possible economic downturn. These \nsteps included:\n\ufffd\n\u0002\u0002Reducing the company\u2019s exposure to equity markets;\n\ufffd\n\u0002\u0002Structuring its investment portfolio more defensively;\n\ufffd\n\u0002\u0002Extending its hedging program and taking on more reinsurance;\n\ufffd\n\u0002\u0002Lowering financial guarantees on certain products;\n\ufffd\n\u0002\u0002Adopting a more integrated, international approach \nto risk management. \nThese steps helped strengthen AEGON\u2019s capital and liquidity po\nsition in the years immediately prior to the financial crisis. \nThe crisis itself, however, proved more severe than anticipated. To counter its effects, AEGON took further action in the second half of 2008. These measures were aimed primarily at: \n\u0002\u0002Further lowering risk and releasing capital from existing businesses; \n\u0002\u0002Reducing operating expenses; \n\u0002\u0002Developing contingency plans to protect the company against further declines in world financial markets. \nDuring the second half of 2008, AEGON made considerable pr\nogress toward these shorter-term priorities. \n\u0002\u0002A total of EUR 1.7 billion in capital was released from the company\u2019s existing businesses, mainly by reducing risk, taking on additional reinsurance and preserving existing capital. A further EUR 1.5 billion is expected to be released in 2009 through similar measures; \n1\t\ufffdFor further details on AEGON\u2019s response to the global financial crisis, \nplease refer to the Annual Report 2008, available on the company\u2019s website (www.aegon.com). \n6 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2008.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
