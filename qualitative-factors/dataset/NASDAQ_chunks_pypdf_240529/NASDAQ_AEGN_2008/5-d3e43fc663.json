But the \ncompany can trace its roots back much further \u2013 to the middle of the nineteenth century when its predecessors provided burial funds to customers in the Netherlands. Today, AEGON is an international business, providing life insurance, pensions and other long-term savings and investment products to millions of customers around the world. The company has major operations in the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, as well as other businesses in Asia, the Americas and elsewhere in Europe. With more than EUR 330 billion in revenue-generating investments at the end of 2008, AEGON companies employ approximately 31,500 people worldwide, serving some 40 million policyholders in over twenty countries across the globe. \nour\trole\tin\tthe\tglobal\teconomy \nAEGON believes that the insurance industry has a vital ec\nonomic and social role to play, protecting living \nstandards and helping ensure the long-term viability of pension systems around the world. In many countries, people are living longer, healthier lives. Workforces available to fund national pension systems are shrinking and governments are increasingly shifting responsibility for retirement financing to the individual and the private sector. In addition, longer life expectancy means that people are spending more time in retirement than ever before. As a result, for people in many countries, priorities are changing.

Of equal concern now is how to \nmanage those savings to meet the costs of old age and ensure a proper standard of living after 65. \nIn many countries, over-65s make up an increasingly significant part of the overall population. By 2050, according to the latest estimates from the United Nations, one in five Americans will be over the age of 65. In Western Europe, the figure is higher \u2013 more than one in four \u2013 while in Japan, by the middle of this century, over-65s will have reached close to 40% of the total population. \nThe phenomenon of aging populations is not confined to \nthe w\norld\u2019s developed economies. Estimates by the \nUnited Nations show that in China, for example, by 2050, almost 334 million people will be over the age of 65: more than the entire current population of the United States. In many emerging countries, recent economic growth has led to a rise in personal wealth and increasing demand for life insurance, private pensions and long-term investment products. In these countries, change has often been rapid. In India, where the population is still relatively young, the urban middle class has been expanding at a phenomenal rate. By 2010 according to a recent study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers\n 1, \nit could number more than 500 million people. In Central & Eastern Europe, since the collapse of communism, countries have pushed through ambitious economic reform programs. Over the next seven years, mandatory private pensions in the region are expected to attract some EUR 200 billion in investments\n 2. \n1 PriceWaterhouseCoopers: \u2018Entering the Indian Financial Services Market\u2019. \n2 Allianz: \u2018Pensions in Central & Eastern Europe\u2019. \n4 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2008.pdf", "page": 5, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
