These objectives are also contained in the company\u2019s business principles and its Code of Conduct\n 1. \nEach year, AEGON measures its consumption of energy and o\nther raw materials, most notably paper, as well as \nits production of waste and its emissions of carbon dioxide. In 2008, consumption of gas, electricity and water all rose, primarily as a result of an expansion in the company\u2019s businesses and an unusually cold winter in North America and Europe. Paper consumption was significantly lower, however. On a per capita basis, both electricity and paper \nconsumption fell. Gas use per employee, however, rose as a result of the cold winter. Water consumption showed a slight increase of 3.1%, or 2 liters per person per day. \nAEGON companies have policies and initiatives in place aimed at reducing energy consumption and making as much use as possible of renewable or recyclable sources.
