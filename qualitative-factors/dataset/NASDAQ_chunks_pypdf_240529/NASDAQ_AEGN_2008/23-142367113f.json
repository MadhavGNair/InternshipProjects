{"page_content": "Risk management in 2008 \nLike other insurance and financial services companies, \nAEGON experienced the impact of unprecedented deterioration in capital markets in 2008. The global financial crisis brought about sharp declines in equity markets, a worsening in general economic conditions, lower interest rates, extreme market volatility, an unprecedented widening in credit spreads and a sharp increase in bond defaults. These factors had serious implications not only for AEGON\u2019s sales and earnings, but also for the company\u2019s capital and liquidity position. AEGON regularly carries out sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of different scenarios (including extreme event scenarios), particularly on the company\u2019s earnings and capital position\n 1. During the year, AEGON \ntook a series of measures designed to counter the effects of the crisis and, where required, to limit the company\u2019s exposure to major financial risks\n 2: \nCredit risk \u2013 2008 saw an unprecedented widening in cr\nedit spreads, particularly in AEGON\u2019s US corporate \nbonds. This had significant implications for the value of the company\u2019s fixed income investments. AEGON\u2019s strong liquidity management, however, ensured that the company would not be a forced seller of such assets. \nEquity market and other investment risks \u2013 Equity \nmark\nets around the world fell sharply in 2008. AEGON \nhad already sold most of its direct equity market exposure in the Netherlands and the United States before financial markets began to decline. In addition, AEGON also increased the hedging of its product guarantees to protect itself against a further deterioration in equity markets. Interest rate risk \u2013 Interest rates declined in 2008. This had impor\ntant consequences, particularly for investment \nincome and for the margins on financial guarantees included in certain policies. On some products, AEGON took steps to reduce such guarantees. In addition, the company implemented an interest rate hedge in the Netherlands, reducing its exposure to interest rate volatility and the risk to earnings. In the United States, to achieve similar objectives, AEGON stepped up its forward-starting swaps program. \nCurrency risk \u2013 As an international company, AEGON is \ncle\narly exposed to movements in currency rates. \nHowever, AEGON does not consider this exposure to be material. The company holds its capital base in various currencies in amounts that correspond to the book value of individual country units, thus mitigating currency risk. On occasions, AEGON does however hedge cash flows from operating subsidiaries as part of its broader capital and liquidity management. \nLiquidity risk \u2013 AEGON has a strong liquidity \nmanagemen\nt strategy in place. The company\u2019s current \napproach to liquidity management dates back to the early 1990s. As part of this approach, AEGON regularly considers the most extreme liquidity stress scenarios, including the possibility of prolonged \u2018frozen\u2019 capital markets, an immediate and permanent rise in interest rates and policyholders withdrawing liabilities at the earliest conceivable date. In addition, the company has highly developed liquidity stress planning in place. In 2008, AEGON put its specially-designated Liquidity Stress Management Team into action to deal with the sharp deterioration in business and market conditions. Current tests show that available liquidity would more \nSupervisory Board \nRisk Committee \nExecutive Board \nGroup Risk and Capital Committee \nOperating unit Risk + Capital Committees \n1\t\ufffdFor further details on AEGON\u2019s risk management policies, strategies and governance, please refer to the company\u2019s Annual Report \n2008, available online at www.aegon.com. \n2 Please refer to page 6 for a discussion of AEGON\u2019s overall response to the global financial crisis. \n22 ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2008.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
