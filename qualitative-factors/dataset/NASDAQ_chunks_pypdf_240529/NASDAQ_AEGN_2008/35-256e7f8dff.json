{"page_content": "Our Business Partners \nIn 2008, AEGON paid out a \ntotal of EUR 1.64 billion to suppliers for a variety of goods and services, up just 1.8% from EUR 1.61 billion the year before. \nselection\tof\tsuppliers \nMany AEGON country units use locally-determined \nstandards as part of their selection process for suppliers. In the United Kingdom, these standards are an integral part of the company\u2019s procurement policy. AEGON The Netherlands, meanwhile, sets minimum standards for environmental criteria, as well as health and safety. In 2009, the company intends to establish similar minimum standards for its tender processes. In Taiwan, AEGON has introduced a 16-point guideline for suppliers, while minimum standards in Canada are in line with ISO 14001 \n1, an internationally recognized benchmark \nfor environmental management. In all, AEGON companies in the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Hungary all set pre-determined minimum standards for their suppliers. \nAs part of its objectives for 2008, AEGON has drafted \npr\noposals for company-wide corporate responsibility \nstandards for suppliers in its major procurement centers in Europe and North America. This is an important step toward ensuring high ethical standards through the c\nompany\u2019s supply chains. However, progress on these \nminimum standards has been slower than expected, due in part to the effects of the global financial crisis. Further work will take place with a view to finalizing these proposals during the course of 2009. \nstakeholder\tgroups \nAEGON country and business units maintain contact \nwith a wide v\nariety of stakeholder groups, either through \nregular meetings or through more formal structures \nsuch as works\u2019 councils or trade associations.
