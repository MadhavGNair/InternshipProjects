This principle is contained in AEGON\u2019s Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees around the world. Naturally, AEGON companies are also expected to comply with national legislation in this area, as well as other voluntary industry standards. In addition, AEGON takes initiatives at a country unit level to ensure the continued transparency of its financial products, particularly important during a time of economic stress and uncertainty. \nAEGON companies operate a \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 principle. This helps ensure customers get the right financial advice and are offered products tailored to their individual requirements. The policy also enables AEGON to detect errors and anomalies more quickly and helps in the fight against fraud and money laundering. \n1\t\ufffdPlease note that these figures exclude gains or losses on separate accounts and investment funds.
