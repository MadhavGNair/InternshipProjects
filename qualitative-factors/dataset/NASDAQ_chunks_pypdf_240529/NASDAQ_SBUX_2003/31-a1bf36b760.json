When a few thousand dollars is invested by Starbucks, and a \nfarm owner makes a contribution, it\u2019s amazing what happens. In fiscal 2003, Starbucks \ninvested more than $1 million in social programs that benefited farming communities \nin nine countries \u2013 from Colombia to Indonesia. Recognizing the challenges farmers \nand their families face, we focused our investments in two critical areas \u2013 health and \neducation.

Included in this category \u2013 Commitment to Origins,\u2122 as it is known at \nStarbucks \u2013 are certified coffees (organic and Fair Trade), and Conservation (shade-\ngrown) coffees. (See graph on next page for details about Starbucks purchases of \nthese coffees.)Coming Together to Build a School\nWhen one of Starbucks coffee \nsuppliers, Mr. Marcos Chavarria, \ndonated a parcel of land, the \nNicaraguan community of La \nReforma came together for a \ncommon purpose \u2013 to build a school. \nCash was needed for the project, \nso Starbucks contributed nearly \n$25,000. Parents offered their time \nto clean and prepare the lot for \nconstruction. And when the school \nwas completed, the Nicaraguan \nMinistry of Education provided a \nfull-time teacher. Today, the Las \nMarias School can accommodate \n120 school-aged children and 100 \nadult students, serving the residents \nof this small community located 35 \nkilometers northwest of Jinotega. \nApproximately 2.3 million pounds \n(1.04 million kilograms) of excellent \ncoffee are produced annually on \nsmall to medium-sized farms in \nLa Reforma. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SBUX_2003.pdf", "page": 31, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
