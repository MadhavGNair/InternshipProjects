We call it the \nStarbucks Experience.  \nFrom the beginning, we have upheld our principle of developing enthusiastically \nsatisfi  ed customers by assuming that everything matters,  especially the quality of \nour coffee and customer service. After every visit, our customers depart with a \nmemory of their experience. Our most loyal customers visit Starbucks 18 times a \nmonth on average. Therefore, our success depends on consistently providing our \ncustomers the optimal Starbucks Experience  every time they visit.\nBut it takes more to gain the trust of consumers these days. Most prefer to do \nbusiness with companies that demonstrate strong values and act responsibly. In this \nregard, we want our customers to know what Starbucks stands for and to hold us \naccountable if our actions appear out of line with our Guiding Principles.I", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SBUX_2003.pdf", "page": 40, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
