In fact, 78 % \nof our partners say our values provide meaningful direction in their jobs at Starbucks. \nAn entrepreneurial spirit permeates the atmosphere at Starbucks, adding to an environ -\nment that values every person\u2019s ideas and talents. It\u2019s customary not to capitalize \npartners\u2019 titles at Starbucks, which signals that everyone, regardless of their position, \ncontributes to the company\u2019s success. There is a significant focus on communication \nsystems designed to give everyone a voice, including Mission Review and the Standards \nof Business Conduct Helpline. Recognition is integral to Starbucks culture as is the \nnotion of helping each other, which is demonstrated through our internal CUP (Caring \nUnites Partners) Fund. \nM I S S I O N  R E V I E W\nAt Starbucks, being truly committed to our core values means holding one another \naccountable for our actions. Through Mission Review, partners are encouraged to \nvoice opinions about whether or not company practices are consistent with our Mission \nStatement and Guiding Principles. When our partners send their comments or questions \nto our Mission Review team, they are connected to the right person for a response. The \nprocess is monitored, and partners\u2019 concerns are shared with Starbucks leaders.
