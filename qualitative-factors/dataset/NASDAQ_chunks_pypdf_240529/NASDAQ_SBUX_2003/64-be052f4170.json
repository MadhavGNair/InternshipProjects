As we have reported, Starbucks is \ntaking significant measures to encourage the sustainable production of coffee.\nTea\nLike coffee, tea is an agricultural product. Tazo Tea Company, a wholly owned subsidiary \nof Starbucks, sources a variety of raw materials used in Tazo\u2019s tea blends, including tea \nleaves, botanicals and spices. Tazo is committed to purchasing certified organic materials \nfor its tea blends whenever feasible, appreciating that organic farming practices have \nenvironmental benefits because of the limited reliance on chemical fertilizers, herbicides \nand pesticides. (See tea sourcing graph, above left.)\nPaper\nStarbucks uses large quantities of paper \u2013 from the cups, napkins and shopping bags \nused in our stores, to the shipping cartons used in our operations. In an effort to reduce \nour environmental footprint, Starbucks strives to purchase paper with high levels of \npost-consumer fiber (PCF) and unbleached fiber. We believe our efforts will contribute to \nforest conservation and help to reduce waste. \nWe measure our performance in this area as the percentage of PCF content and, \nseparately, unbleached fiber that is contained in all the paper we purchase. In fiscal 2003, \nthe overall percentage of PCF content exceeded our goal of 20%, but compared to fiscal \n2002, our performance wasn\u2019t as strong. Over half of the paper we purchase is used in \nour hot cups. We are researching ways to incorporate PCF in our cups. Additionally, we \nare confident in our ability to raise the PCF content in future non-cup purchases, and \nhave targeted 30% PCF content.
