Dr. Robert Hrubes, senior vice \npresident of Scientific Certification \nSystems, believes independent, third-\nparty verification is the cornerstone of \na credible Corporate Social Respon -\nsibility program. \u201cBy establishing a \npreferred coffee suppliers program that \nincorporates independent verification \nagainst rigorous standards, Starbucks \nis demonstrating to its stakeholders a \ncommitment to social responsibility and \ntransparency,\u201d he stated.\nSo far, our coffee suppliers have \nengaged the following organic certifiers, \npublic agencies, and other certifica -\ntion entities to provide the verification \nwe require to be assured Starbucks \nCoffee Sourcing Guidelines are being \nimplemented:\n\u2022 Rainforest Alliance\n\u2022 MayaCert\n\u2022 British Standards Institute\n\u2022 Icafe/CICAFE (Costa Rica only)\n\u2022 Eco-Logica\n\u2022 NaturlandDuring our second year of the program, we visited Guatemala and Costa Rica and met \nwith producers, importers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and government \nrepresentatives to get feedback on the effectiveness of our Coffee Sourcing Guidelines. \nThe dialogue helped us identify regional best practices in order to make needed \nadjustments. So far, we\u2019re making progress at getting producers to adopt our guidelines.  \nOthers in the coffee industry are now developing sustainability models inspired by \nStarbucks Coffee Sourcing Guidelines. Unique to our program is that we require our \ncoffee suppliers to verify how much farmers actually receive of the purchase price. \nThis is extremely challenging because of the sheer number of farmers who contribute \nto Starbucks supply chain. Moreover, many small-holder farmers sell their crops to \nlocal mills or trade through cooperatives where formal records are not always kept. \nNevertheless, we are determined to gain transparency to ensure that a significant portion \nof the purchase price ends up in the hands of those who grow our beans.
