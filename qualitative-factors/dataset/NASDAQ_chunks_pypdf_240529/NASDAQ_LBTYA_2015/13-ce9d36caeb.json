So how do you keep a global network of over 27 million connected \ncustomers safe?\nLiberty Global\u2019s abuse management process has \nalways done exactly that. In 2015, we gave it a major upgrade. Partnering with the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit and global cybersecurity leader, Synopsys, we \nbuilt our own exclusive platform that allows us to \ndetect potential issues on customers\u2019 equipment and proactively contact them to take action.\nThis new global platform keeps customers safe \nby temporarily moving the affected customer into \na quarantine zone, prompting him or her to click \nthrough easy-to-follow remedies. Once completed, the customer\u2019s device is retested and released back into the full network.The results are impressive. Since \nlaunch in January 2015, we\u2019ve reduced malware infection rates by 25%, resulting in fewer reported issues, increased positive customer feedback and greater network stability .\nAnd we\u2019re not stopping there. In 2016, we plan to  \nrefine our data and information security programs  even further and aim to widen our focus to also  help business customers tackle the damaging effects \nof malware.\n3 http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/14/technology/security/cyber-attack-hacks-security/ \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2015.pdf", "page": 13, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
