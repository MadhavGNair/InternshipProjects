As part of a detailed \nprocess, we reviewed our industry peers and the media relevant to our sector, interviewed 11 sustainability experts, surveyed \n200 employees and more than 6,000 customers, and held consultation sessions with senior management. Our CR strategy continues to be shaped by their collective feedback.\nSee our full materiality matrix on our CR website.Our approach\nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nHere are just some of our stakeholder engagement highlights from 2015.
