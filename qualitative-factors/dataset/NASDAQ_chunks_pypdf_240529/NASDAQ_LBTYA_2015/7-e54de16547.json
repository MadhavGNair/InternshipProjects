{"page_content": "6\nDIGITAL \nIMAGINATION\nWHY IT MATTERS \nThe transformative power of the internet is found in every \ncorner of the world. It defines our generation, and is inspiring the next, in ways that we are only just beginning to imagine. That\u2019s why our vision for Digital Imagination is inspired by our \ndeep belief in the liberating potential of technology.\n \nOur goal is to take people \nfurther, to fuel imagination, and to empower us all to realize our potential. We will harness connectivity to teach future makers, spark positive change and accelerate innovation that brings benefits to communities and society .WHAT WE\u2019RE DOING\nOur new flagship program, Digital Imagination, is a collective \nmovement to create digital solutions that respond to pressing societal challenges. We focus on three main areas:\nFUTURE MAKERS\nWe are creating exciting ways to share the skills needed to thrive in the digital economy and create a positive social impact. For example, our work with coding club CoderDojo, the Big Digital Skills Hub, Get Online Week, Virgin Media \nPioneers, and Maturity in the Net.\nORIGINAL THINKERS\nWe are supporting and investing in innovators and \nentrepreneurs to use digital technology to inspire social change. For example, our work with  Virgin Media Accelerator in the UK and Telenet Kickstart in Belgium.\nCOLLECTIVE SOLUTIONS\nWe are bringing people together to use digital technology to solve the most pressing issues facing society. This is a new focus for us that we will develop further in 2016. One example is our Spark campaign, which sources responses \nto real business challenges by tapping into the collective \ncreativity of our employees.\nGRI: G4-EC8\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2015.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
