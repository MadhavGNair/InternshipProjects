{"page_content": "19Case study:  \nENGAGED EMPLOYEES DRIVING  \nA BETTER BUSINESS\nLiberty Global\u2019s success is built on attracting and retaining \nthe very best talent, so it\u2019s critical that we listen to our people. With over 37,000 employees in 14 markets representing more than 80 nationalities, the challenge is ensuring that \neveryone\u2019s voice gets heard.\nIn 2015 we launched Zoom, our new, global, employee \nsurvey. Zoom ensures consistency of feedback across all our operating regions. In the first year of Zoom, we achieved 85% employee participation, with 62% of respondents considering \nthemselves engaged, putting us well above the global \nbenchmarks of our independent surveyor, Aon.\nZoom also gives us outstanding\ninsight. We are proud that, across all of our locations, employees value our culture of inclusivity , openness and autonomy , and know that their views count. This is the empowered environment that we strive for.Of course, there are areas for us to work on too. Sometimes, \ncomplexity in our organizational structure and processes can slow us down and we see opportunities to improve talent attraction and retention. We also need to continue improving \nour focus on putting customers at the heart of our operations, \nresponding to their needs and adding value to them in all that we do. \nWe are currently working with 28 engagement experts across \nthe organization to embed these findings into our People \nAgenda. As we run action-planning workshops and support  \nall of our managers to use Zoom to identify and deliver targeted actions for their teams, we expect to demonstrate that listening to our people will help us improve our business for all. \nemployeesLISTENING TO\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2015.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
