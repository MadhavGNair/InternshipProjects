{"page_content": "8Case study:\nCODERDOJO: DEVELOPING OUR \nDIGITAL FUTURE\nCoderDojo is a global community of free coding clubs for \nyoung people aged seven to 17. As members of the European Commission\u2019s Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs, our passion for inspiring the next generation of technology leaders means \nwe\u2019re helping CoderDojo scale across Europe.\nIn 2015, Liberty Global staff helped us extend our partnership \neven further. CoderDojo Belgium worked with businesses, NGOs and local schools to organize a successful MegaDojo event for 10 to 14 year olds, attended by over 1,100 kids. More \nthan 40 Telenet employees volunteered to support the event, \nhelping young people learn basic coding techniques.\nIn September, at our Liberty Global Tech Summit\nAppathon in Amsterdam, we invited five of the brightestminds, all winners of the CoderDojo Coolest Projects  \nAwards, to demonstrate their projects alongside 100 \nprofessional developers.\nWe also trained over 200 of our employees in the Netherlands \nto lead coding sessions at another MegaDojo in February 2016. Hosted by our Dutch operation, Ziggo, the event saw our new mentors assisting in excess of 1,000 young people \nwith coding assignments.Conor\u2019s winning entry at the \nTech Summit Appathon was Quick Com, a communication aid that could have real impact on how DISABLED PEOPLE interact with digital devices.\nConor Begley is a perfect example of why Liberty Global \nhas worked with the CoderDojo Foundation since 2013. \nGRI: G4-EC8\nsuperpowersEMPOWERING\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2015.pdf", "page": 9, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
