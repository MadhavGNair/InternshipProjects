However, one of our companies, Ziggo in the \nNetherlands, has come up with a completely new solution to \nreducing our energy usage.\nEdge facilities (data centers connecting homes and businesses \nto the wider network) need a stable temperature to maintain peak performance. While higher demand leads to an \nincreasing number of edge facilities, we want to manage that \nexpansion in an environmentally responsible way.\nIn response, Ziggo built revolutionary phase-change material \n(PCM) into the fabric of new technical buildings. PCM keeps temperatures even by absorbing warmth from the air by day \nand then releasing it back during the cooler night. The result \nis that these sites use 40% less energy and zero refrigerants.\nZiggo already has 31 PCM sites, with more on the way, and  \nin 2016 we plan trials in other locations across Europe. \nEFFICIENCY\nEMPOWERED\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LBTYA_2015.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
