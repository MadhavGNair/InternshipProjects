The exercise was informed by tech-industry macro trends and the priorities stakeholders told us they thought were important. And, as with everything we do, our values served as a gut check that we were being true to who we are as a company. \nOpen company, \nno bullshit \nBe the change \nyou seek \nPlay, as a \nteam \nBuild with heart \nand balance \nDont #@!% \nthe customer \nBased on that exercise, here are the opportunities we\u2019re going after and risks we\u2019re managing: \nPLANET \nThe risk of not acting on climate change is simply too high for our business. Catastrophic climate change will deeply disrupt Atlassian, everyone connected to our business, and the global economy. \nCUSTOMERS \nWhen our customers use our products, they are trusting us to protect sensitive and confidential information. As a company that relies on customer trust and believes in privacy as a human right, we take this responsibility seriously, particularly as we move to the cloud. \nPEOPLE \nAn inclusive, equitable culture that allows innovation to thrive means that we are in a stronger position to attract and retain the talent needed to build products for all of our customers. \nCOMMUNITY \nWe\u2019re proud of the Atlassian Foundation\u2019s unwavering commitment to changing lives through education \u2013 which has become part of our brand identity and has contributed to high employee engagement for more than a decade. \nWhile our four pillars will likely remain the same over time, we\u2019ll continue to conduct regular materiality exercises and track emerging trends to identify new streams of work within these pillars. For instance, while we\u2019ve thought about our impact on the climate, we also have to think about how climate change might impact us. That\u2019s why, in fiscal year 2021, we will look at incorporat-ing climate-related financial risk in our Planet pillar. We\u2019ll refresh our materiality exercise in the next year or two to validate we\u2019re still on the right track.
