Some of our peers have really started to see positive change, so we know we can do better. \nDIVERSITY \nOver the course of the year, we hired 1,291 net new Atlassians, bringing our total to 4,907 employees globally (35% increase from fiscal year 2019). We received an average candidate experience Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 62. While we didn\u2019t move the needle in terms of representation as much as we would have liked, we piloted a few hiring practices that we think, once scaled, will increase the diversity of talent interviewing for roles on our team: \nWe continued to use Textio software \nto avoid gender-biased language and \nrepresentation on our Careers site \n(videos: #AtlassianWomen, Life at \nAtlassian, and Interns of Atlassian). \nWe piloted programs within our recruiting \nand sourcing efforts, including balanced \nslate (requiring candidates of underrepre -\nsented backgrounds to be part of each \ninterview slate), and developed sourcing \nlibraries to focus on top-of-funnel recruiting \nof candidates from under-represented \nbackgrounds. We formed strategic partnerships with \norganizations that focus on tech di -\nversity initiatives, including The Muse, \nWomen Who Code, People of Color in \nTech, Grace Hopper Celebration, Tech \nIntersections, Lesbians Who Tech, and \nCode2040 and attended tech-diversity -\nfocused events. \nWe entered into a par tnership with \nDisability Network Australia, which \nconducted a comprehensive audit of \nour current recruiting methods, tools, \nand processes, identifying ways we \ncan augment our inclusivity practices \nfor candidates with disabilities.
