Our approach to sustainability is inextricably tied to the future of our business and that long-term mindset \u2013 which helps us identify the emerging scenarios and blindspots that will become opportunities to seize and risks to mitigate. \nCompanies with strong sustainability strategies perform better over time, attract and retain talent, \nand deliver greater value to all stakeholders. Like any business, we believe that when our customers win again and again, our business benefits alongside them. And beyond our responsibility to bene-fiting our customers, we need a focus on our employees, our communities, and our planet that\u2019s just as strong. This is why we\u2019re as committed to sustainability as we are to our products. We think about it as embedding the goal of social and environmental progress in everything we do, and creating shared benefits that keep our business and those connected to it thriving. \nThere are a lot of ways we can invest time and money as a company. Across every initiative, we always have a long-term focus. Sustainability fits within that framework. We know that in 2, 5, 10 years (and beyond), we\u2019ll be able to see the impact on customers, our culture, and on society through our sustainability investments. It\u2019s the right long-term bet to make, full stop. \nSo, to verify we were working on the right things when we first built our sustainability strategy, we conducted a materiality exercise in partnership with corporate sustainability experts Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) \u2013 see the Appendix for details. While you\u2019ll see the outcome of that work in each of our focus areas, we also want to stay agile in our approach, which is why we also share risks and opportunities we project for the future.
