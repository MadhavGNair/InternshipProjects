This creates a challenge when we try to influence our upstream Scope 3 emissions. However, in support of our ambition to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner, we will be examining the Scope 3 emissions that occur in our supply chain and considering new emissions reduction strategies. \nIn terms of environmental compliance in our supply chain, we require that vendors sell us only products that comply with applicable laws, including those related to environmental protection and product safety, and we will not knowingly purchase products made in violation of established environmental or consumer product  safety requirements. \nAdditionally, we maintain a large supply chain with a broad \nnetwork of suppliers to give us flexibility in the event that any of our individual suppliers are impair\ned by climate-\nrelated issues. \nAdditional details are available in the \u201cConducting \nBusiness Ethically\u201d chapter of this report.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ROST_2021.pdf", "page": 45, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
