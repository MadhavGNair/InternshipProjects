It will define how we will engage strategically with our supply \nchain to empower and support impact measurements for energy, water and chemical use \nand set short, medium and long-term reduction targets in line with science. It will also \ndefine how we will support our suppliers in achieving these targets. This strategy will be \ncompleted by the end of 2020.\n3D Technology\nTechnology is a key part of our vision to manage and reduce our environmental impacts \nand we are already beginning to incorporate technological tools into manufacturing as well \nas design processes that minimize waste. In particular, manufacturing shoes at our scale \ngenerates significant waste in the form of samples.\nSome of our brands have already been experimenting with 3D printing of samples here in \nthe U.S., minimizing the expense and impact of manufacturing samples abroad and shipping \nthem to the U.S.  The Company has also invested in 3D drafting tools to further reduce waste \nas most samples are one-offs and typically end up in landfills.  As the technology improves \nand our customers come to expect 3D printed products and drawings for reviewing product \n- a process that is evolving as we speak - we are confident we will be able to cut down on \nsample waste significantly over the next two to three years.REDUCING WASTE\nCurrently, Steve Madden produces around 30,000 samples annually, of which only a small \npercentage are adopted.\n29\nSTEVE MADDEN \u2013 2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_SHOO_2019.pdf", "page": 28, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
