IATA estimates that \nthe investment required will be between $1 trillion and $1.4 trillion between now and 2050\n\uf07dAn increasing number of energy companies and airlines are making commitments to increase the production and use of SAF in their operations\n\uf07dHow will the industry get there? \n\uf07dAirlines : Investigate SAF opportunities through partnerships with \nother stakeholders, such as fuel suppliers and aircraft/engine \nmanufacturers. Begin SAF- enabled test flights, set targets for SAF \nusage and outline plans to meet these targets \n\uf07dGovernments : Clear policy support and incentives for SAF need to \ncome into force, ideally by 2025, to provide certainty to the sector, \nto help catalyze further investment in new production facilities\n\uf07dResearch Institutions : Continue to develop new pathways and \npartnerships to support new technologies for SAF production \n\uf07dEnergy Industry : Bring all this together to ensure SAF\u2019s \ncompetitiveness with conventional fuel\nLack of\nproduction\nCost (~2 -8x more \nexpensive)\nAvailability of \nfeedstocks\nLack of government \nsupport and \nregulatory \nincentives\nEngine investment \nto allow for >50% \nSAF usageChallenges ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AER_2021.pdf", "page": 46, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
