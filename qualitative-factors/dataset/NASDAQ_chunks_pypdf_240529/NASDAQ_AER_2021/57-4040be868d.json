The project involves the installation of solar cell modules, providing 63GWh of clean electricity to the Chinese Power Grid each year, enough to power ~47,000 households annually\n\uf07dThe second project is based in Brazil and is focused on forest protection through on- the-ground patrolling, strategic physical \noccupation of territory, improvement of forest management practices and encouraging sustainable use of forest products\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AER_2021.pdf", "page": 57, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
