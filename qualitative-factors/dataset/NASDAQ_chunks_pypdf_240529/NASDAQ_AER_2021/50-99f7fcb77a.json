However, as the \nworld\u2019s largest lessor, we feel a strong sense of responsibility to lead the industry towards a lower -carbon economy. Since 2014, we \nhave invested over $40 billion in purchasing and delivering new technology aircraft to our customers\n3\n\uf07dThis investment materially enhances the fuel efficiency of our customers\u2019 fleets reducing Scope 1 emissions for them, and Scope 3 emissions for AerCap. In addition, these aircraft also significantly reduce noise and air pollution.\n\uf07dWe have also supported the use of SAF in various flights; for example using SAF on a delivery flight for a brand new Airbus A320neo in December 2021\n\uf07dAs our strategic fleet transformation continues and we invest further in new technology fuel efficient aircraft, we should see \nfurther positive impacts ", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AER_2021.pdf", "page": 50, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
