{"page_content": "Spotlight Nylon innovation\nTaking the lead on biobased alternatives\nWith its performance, durability, and moisture-wicking qualities, nylon is the \nchoice for a lot of our products. In fact, it currently makes up the largest \nproportion of our fabric mix. It\u2019s also the most significant hurdle we face \nwhen it comes to achieving our sustainable materials goal.\nThere isn\u2019t enough recycled, post-industrial nylon for the uses we require, \nso to design new solutions we turned to Genomatica, a leader in biotech \ninnovation and materials. Genomatica has been successful at using \nbiotechnology and fermentation to turn naturally derived ingredients into \nthe building blocks for more sustainable materials, and to deliver these at \ncommercial scale. We are working together to bring renewably sourced, \nbiobased materials into our product lines, including lower-impact, plant-\nbased nylon. Our multi-year collaboration with them also includes our first \nequity investment in a sustainable materials company. \nThis partnership represents the next step in transitioning our nylon to high-\nperformance biomaterials and impacting over half of the synthetic materials \nwe use in our supply chain. It won\u2019t be easy. We recognize that there are \nchallenges and trade-offs that need to be addressed between carbon \nreduction, water, and land use. We will work with our suppliers to better \nunderstand these issues and champion lower-impact, more sustainable \nfarming practices that support workers\u2019 wellbeing.\n38\n LULULEMON IMPACT REPORT 2020 Introduction   Be Human   Be Well   Be Planet   Impact Supplement\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LULU_2020.pdf", "page": 37, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
