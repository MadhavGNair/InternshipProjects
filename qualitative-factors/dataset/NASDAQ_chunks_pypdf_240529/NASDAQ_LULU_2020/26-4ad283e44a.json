The path to wellbeing \nis possible when tools, support, and \nresources are\u00a0accessible to all. However, \ntoo often around the world barriers \npersist, making\u00a0access too difficult  \nfor far too\u00a0many people.This is especially true for those experiencing disproportionate \nrates of stress and trauma due to identity, ability, economic \nopportunity, and occupation. The lululemon Centre for Social \nImpact (the Centre) is setting out to break the barriers that \nprevent access to wellbeing, with a commitment of at least  \nUS $75 million over five years.\nWe will leverage our expertise, resources, and communities \nto invest in and advocate for the wellbeing of those most \nimpacted by systemic inequity around the world, guided by \nour\u00a0goal of impacting 10 million people by 2025.The Centre will identify and incubate emerging wellbeing \nsolutions and will partner with local and global organizations \ndriving progress in wellbeing.
