We honour and support the\u00a0wellbeing of Indigenous\u00a0communities. \nWe are committed to being a platform for amplifying Indigenous voices, \nand maintaining ongoing partnerships with First Nations organizations, \ncommunity members, and ambassadors. To approach this work \nmeaningfully, we engaged with The Circle on Philanthropy and Aboriginal \nPeoples in Canada (The Circle). The Circle describes itself as \u201can \nIndigenous-led organization working to mobilize settler philanthropic \ndollars to Indigenous-led projects, movements, organizations and nations. \nOur work contributes to positive change between the settler philanthropic \nsector and Indigenous communities by creating spaces of learning, \nrelationship building, co-creation, and activation.\u201d\nThe Circle guides us in contributing in meaningful ways. In 2020, with \ntheir guidance, we contributed CAD $1 million between the Musqueam, \nSquamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations, as well as the Urban Native Youth \nAssociation. As a full member of The Circle, we will continue to learn, grow, \nand honour these communities, establishing a\u00a0relationship of\u00a0reciprocity \nand respect. \nSpotlight \nClara John and Barry Dan opening the Here to Be Summit in Whistler, BC, Canada.\n30\n LULULEMON IMPACT REPORT 2020Introduction   Be Human   Be Well   Be Planet   Impact Supplement\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LULU_2020.pdf", "page": 29, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
