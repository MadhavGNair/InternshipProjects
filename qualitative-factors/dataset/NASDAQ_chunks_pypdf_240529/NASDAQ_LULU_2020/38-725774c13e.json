{"page_content": "Spotlight Mylo \u2122\nInnovating through nature\nWhen it comes to creating better products, sometimes the\u00a0answer \nis\u00a0right\u00a0beneath our feet. \nImagine a product that looks like leather and feels like leather, but is \ndesigned to avoid the negative impacts related to livestock. Enter Mylo, \nan innovative material made from\u00a0renewable mycelium, the root system \nof\u00a0mushrooms. \nAs with all our materials, we used life cycle assessments to measure the \nimpacts, considering carbon emissions, water, and chemical use. And, \nas with so much of our work, progress was made possible by working \ntogether with a committed community that shares our values. For Mylo, we \npartnered with Bolt Threads, a material solutions company that specializes \nin developing next-generation fibres, inventing and scaling cutting-edge \nmaterials inspired by nature. We\u2019re proud to be a founding member of the \nMylo Consortium, working together with other forward-thinking global \nbrands committed to a more sustainable future.\nIn 2022, we\u2019ll launch our Meditation and Yoga Mat Bag and Barrel Duffel \nBag, both of which feature Mylo in their handles and trims.\n39\n LULULEMON IMPACT REPORT 2020 Introduction   Be Human   Be Well   Be Planet   Impact Supplement\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LULU_2020.pdf", "page": 38, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
