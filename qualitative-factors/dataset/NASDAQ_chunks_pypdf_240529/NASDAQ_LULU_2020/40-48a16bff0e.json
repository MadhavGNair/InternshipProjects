Where possible, we sell any lightly damaged \nproducts externally through outlets or internally through  \nstaff sales. For\u00a0donations, we partner with Good360 and in \nsome markets,\u00a0donate products such as yoga mats directly  \nto community partners.\nDamaged and excess product38  \n(kg, \u2019000s)\n Recycled  188\n  Waste-to-energy Recovery 24\n Donated  17\n Resold  13Our product recycling partner, Debrand, recycles our apparel  \nto be used as home insulation, including stuffing for mattresses, \nfurniture, cars, and sporting equipment. Our yoga mats are \nrecycled into an equestrian footing product called ReitenRight. \nWhen we are unable to find recycling solutions, items are sent \nto a waste-to-energy facility that generates electricity. In 2020, we conducted a landscape assessment of international \ntextile recycling options to find recycling partners in local \nEurope, Asia, and Australia markets. We also continued to \ninvestigate opportunities for fibre-to-fibre textile recycling \nof blended materials. In 2021, we are piloting recycling with \nvendors in international markets. We will also initiate pilot \npartnerships to help advance blended-material recycling \ntechnology and broader recycling\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0solutions.\nCircularity and  \nnew guest models\nRecycled fibre for use as insulation.
