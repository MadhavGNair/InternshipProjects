{"page_content": "7Insights that emerged from the workshop include the importance of engaging more stakeholders from across the \nbusiness early in the design process, quantifying the return on investment of possible design changes, shifting \nfrom transactional toward service-based business models, and focusing on repairability. We\u2019ll use these insights \nas we develop the next generation of tools and features to support sustainable design across our products. \nThe manufacturing process itself also presents opportunities. Time, money, energy, and materials are often \nwasted due to poor design and inefficient production cycles, creating bottlenecks, machine idling, and slow \nproduct runs. Manufacturers can reduce energy use by up to 25% and increase productivity through smart and \nconnected manufacturing techniques.14\nThis past year, Autodesk\u00ae Fusion 360\u00ae software was enhanced with generative design for 2.5-axis manufacturing, \ncost estimating, and manufacturing extensions to help accelerate design decisions and improve the quality of \nproduction processes, which ultimately leads to less material waste and scrap.\nUtilizing automation to integrate design and manufacturing processes plays an essential role and helps designers \nand engineers achieve productivity boosts and deliver more sustainable products. The Autodesk\u00ae Product Design \n& Manufacturing Collection and our cloud platform help customers deliver on these objectives.\nAutodesk\u00ae CFD, Factory Design Utilities, Fusion 360\u00ae, Fusion Lifecycle, Inventor\u00ae, Moldflow\u00ae, Netfabb\u00ae, PowerMill\u00ae, \nand TruNest software\nMaterial efficiency and \ncircularity\u2022 Improve materials efficiency, create lighter products, and reduce waste with generative \ndesign and composites\n\u2022 Make greener materials choices\n\u2022 Conduct simulations to test and design more durable products\n\u2022 Nest pieces to optimize flat sheet cutting and reduce waste\n\u2022 Pack products and use support material efficiently to reduce waste in  \nadditive manufacturing\n\u2022 Improve print accuracy and success rate to decrease waste in additive manufacturing\n\u2022 Minimize waste by repairing parts with hybrid manufacturing\nEnergy efficiency and \nsmart manufacturing\u2022 Design and create energy-efficient electronics and machines\n\u2022 Reduce energy use and waste in production by optimizing machine use and  \ncooling cycles\n\u2022 Analyze and optimize factory building energy consumption\nResponsible supply chain \u2022 Audit suppliers to ensure product quality and compliance\n\u2022 Increase quality through failure analysis and reports\n\u2022 Comply with regulations with material and supplier declaration\n14.
