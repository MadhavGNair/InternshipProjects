Greenhouse gas emissions from business travel are included in Scope 3: \u201cBusiness travel.\u201d Emissions from facilities are included in Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3: \u201cWaste generated in operations\u201d and \u201cLeased assets.\u201d \nEmissions from data centers are included in Scope 2 (related to purchased electricity) and Scope 3: \u201cPurchased goods and services.\u201d Emissions from major conferences are included in Scope 3: \u201cPurchased goods and services.\u201d\n16. Autodesk University has been carbon neutral since fiscal year 2016; One Team Conference since fiscal year 2017.\n17. Data for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020 are calculated using the market-based accounting method, which takes into account purchased renewable energy and carbon offsets. Data for fiscal year 2009 uses a location-\nbased methodology to calculate GHG emissions.\n18. These data are calculated based on the economic input-output lifecycle assessment model, using industry-specific emissions factors in conjunction with Autodesk\u2019s spend.\n19. Data for \u201ccapital goods\u201d were calculated based on annual spend.\n20. Gold Standard certified carbon offsets were applied to Scope 3 business travel and major conferences.\n21. LEED certifications as of January 31, 2020, include facilities in Beijing, China; Mumbai, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; Milan, Italy; Singapore; Farnborough, United Kingdom; and the following in the United States: San Francisco, \nCalifornia; San Rafael, California; Boston, Massachusetts.\n22. Includes waste from major conferences and facilities. Data are extrapolated to our full real estate portfolio based on sites where data are available.Carbon footprint\nCommitments and targets: During fiscal year 2020, \nour absolute GHG emissions across our value chain \ndecreased by 3% compared with the prior year. Since \nfiscal year 2009 (our baseline), we have decreased \nabsolute GHG emissions by 43%, achieving our goal. \nMoving forward, our target is to achieve climate \nneutral GHG emissions for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 annually, \nbeginning fiscal year 2021. \nBusiness travel: We seek to reduce the GHG emissions \nof business travel through virtual meetings, partner \neducation, and a green rating system for hotels,  \nand by incorporating sustainability expectations into \nour standard meeting contracts.15\nFacilities: We assess our facilities\u2019 environmental \noperating practices related to energy use and other \nimpact areas and create customized sustainability \nimprovement plans. We also use our operations as \ntest cases to help refine the functionality of our \nsolutions, improve our environmental performance, \nand showcase how customers can use our solutions \nto meet their sustainability objectives.15\nCarbon-neutral cloud: In addition to using 100% \nrenewable energy for our cloud services, we strive  \nto minimize data center energy use through server \nvirtualization, selection of efficient equipment that \nmeets respected industry standards, and by \nstreamlining our code. These efforts help us provide \ncustomers a faster, more reliable experience, with \nreduced environmental impacts.15\nMajor conferences: Autodesk University and One Team \nConference (our annual channel partner and sales \nsummit) are both carbon neutral, including the events \nand attendee travel.16 We achieve this by enhancing \nefficiency, providing virtual attendance options, \nreducing waste, and purchasing carbon offsets.15(Baseline)\nPerformance data FY2009 FY2019 FY2020\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [metric tons CO2e] (market-based) 301,000 178,000 172,000 \nC-FACT carbon intensity ratio [metric tons CO2e/relative contribution to world GDP] 9.12 6.28 4.70 \nGHG emissions intensity [metric tons CO2e/million US$ revenue] 130 69.2 52.5 \nGHG emissions intensity [metric tons CO2e/employee] 38.7 18.5 17.0 \nGHG emissions intensity [metric tons CO2e/1,000 active square feet] 167 81.2 75.0 \nScope 1: Direct emissions from owned/controlled operations [metric tons CO2e] 4,250 2,650 3,190 \nScope 2: Indirect emissions from the use of purchased electricity, steam, heating, \nand cooling (including renewables)17 [metric tons CO2e]18,100 72 101 \nScope 3: Upstream [metric tons CO2e] 278,000 175,000 169,000 \nPurchased goods and services18 132,000 105,000 105,000 \nCapital goods18, 19 25,000 23,200 25,300 \nFuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2) 4,180 3,850 4,330 \nTransportation and distribution1819,400 7,940 5,250 \nWaste generated in operations 1,080 684 411 \nBusiness travel1877,300 21,600 14,200 \nEmployee commuting 19,000 13,100 14,400 \nLeased assets18249 20.9 67.2 \nScope 3: Downstream [metric tons CO2e] 1,000 9.18 3.98 \nTransportation and distribution 898 7.18 3.09 \nEnd-of-life treatment of sold products 104 2.00 0.893 \nEnergy use [MWh] 53,200 57,800 58,900 \nDirect energy use 11,700 1,770 2,310 \nIndirect energy use 41,500 56,000 56,600 \nRenewable energy [as a percent of total indirect energy use] 4.91% 99.1% 98.1% \nCarbon offset from renewable energy [metric tons CO2e] 752 23,500 22,000 \nCarbon offset from other projects [metric tons CO2e]200 71,300 69,000 \nCarbon offsets [as a percent of total GHG emissions] 0.271% 53.3% 34.6% \nLEED certifications212 15 15 \nBuildings with LEED certification [as a percent of total active square footage] 1% 31% 27% \nWaste generation [metric tons]22-- 9,150 6,570 \nLandfill diversion rate [percent] -- 43% 53% \nEnvironmental violations and fines [US$] 0/$0 0/$0 0/$0", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ADSK_2020.pdf", "page": 8, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
