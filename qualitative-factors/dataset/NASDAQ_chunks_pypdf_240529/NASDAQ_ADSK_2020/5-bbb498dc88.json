{"page_content": "6Using data science to reduce construction risk and waste\nIn 2019, Autodesk launched the Construction IQ Preview, a software program that uses machine learning to \nimprove construction practices and outcomes. Our algorithms and models enhance design reviews, helping \nto reduce rework and waste, detect high-risk defects like water penetration risk early, and analyze unsafe \nbehaviors and safety hazards in construction, which is consistently one of the most hazardous industry \nsectors. By analyzing data such as issues, observations, checklists, subcontractor assignments, and \nhistorical data from across Autodesk\u2019s construction management platform, Construction IQ identifies \nhigh-risk issues during design reviews and construction and finds patterns of unsafe behavior that increase \nrisk for fatal injuries on a jobsite. The algorithms were trained using more than 150 million data points \ngleaned from nearly 30,000 real projects. In March 2020, based on this innovation, Autodesk was rated #5 \non Fast Company\u2019s list of the most innovative data science companies of 2020 .\nAutodesk\u00ae AutoCAD\u00ae, CAMductTM, CFD, Civil 3D\u00ae, Formit\u00ae, FormIt\u00ae Pro, , InfraWorks\u00ae, Insight, Navisworks\u00ae, ReCapTM, \nRevit\u00ae, Robot Structural Analysis Professional, and Autodesk Construction Cloud software\nBuilding design and \nengineering\u2022 Design high-performance buildings\n\u2022 Conduct energy analysis from concept to complex modeling\n\u2022 Optimize HVAC system design\n\u2022 Use clash detection during design to reduce waste in construction\n\u2022 Reduce embodied carbon through design and material specification\n\u2022 Plan for smart decommissioning and materials recovery\n\u2022 Improve structural material efficiency\nInfrastructure \u2022 Plan and design infrastructure for resilience and adaptation to climate change\n\u2022 Visualize projects in the context of the surrounding built and natural conditions\n\u2022 Perform simulations to assess environmental and social impacts of designs\n\u2022 Conduct traffic flow and mobility impact studies\n\u2022 Optimize inland and coastal flooding projects\n\u2022 Manage bioretention and green stormwater infrastructure\nConstruction \u2022 Reduce embodied carbon through low-carbon material procurement\n\u2022 Support lean production planning and execution to reduce waste and streamline schedule\n\u2022 Improve site safety\n\u2022 Modularize design and maximize prefabrication\n\u2022 Minimize scrap in fabrication\n\u2022 Increase precision to maximize built performanceProduct design and manufacturing (D&M): Consumer \ndemand for more environmentally friendly products, \nas well as new environmental regulations, pushes \nmanufacturers to commit to sustainable and circular \noutcomes in their work. In a 2018 survey of senior \nexecutives from large corporations around the world, \n30% said their company had a circular economy \nstrategy, and over three-quarters plan on adopting \ntargets to make their products, processes, or business \nmodels more circular in the coming five years.12\nA study of Autodesk\u2019s design and manufacturing \ncustomers showed that approximately 52% have \ncommitments to implementing sustainable practices.13 \nTo address sustainability challenges and meet their \ncommitments, Autodesk customers are implementing \nsmarter and more efficient design and manufacturing \napproaches, increasing materials productivity, \ndeveloping more circular business models, reducing \nenergy use, and enhancing supply chain responsibility.\nTo better understand how these trends apply to our \ncustomers, in 2019 Autodesk and IDEO led a workshop \nwith approximately 20 designers, manufacturers, and \nconsultants to explore what process changes and tools \ncould better support sustainable product design. \nThe \u201cA.I. Chair,\u201d the first chair created in partnership between humans \nand artificial intelligence, resulted from a conversation between \nPhilippe Starck, Kartell, and Autodesk. Launched in 2019 and made \nusing 100% recycled material, it was developed using generative \ndesign, a form of artificial intelligence that uses the power of the \ncloud to create better outcomes for products, buildings, infrastructure, \nsystems, and experiences. This technology offers great potential for \nsustainable design through optimization (and reduction) of materials \nuse, energy consumption, and other dimensions. 12.
