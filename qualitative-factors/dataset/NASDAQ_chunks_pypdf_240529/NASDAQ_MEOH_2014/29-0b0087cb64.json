This includes training on safe methanol handling and nitrogen awareness/nitrogen asphyxiation risks. To ensure compliance with all regulations and best practices, all ocean-going ships are required to complete an annual inspection based on the Chemical Distribution Institute\u2019s  Marine (CDI-Marine) protocol.\nOur internal Safety Visit Program, conducted \nannually on all ships, is a review of 23 areas of on-board safety management and people practices (e.g., crew morale, motivation, leadership, safety culture). Results of this review help ship management companies improve their safety and environmental systems, and provide us with a benchmark of safety practices. Our in-region barge operations are not owned or operated by Waterfront Shipping. However, all contracted companies have successfully passed our safety assessment protocol to enhance their Responsible Care performance when transporting methanol along inland rivers.\nTerminals\nContracted terminals, used to store our methanol, \nare requested by Methanex to undergo Chemical Distribution Institute\u2019s Terminal (CDI-Terminal) inspections by a third-party inspector every three years. This includes essential aspects of safety and environmental protection. Following these inspections, we work with the terminals to  \nprioritize deficiencies for improvement. Other delivery locations that are not contracted by Methanex are also encouraged to participate  in CDI-Terminal inspections. \nRoad and Rail Safety \nIn Canada, Methanex follows an initiative led by \nthe Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC) called the Transportation Emergency Assistance Program (TEAP III).
