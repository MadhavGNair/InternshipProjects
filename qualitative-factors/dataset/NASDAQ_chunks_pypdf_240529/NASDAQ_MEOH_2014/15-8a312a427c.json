The overall observation rate continues to be healthy across the organization, with a rate of 1.10 for 2014. We consider a target of 0.70 a minimum for an effective behavioural observation program, and a rate of 1.40 to be a highly effective program. An observation rate serves as a general indicator only. To maximize the program\u2019s benefits, a full range of internal tools are applied at the regional level to ensure quality observations, data review, and the development  of safe behaviour actions.\nHuman Factors\nIn addition to our BBS Program, we continue to \nimplement a human factors approach to further improve our safety culture. This approach is in line with the views of the World Health Organization: \u201cA simple way to view human factors is to think about three aspects: the job, the individual and the organization and how they impact people\u2019s health and safety-related behaviour.\u201d Our approach incorporates other elements into each of these three aspects:\nIn 2015, we will continue implementing human \nfactors across manufacturing sites by: \n\u2022 Conducting a Safety Culture Maturity Model survey\n\u2022 Establishing a Health & Safety Behavioural Standard \n\u2022 Developing a Human Factors Analysis Technique (HFAT) for incident analysis\nSafe Days Program Benefits  Local Charities\nIn 2013, to inspire others to commit to our principles of Responsible Care, we started a Safe Days Program during major refurbishments at our Motunui production plant in New Zealand. For each day without an injury or safety process incident resulting in lost time, Methanex gave $150 USD to one of four nominated charities. In 2014, there were 161 Safe Days out of 165 project days. The program was so successful that in 2014, we continued the Safe Days Program across all of our New Zealand locations, helping inspire personal ownership for safety, and bringing the community, employees and contractors together. In 2015, we plan to expand the Safe Days Program to other Methanex facilities during major plant refurbishments and maintenance projects.\nJOB \ntask, workload, \nenvironment, display  \n& controls,  \nproceduresORGANIZATION  \nculture, leadership, \nresources, work patterns, communicationsINDIVIDUAL  \ncompetence,  \nskills, personality,  \nattitudes, risk \nperception", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2014.pdf", "page": 15, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
