We also conduct routine plant maintenance and inspections, and undergo process safety management programs. (See Workplace section, page 14, for more on Process Safety Management.) In addition, in the event of a large spill, we have crisis and emergency response teams in place to mitigate any health, safety and environmental impacts. \nA key aspect of our spill preparedness and \nresponse program is ensuring that local response organizations are prepared to handle a methanol-related transportation incident. In Canada and the U.S., we follow the CIAC-led initiative TRANSCAER\u00ae (Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response), a voluntary chemical industry initiative that focuses on assisting communities to prepare for and respond to  \npossible hazardous materials transportation incidents. We will be implementing TRANSCAER  in our other regions as well.\nWe also work closely with our Community  \nAdvisory Panels (see the Community chapter) \nto ensure community concerns about potential methanol incidents are addressed.\nHOW WE ARE DOING\nIn 2014, we had zero reportable (i.e., serious or major) spills. This is a significant improvement over 2013, when we had four reportable spills. We achieved this by thoroughly investigating the incidents that occurred in 2013, identifying what changes needed to happen and taking  \npreventative action.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2014.pdf", "page": 27, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
