Competence Assurance is a controlled, evidence-based process to ensure that people have the skills and knowledge they need to do their jobs safely and effectively.\nThe project\u2019s overarching goals are to connect \nlearning and development with workplace needs through competency-based training. By developing a system that helps define the competencies required for specific roles as well as the knowledge and capability components needed to ensure ongoing quality assurance, we can deliver high-calibre training programs for our next generation of leaders. The program will be rolled out in stages, beginning in 2015.Global Employee Statistics in 2014\nEight Years of Responsible Care\n\u00ae in Trinidad \nSince starting our operations in Trinidad eight years ago, we\u2019ve made \nsignificant efforts to firmly establish our Responsible Care culture on the local landscape, through both workplace practices and community impact.
