{"page_content": "2014 Responsible Care and Sustainability Report \u2003\u200323\nProtecting Local Environments\nNew Zealand Native Forest Habitats\nMethanex staff are working with the Taranaki \nRegional Council (TRC) to enhance a two-hectare area of native forest that contains regionally significant ecosystems, habitats and species. In 2014, upon the completion of an ecological assessment, we began implementing a predator control program, along with the building of a stock-proof fence to protect the Methanex-owned land. We are also working with the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust in New Zealand to place a covenant on the land, to provide legal protection and recognition of the area.\n Sharing Responsible Care\n\u00ae Values with Communities in China\nTo mark World Environment Day (June 5, 2014), Methanex staff in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong \nteamed up with other members of the Association of International Chemical Manufacturers (AICM) to share Responsible Care values with the public. This half-day event, which was held in the Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone, was attended by more than 200 people, including local high school students and representatives of environmental groups and government agencies. Employees created a variety of games and activities to engage people in learning about methanol production and logistics, and to discover how methanol is increasingly being used as an alternate clean energy transportation fuel. During the session, participants posted their thoughts about Responsible Care on a colourful board. Their heartfelt comments showed they clearly understood the values of Responsible Care \u2014  \nof always doing the right thing and putting our values and safety practices into action every day.\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MEOH_2014.pdf", "page": 22, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
