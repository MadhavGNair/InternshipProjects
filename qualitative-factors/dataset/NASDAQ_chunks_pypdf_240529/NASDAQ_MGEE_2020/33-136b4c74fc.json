The board holds \ns\ntrategic planning and review sessions with all  \nofficers periodically.Effective oversight \nDirectors understand corporate responsibility and sustainability are integral to the company\u2019s long-term success and share management\u2019s commitments in these areas, from long-term and strategic direction to day-to-day business practices companywide. Each director is expected to examine all major issues affecting an organization and must be committed  \nto the highest ethical standards, accountability, tr\nansparency and open dialogue with one another  \nand with management to provide effective oversight.\nThe bo\nard has four standing committees.
