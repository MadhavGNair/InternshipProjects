Man-ma\nde nesting boxes at power plants have \nproven ideal homes for the birds of prey, which are an endangered species in Wisconsin. The use of DDT pesticide beginning in the 1940s eradicated them.\nFalcons were reintroduced to Wisconsin in the 1980s,  \nand while they are listed as endangered in Wisconsin, \nthe\ny have made a slow, steady comeback due to \nstatewide efforts and nesting boxes like the one at Blount. The original nesting box at Blount was installed in 1999. It was built by an MGE employee and his son. In fall 2018, due to renovations at Blount, employees built a new falcon box and moved it to a new location at the plant, which the falcons began using for nesting in 2019.\nMGE has seen 46 falcons hatch at Blount, including the \n2020 chicks. Falcon expert Greg Septon visits Blount every spring for our naming ceremony during which the chicks also are banded for tracking throughout their lifetimes.
