{"page_content": "ALTRA EH&S RISK  \nMITIGATION SYSTEM\nAltra 2021 Sustainability Report  /   TEAMWORK    /  28Measuring EH&S Performance \nTo measure performance, we track our \nTRIR, DART rate, lost time rate and incident \ntypes at sites worldwide. In 2021, 29% of our \nmanufacturing sites achieved zero recordable \ninjuries, an improvement from 27% in 2020. \nThrough our focus on safety culture, risk \nidentification and reduction and ergonomics \nwe aim to drive continuous improvement across \nEH&S globally. EH&S Risk Mitigation System\nIn 2022, Altra will launch its EH&S Risk Mitigation \nSystem. This system will be an Altra standard \nprocess comprised of EH&S performance \ncriteria organized into 4 major risk categories: \n1. Operational \n2. System \n3. Regulatory\n4. EH&S Metrics\nThis system will drive EH&S risk reductions \nacross all Altra facilities. Further, it will utilize \nsustainability criteria and metrics to evaluate \nthe sustainability performance of each A Commitment to Continuous  \nImprovement in EH&S\nAltra is focused on driving reductions in \nour incident rate and improving our work \nenvironment. Each location sets an annual \nimprovement target that is then aggregated. \nWe are committed to improving our \nperformance year-over-year and our facilities \ncommit to an annual site-specific performance \nimprovement target to ensure continuous \nimprovement across Altra. \nOur facilites commit \nto an annual site-specific \nperformance improvement \ntarget to ensure continuous \nimprovement across Altra.\noperating company. These sustainability \nmetrics include;\nA.  Water and energy efficiency; \nB. Waste minimization;\nC. Emissions reduction; and\nD. Renewable energy project initiatives. \nThe EH&S Risk Mitigation System will provide a  \nfeedback mechanism for Altra businesses to \ndrive continuous improvement. Lastly, the \nEH&S Risk Mitigation System will be informed \nby ISO 45001 and ISO 14001, setting the \nfoundation for additional facilities to maintain \nand pursue ISO certifications.
