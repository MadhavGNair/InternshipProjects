{"page_content": "Altra 2021 Sustainability Report  /   ENVIRONMENT    /  19We recognize our impact on the \nenvironment is complex and that we \nhave a responsibility to deliver value  \nto our stakeholders and communities  \nby reducing our greenhouse gas \n(\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. \nWe are committed to applying ABS principles \nand strategies to drive continuous improvement \nin tracking, analysis and reduction of GHG \nemissions and energy consumption across our \nglobal footprint.\nEnergy Management System \nAltra encourages all facilities to implement \nenergy management systems aligned with \nISO 50001. In Germany, three Altra sites are \ncertified and in compliance with ISO 50001. \nAdditionally, other sites like Portescap Mumbai \nhave worked to reduce energy consumption by \nutilizing efficient air conditioning, optimizing \ncompressed air consumption, and replacing \ncoil-based fans with brushless DC fans. Our sites in Germany and \nour Portescap facility \nin Mumbai demonstrate \nthe positive impact that  \nenergy management systems \ncan have on operations. \nIdentifying Climate Related \nRisks\u00a0&\u00a0Opportunities\nThe Nominating and Governance \nCommittee of our Board of Directors \nis responsible for ESG risk oversight. \nWe conduct an annual Enterprise Risk \nAssessment that seeks to identify and \nprioritize risks to Altra and our businesses\u2014\nincluding ESG-related risks\u2014and highlights the \nimpact each specific risk could potentially have \non our business as a whole. As our operating \ncompanies go through their annual strategic \nplanning process, they evaluate the impact \nthat broader trends, such as alternative energy \nand enhanced energy management, may have \non their business and adapt and adjust their \nstrategies accordingly.GHG EMISSIONS & ENERGY MANAGEMENTEnergy Reduction\nAltra\u2019s operating companies implement \nglobal energy management reduction \nstrategies across the organization to help \nreduce our overall impact.\nTwiflex (UK)\nOur Twiflex team installed higher efficiency \ninsulation material, replaced traditional lighting \nwith LED lights with timers, and trained staff \nabout responsible energy use. Twiflex\u2019s energy \nmanagement initiatives earned Level 1 Green \nMark certification in the UK.\nAltra India (Pune)\nOur Altra India facility has been running on  \nsolar power since March 2021. The installation  of solar panels is projected to reduce  \nenergy costs by 15% and CO2 emissions by  \n15 tons on an annual basis.\nWarner Electric (France)\nThe Warner Electric team reuses the heat \ngenerated and emitted from factory floor \ncompressors to supplement traditional  \nheat systems in their facilities, resulting in \nreduced energy consumption.\nStromag \nSince 2015, Stromag has provided more  \nthan 200 commuter bikes to Altra team \nmembers and their families.\nA Commitment to Continuous  \nImprovement and Transparency\nWe believe transparency is a critical component \nof an effective corporate environmental \nstrategy. Although we are in the early stages of \nestablishing more robust data collection and \nreporting capabilities, we are committed to SUSTAINABILITY  \nIN MOTION   Examples of  \nour impact\nimplementing new processes and standards \nto compile and assess critical GHG emissions \ndata from across our businesses. As a first step \nin this journey, we are working to implement a \ntool that will collect emissions data throughout \nour organization so we can better understand \nenergy consumed globally by Altra.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AIMC_2021.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
