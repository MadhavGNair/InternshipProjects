This includes implementing waste minimization \nstrategies and tools across the organization \nthat emphasize monitoring, reduction, \nreuse, recycling, and responsible disposal to \ndeliver exceptional value to our stakeholders, \ncommunities and society.\nUnder the leadership of our Environmental \nHealth & Safety (\u201cEH&S\u201d) Director, we \ncontinuously work to improve our waste \nminimization strategy. For example, we are \nimplementing a global data collection tool  \nthat will enable us to better understand  \ncurrent-state waste generation, recycling and \ndisposal practices across all Altra businesses. \nThis enhanced data will allow us to identify  \nand pursue opportunities to further improve \nwaste management.ISO 14001 Certification\nCurrently, 15 Altra facilities are ISO 14001 \nCertified, meaning they satisfy an international \nstandard specifying requirements for an effective \nenvironmental management system. Maintaining \nthis certification ensures focus on specific \napproaches such as audits, communications, \nlabelling and life cycle analysis to help meet \nenvironmental challenges.Altra systematically \napplies ABS throughout \noperations to increase \nenvironmental awareness, \nreduce impact, minimize \nwaste and strengthen \nprocesses going forward.15\nAltra facilities  \nare ISO 14001 Certified", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AIMC_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
