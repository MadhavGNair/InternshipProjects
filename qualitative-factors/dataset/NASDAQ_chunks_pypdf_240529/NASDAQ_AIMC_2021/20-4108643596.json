{"page_content": "Altra 2021 Sustainability Report  /   ENVIRONMENT    /  20\nResponsible Water Stewardship\nAltra is mindful of its global presence and the \nhigh baseline water-stress in certain geographic \nregions. Recognizing water is a valuable \nand limited resource, several Altra facilities \nhave taken steps to reduce wastewater and \nconsumption. These initiatives include the \ninstallation of automatic water stops, aerated \nspray tools, dual flush toilets and sensor \noperated sinks, among others. As part of our \nsustainability strategy, Altra is committed to \nfurther expanding our role in global water \nconservation over the coming years. Of \nthose facilities with the capability to measure \nwastewater discharge, approximately 82% \nclosely monitor and track wastewater discharge.Altra\u2019s Future in Water Management\nAltra recognizes that its actions impact water \nwithdrawal, consumption and discharge. We \nare enhancing our comprehensive data \ncollection processes to improve our water \nstewardship. By gathering data across \nour manufacturing facilities Altra will \nbe able to track water withdrawal \nglobally. With a more complete \nunderstanding of our baseline, \nAltra will be better positioned \nto establish goals and \nimplement purposeful \nstrategies to further \nreduce our impact on \nwater resources. WATER & WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT\nWater Stewardship\nPortescap Doha Watershed  \nManagement Project\nRecognizing water-stress and scarcity within \nIndia and particularly the impact to rural \nfarming, Altra\u2019s operations have supported \nthe Watershed Management Project \nthrough Portescap\u2019s partnership with a non-\ngovernmental organization dedicated to \nrural development.  Portescap has devoted \nresources to assist with a significant water \naccess project in the state of Maharashtra.  \nUnder the Watershed Management Project, \nfresh-water streams have been enhanced \nusing the Doha technique, an environmentally \nfriendly process to store and harvest rainfall in \nman-made pits within an existing stream bed. The Doha technique enables greater collection \nand preservation of rainfall for recharging \nthe ground water table in dryer months. \nThis has benefited hundreds of households \nand supplied water to hundreds of acres of \nagricultural land. \nReducing Water Consumption at Stromag \nIn 2017, our Stromag facility in France \nparticipated in an initiative to highlight facility \nwater consumption. Each subsequent year has \nreported a decrease from the 2017 water \nconsumption rates. In 2021, Stromag \nrecorded an 18% decrease in water \nconsumption when measured against \nthe 2017 consumption rates.SUSTAINABILITY  \nIN MOTION   Examples of  \nour impactA stream in Maharashtra, India,  \nsupported by Portescap\u2019s contributions  \nto the Watershed Management Project.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AIMC_2021.pdf", "page": 20, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
