Yaw \nbrakes are central to the performance of wind \nturbines by enabling them to make directional \nadjustments that harness wind and generate \npower. Under certain circumstances, however, \nyaw brakes can produce excess brake dust \nparticles that can adversely impact brake \nperformance and reduce the lifecycle of brake \npads. In developing an innovative friction \nmaterial, Svendborg was able to greatly reduce \nthe amount of brake dust generated under \nregular operating conditions and create a safer \nand more sustainable solution for its customers \nand the communities they serve.\nSvendborg Service Tools  \nPreserving Wind Applications\nThe Svendborg team has also developed a \nproprietary suite of service tools that reduce \ncost, increase productivity and enhance \nefficiency of product maintenance. The \nSvendborg Piston Extractor, Lifting Tool, and Groove Tool help our customers extend and \npreserve the life of their onshore and offshore \nwind turbines.\nKollmorgen NDC Solutions  \nExtending the Life & Efficiency of AGVs \nKollmorgen has developed a platform for \nAutomated Guide Vehicles (\u201cAGVs\u201d) and \nmobile robots that utilizes hardware and \nsoftware-controlled navigation to boost \nAGV performance and efficiency.\nKollmorgen\u2019s NDC solution benefits \ncustomers by:\n\u2022   Optimizing vehicle routing within a \nmanufacturing facility or warehouse through \nadvanced algorithms\u2014leading to reduced \ndriving distance, lower energy consumption \nand longer vehicle life;\n\u2022   Enhancing the smooth start, stop and driving \nfunctions through vehicle control software\u2014\nleading to less wear and tear on the AGVs \nand robots; and,\n\u2022   Enabling automated testing leading to high-\nquality products and longer life of AGVs in all \nsegments and applications.PRODUCT COMPLIANCE & PRODUCT END OF LIFE\nWe are dedicated to \nfinding solutions to \ncomplex problems. \nMany of these complex problems involve \nextending product lifecycles for our customers, \nimproving energy efficiency of products, \neliminating potentially harmful substances from \nproducts and ensuring product compliance.SUSTAINABILITY  \nIN MOTION   Examples of  \nour impact\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AIMC_2021.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
