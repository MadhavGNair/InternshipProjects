{"page_content": "Altra 2021 Sustainability Report  /   SUSTAINABILITY    /  11\nEnsuring that we understand and \nprioritize the ESG topics that matter \nmost to our stakeholders and our \nbusiness was a top priority. With \nthat in mind, in 2021 we engaged \na neutral, third-party consultant \nto help us complete our first \nMateriality Assessment.\nOur goal was to identify the ESG topics that \nhave the greatest potential to impact the \nsustainability of Altra and to understand their \nsignificance to both internal and external \nstakeholders. Reference to \u201cSustainability\u201d \nwithin this report is reflective of the ESG topics \nthat intersect with our strategy as informed by \nthe results of our Materiality Assessment.\nThe primary output of our Materiality \nAssessment is a ranking of material ESG topics \nwhich will serve as a key foundation to help \nAltra understand how ESG issues impact our \nbusiness. This preparation is critical to identify \nareas of focus going forward. Altra\u2019s consultant \nhelped to shepherd the process to ensure \nobjectivity, transparency, and accuracy.Assessing ESG Topics\nWith the guidance of an external expert, Altra \nworked to identify a list of 26+ material topics \nwhich were further narrowed to 15 key topics for \ninclusion in the assessment. This initial narrowing \nwas informed by external benchmarking and \ntopic materiality for others within Altra\u2019s industry.\nEngagement with Stakeholders\nNext, Altra worked to identify its critical \nstakeholders to provide input to the Materiality \nAssessment. For internal stakeholders, Altra \nconducted outreach to associates across \nthe organization, hailing from different \ngeographic regions and with varying roles \nand responsibilities. External stakeholders \nwere selected from a carefully curated and \nrepresentative group of customers, suppliers, \nindustry advocates and investors.\nPrioritizing of Issues\nAltra completed a combination of surveys \nand interviews across this diverse group of \ninternal and external stakeholders. Stakeholder \nfeedback provided useful data points to \ninform the results and enable Altra to rank \nand prioritize the 15 ESG topics assessed.MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT & OVERVIEW\nThe results of Altra\u2019s materiality assessment \nare represented in relation to their respective \npotential impact on Altra\u2019s business and the \nlevel of stakeholder concern. Consistent with a \ntraditional materiality assessment scattergram, \nthe topics in the upper right quadrant \nrepresent the issues of greatest concern to our stakeholders and with the most potential \nimpact to our business and therefore are most \nmaterial. The topics in the lower left quadrant \nmay be considered material but are of less \nconcern to our stakeholders and represent less \npotential impact to our business.Materiality Matrix\n\u2022 Labor PracticesVERY\nHIGH\nBUSINESS IMPACT\u2022 Data SecuritySTAKEHOLDER CONCERN (Weighted)e\nMODERATEEmployee Health & Safety \u2022Diversity, Equity & Inclusion \u2022\u2022 Supply Chain Management\n\u2022 GHG Emissions & \n   Energy Management\nHIGH\nCommunity Relations / Engagement \u2022\nProduct Quality & Safety \u2022\nManagement of the Legal \u2022\n& Regulatory Environment  \nProduct Compliance \u2022\nConflict Materials \u2022\u2022 Water & Wastewater\u2022 Product End-of-LifeBusiness Ethics & Integrity \u2022", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AIMC_2021.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
