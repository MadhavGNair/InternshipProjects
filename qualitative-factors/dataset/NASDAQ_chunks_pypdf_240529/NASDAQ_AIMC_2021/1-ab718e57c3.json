With the Altra Business \nSystem as our guide, we live by our \nCore Values\u2014Teamwork, Innovation, \nLeadership, Continuous Improvement \nand Value\u2014to solve our customers\u2019  \nmost challenging problems, eliminate \nwaste, drive efficiencies, deliver \nexceptional value and seize the growth \nopportunities in front of us.\nAs a premier industrial company, maintaining \nsustainable business practices is a responsibility \nwe take very seriously. We believe this \ncommitment is essential for ensuring the long-\nterm success of our business as well as the \nbest interest of our team members, customers, \nshareholders and the communities we serve.\nI am proud to share Altra\u2019s first sustainability \nreport, where we provide visibility into our \nsustainability strategy, the impact we have  \nhad across key Environmental, Social  \nand Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives and  \nour commitments going forward. We chose the \u201cSustainability in Motion\u201d \ntheme for this report with great intention. \nFirst, although this is our inaugural report, \nsustainability has long been in motion at Altra. \nSecond, sustainability is not a siloed initiative; \nit is embedded in our strategy and integrated \ninto every action we take. And finally, because \nsustainability is a journey, we are dedicated \nto continuously improving our ESG practices, \npolicies and programs to deliver an increasingly \npositive result for all of our stakeholders in the \nyears ahead. \nOn that note, in 2021 we made great strides in \nestablishing more scalable approaches to our \nESG practices, reporting and systems to better \nalign our ESG strategy and focus efforts in the \nyears ahead. This included establishing an \nESG Task Force and completing our first ESG \nMateriality Assessment, where we validated the \nESG issues most material to our business and \nIn 2021 we made great strides in establishing \nmore scalable approaches to our ESG practices.Carl Christenson\nChairman and  \nChief Executive  \nOfficer\nwe are and how we do business. \nWe look forward to keeping you \nupdated as we move ahead on \nour ESG journey.  \nSincerely, of greatest importance to our stakeholders. \nImportantly, this exercise confirmed that we  \ncan have the greatest impact by continuing \nto use our Core Values and the Altra Business \nSystem as the North Star of our ESG efforts. \nThe Materiality Assessment allowed us to \narticulate our ESG priorities in four newly \nformulated Sustainability Pillars: 1) Delivering \nSolutions through Innovation, 2) Protecting  \nthe Environment, 3) Reaching our Full Potential \nthrough Teamwork, and 4) Operating with \nIntegrity.
