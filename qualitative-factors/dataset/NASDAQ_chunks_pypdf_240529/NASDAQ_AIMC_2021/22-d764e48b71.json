{"page_content": "Altra 2021 Sustainability Report  /   ENVIRONMENT    /  22Waste Reduction\nAll of Altra\u2019s facilities maintain waste  \nmanagement and recycling programs \nthat utilize ABS tools to systematically \nreduce waste. \nKollmorgen  recycles cardboard, paper, \nwooden pallets, used oils, cleaning solvents, \nbatteries and a host of other materials that are \nused in their production environments every \nday. Our North American Kollmorgen facilities \nrecycled over 427 tons (902,786 pounds) of \nmaterial during 2019 and 2020.Altra India  in Pune maintains a composting \nprogram that converts organic materials \ncollected as part of landscaping and \nmaintenance into fertilizer and compost.\nTwiflex  engages a third-party waste handling \ncompany to ensure waste is appropriately \nsegregated and recycled. To the extent \npossible, general waste is processed as \neither Refuse Derived Fuel (\u201cRDF\u201d) or Solid \nRecovered Fuel (\u201cSRF\u201d) and used to generate \nEnergy from Waste (\u201cEfW\u201d). Wood waste is \nrecycled and the remainder is used for Biomass. \nThese efforts have enabled Twiflex to achieve \nLevel 1 Green Mark Certification.\nBoston Gear in Charlotte, NC implements a \nwaste separation initiative which has resulted \nin a running average of nearly 10% reduction \nof general waste, and an approximately \n10% increase in recycled waste materials in \nrecent periods.In May of 2021 TB Wood\u2019s , located in \nChambersburg, Pennsylvania, initiated a project \nthat focused on plastic consumption reduction \nand reuse. Leveraging ABS tools, TB Wood\u2019s \nheld a Kaizen event to engineer the need \nfor certain additional plastic products out of \nthe manufacturing process. TB Wood\u2019s has \nreplaced non-reusable plastic hoppers with \nnylon sacks that are delivered with foundry \ngoods and which would otherwise go to waste. \nAfter determining that the need for these \nre-purposed nylon sacks exceeded what was \nreceived in connection with the foundry goods, \nTB Wood\u2019s coordinated with local suppliers to \ncollect and receive their excess nylon sacks. \nSince achieving full implementation of the \nproject, TB Wood\u2019s has eliminated the need for \nthese additional plastics, thereby substantially \nreducing waste and achieving thousands of \ndollars in annualized savings.\n427\nTons of material recycled \nby North American  \nKollmorgen facilitiesSUSTAINABILITY  \nIN MOTION   Examples of  \nour impact\nTB Wood\u2019s has replaced non-reusable plastic \nhoppers with nylon sacks.
