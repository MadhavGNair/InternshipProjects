Our environmental \nsustainability efforts include proactively taking action to \nreduce GHG emissions arising from our operations. \nThe increased activity at our facilities related to COVID-19 \nprotective measures, together with our opening of a new \nR&D and office facility in Waltham, Massachusetts, caused \nour 2020 overall energy usage to increase as compared to \n2019; however, our 2020 scope 1 GHG emissions declined \nby 6% as compared to 2019, and our 2020 combined scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions per floor area (CO2 per m2 \nspace) decreased 16% as compared to 2019 and were 29% \nlower than our 2015 baseline measurement year. These \nchanges resulted from our energy efficiency initiatives and our \nprocurement of electricity from 100% renewable sources at \nour Athlone, Ireland facility. \nIn addition to our focus on energy efficiency in our facility \noperations, we also encourage employees to use more \nsustainable forms of transportation when commuting to \nwork, including by providing employees with shuttle bus \nservice between our Waltham, Massachusetts site and public \ntransportation locations and installing charging stations for \nelectric vehicles at our Athlone, Ireland facility.\n2020 Carbon Performance Data \n*", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALKS_2021.pdf", "page": 16, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
