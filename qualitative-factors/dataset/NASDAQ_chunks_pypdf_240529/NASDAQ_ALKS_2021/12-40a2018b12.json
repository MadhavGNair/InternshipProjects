{"page_content": " 13Product Stewardship and \nEnvironmental Impact\nAlkermes is committed to the safe and sustainable research, \ndevelopment, manufacturing, and commercialization of \nmedicines. We implement this commitment by integrating \nEHSS risk management requirements throughout the lifecycle \nof each of our products. Our approach to product stewardship \noversight and control includes:\n\u2022 Generation of occupational and environmental toxicology  \n data, which is iterated and augmented as each product  \n progresses through its lifecycle;\n\u2022 Development and application of appropriate occupational  \n health, safety and environmental risk controls for each  \n product based on scale, potency, task and other  \n processing considerations; \n\u2022 Protocols and risk assessments to support safe and  \n responsible technology transfers within Alkermes or to  \n external contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs),  \n contract research organizations (CROs) or other  \n third parties;\n\u2022 Development of \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d processes to eliminate  \n or reduce the use or generation of hazardous substances  \n in the design and manufacture of our products; and \n\u2022 Implementation of a global program for process hazard  \n management with embedded controls as early as the  \n product discovery stage and through full commercial-scale  \n manufacturing of a product.\nExternal Operations  \nRisk Management \nWe have integrated certain EHSS risk management procedures \nand our formal RMS framework into our vendor management \nand governance processes. EHSS considerations and metrics \nare monitored and discussed as part of routine business review \nmeetings with our external operations partners. This approach \nenables transparent collective conversations about EHSS \nrisk and performance and provides a forum for Alkermes to \ncommunicate our expectations for responsible development \nand manufacture to our vendors.\nTo assess whether our vendors operate to Alkermes\u2019 standards \nand encourage adherence to such standards, EHSS risk \nconsiderations and metrics are embedded into our vendor due \ndiligence assessments, on-boarding procedures, technology \ntransfers and routine business reviews. We also incorporate \nEHSS-related provisions, as appropriate, into our service-level \nagreements related to our products.\nOur vendor assessment tools, which we developed based on \nthe Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative\u2019s \u2018Pharmaceutical 1\nALKERMES \u2022  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT \u2022 ENVIRONMENTFocus on Employee \nWell-Being\nKeepWell Mark\u2122\nIn 2020, employee health, safety and wellness were of \nparticular focus and importance for the Company.
