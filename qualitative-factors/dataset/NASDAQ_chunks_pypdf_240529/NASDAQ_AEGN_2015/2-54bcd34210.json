{"page_content": "Compliance with Global Reporting Initiative \nG4 standards\nWe\u2019ve been using GRI reporting standards \nsince we published our first corporate \nresponsibility report in 2003. For our Review \nthis year, we continue to follow the GRI\u2019s \nlatest G4 standards. These standards put \ngreater emphasis on \u201cmateriality\u201d \u2013 in other \nwords, reporting primarily on those issues \nthat most affect a company\u2019s business and \nstakeholders. This is very much in line with \nour own approach to reporting. For more \ninformation about the GRI and the \nG4 reporting guidelines, please refer to the \nGRI\u2019s website at globalreporting.org . \nThe G4 guidelines comprise three main parts:\n\u2022  Reporting principles  (how companies \nshould define the content and quality \nof\u00a0their report).\u2022  General standard disclosures  (which \napply to all companies regardless of their \nsector or the nature of their business).\n\u2022  Specific standard disclosures  (which \nrequire companies to select material \naspects  \u2013 those areas or topics they \nbelieve are most relevant for their \nbusinesses. For each aspect chosen, \ncompanies must report on their \nmanagement approach,  as well as \non\u00a0specific indicators). \nCompanies applying the G4 guidelines are \nsaid to be in accordance with the standards; \nthey have a choice between core and \ncomprehensive compliance, depending \non\u00a0the extent of their reporting. \nAegon\u2019s\u00a02015 Review has once again \nbeen\u00a0prepared in accordance with the \ncomprehensive option. This year we decided to take the outcome of \nour materiality process one step further. \nWith the G4 comprehensive approach we are \nrequired to report on all indicators as part of \nthe material aspect however, we feel that \nsome of these indicators are just not \nmaterial enough for us to measure or report \non, so in these cases we do not report on a \nspecific indicator assigned to that material \naspect. However, we have also introduced \nour own indicators which we feel are \nmaterial and relevant for our business, and \nas an alternative to the indicators in these \nmaterial aspects on which we do not report \n(these can be identified in the table \nbeginning on page\u00a010 with the prefix AEG).Switching to G4\nSwitching to G4\n3\nReporting Supplement 2015", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AEGN_2015.pdf", "page": 2, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
