For \ninstance, one such committee created a comprehensive safety video \nfeaturing our employees, \nmaking the pursuit of safety \nmore engaging \nand accessible  .\nEach EHS committee is \nsupervised by site leadership \nteams that review safety \nmetrics, incidents, and EHS \ncommittee performance on \nat least a quarterly basis  .  \nAt Allogene, we conduct \nmonthly safety inspections of all our buildings and strive to close out all \ncorrective actions on time  . All safety incidents are posted to The CarT so \nevery Allogene employee is aware and can learn from these incidents  . COVID-19 Response \nAt the core of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic is our dedication \nto protecting the health and safety of our employees  . \nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic began, we quickly created a cross-\nfunctional internal Task Force, led by the head of EHS, to ensure timely \ncommunication and decision-making in response to COVID-19  . The Task \nForce regularly monitors COVID-19 regulations along with community \ntransmission data and continues to provide COVID-19 updates to our \nemployees  . The Task Force also hosts educational seminars to educate our \nteam about proper safety protocols, vaccinations, and variants  . \nWe have implemented a series of COVID-19 \nsafety protocols to prioritize the safety of \nemployees onsite  . These safety protocols \ninclude requiring health screens and \ntemperature checks upon entering \nand facial coverings in open \nareas  . We intend to continue \nto examine our protocols as \nthe pandemic and health \nguidance evolves  .\nSouth San Francisco EHS Committee", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ALLO_2022.pdf", "page": 14, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
