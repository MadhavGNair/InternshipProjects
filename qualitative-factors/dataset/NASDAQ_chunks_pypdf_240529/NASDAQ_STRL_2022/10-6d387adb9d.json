{"page_content": "STRLCO 2022 SUSTAINABILITY (ESG) REPORT    |    11ENVIRONMENTAL \nIn 2019, Sterling subsidiary Ralph L. Wadsworth \nConstruction, along with the Utah Division  \nof Wildlife Resources (DWR), completed the \nlargest wildlife overpass in the state of Utah. \nSpanning 320 by 50 feet, the bridge towers \nover all six lanes of Interstate 80 (I-80) so that \nlocal animals can migrate safely. RESPONSIBILITY MEETS SUSTAINABILITY \nThe Sterling Way has always been about taking \ncare of our people, communities, customers, and \ninvestors. Equally important is our commitment \nto the environment. With efforts that go beyond \napplicable regulations and policies, we strive to \nbuild a solid reputation as an industry leader in \nresponsible infrastructure services and solutions.\nAfter all, we recognize our projects affect \nfragile systems. Therefore, we make every effort \nto protect them to the best of our abilities. This \nincludes projects like the wildlife overpass in Utah \nand the special crossing created for the Yosemite \nToad in California that enables them to reach \nbreeding grounds critical for their survival.These endeavors not only protect the lives of \nhundreds of animals each year, but it also has \nbeen reported that wildlife crossings such as \nthe Parleys Summit Overpass in Utah reduce \nwildlife-vehicle collisions by as much as 97%. * \nEfforts to measure how the wildlife crossings \nare protecting wildlife, our people, and the \neconomy are underway, and annual updates  \nwill be included in our disclosures as \nthey become available. \nAdditionally, by mitigating our impact  \nto wetlands during construction, as well  \nas using and/or reusing reclaimed water, recycled materials, and jobsite aggregate,  \nwe not only build responsibly; we help build  \na better world. \nUnder-road crossings \nhelp ensure safe \nmigration for federally \nprotected toads and \nother small animals.\n*https://largelandscapes.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/WILDLIFE-CROSSING-SUCCESS-STORIES-IN-THE-WESTERN-STATES.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_STRL_2022.pdf", "page": 10, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
