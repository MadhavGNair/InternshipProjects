Studying this career and meeting wonderful \npeople along the way gave me the opportunity to develop \nmy leadership skills, trust myself more, acquire new skills, and \nrediscover all that I am capable of.\nMy college experience was not always easy, but not giving up \nallowed me to graduate from UVM and then go onto study a \nDouble Degree online, during the height of the pandemic. I \nfeel fortunate for the opportunities that my study has given \nme, and very proud of persevering along the way in order to \nachieve my goals.\u201d\n\u201cAt Laureate Mexico, we have voluntarily and publicly \ncommitted to socially responsible management and continuous \nimprovement as part of our organizational culture.
