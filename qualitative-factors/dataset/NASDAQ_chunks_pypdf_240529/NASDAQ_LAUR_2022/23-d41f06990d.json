{"page_content": "Education is pivotal in creating awareness about environmental issues and empowering individuals to \ntake action. In our universities in Mexico and Peru, students and faculty members are leading the way in \ncreating innovative solutions to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges. This section \nhighlights some of the most inspiring student and faculty-led projects that are making a real difference \nin the fight against pollution, promoting sustainable agriculture, and improving the quality of life for \nmarginalized communities. Each project demonstrates the potential for education to drive meaningful \nchange and create a more sustainable future.\nBionic Seahorse Combats Microplastic \nPollution\nA new bionic device called Sugon, inspired by the seahorse\u2019s \nbiomorphic characteristics, offers hope in the fight against \nmicroplastic pollution in the oceans. UPN Innovation and Product \nDesign researchers developed the solar and tidal energy-powered \nmachine that uses metallic mesh in its fins and tails to collect harmful \nmicroplastics that marine animals ingest. With the weight of plastic \nexpected to surpass  the weight of fish in the ocean by 2050, Sugon \nprovides a sustainable, innovative solution to protect marine life and \nprevent plastic from entering the food chain. A study by the Ellen \nMacArthur \nFoundation predicts that \nby 2050,  the weight of \nplastic in the oceans will \nexceed the weight of fish8\nInnovations for a Sustainable Future\nLAUREATE 2022 IMPACT REPORT\n19", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_LAUR_2022.pdf", "page": 23, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
