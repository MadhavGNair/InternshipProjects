Multiply 3.04 emissions per employee \nby 1,470 total Argo employees, and the result is \n4,468.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted by \nArgo each year in commuting alone.\nSince conducting the survey, the pandemic \nreduced Argo\u2019s footprint substantially, and that \nwill continue. Given the experience of remote \nworking during the pandemic, more than 40% \nof employees are choosing to work from home \npermanently. A further 50% have chosen to work \nin a hybrid model, reducing their commuting \nweek by half. By reducing the number of office \nlocations, Argo is continuing to lower its carbon \nfootprint and costs.SUSTAINABLE BUILDING PROGRAM\nWe recognize that buildings account for \nsignificant GHG emissions through the use of \nheating and lighting. With this in mind and our \ncommitment to reducing our GHG footprint, \nthe majority of buildings in our global portfolio \nthat we lease have been equipped with \nenvironmentally conscious and energy-saving \nfeatures, including digital technology for video \nconferencing in all meeting rooms.\nLondon \u2013 BREEAM Refurbishment and Fit \nOut (RFO) standard building with sustainable \nrefurbishments installed to minimize our \nenvironmental impact. There is also a cycle-to-work scheme with on-site storage. The office uses \na high-efficiency variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air \nconditioning system.\nU.S. \u2013 Half of the 14 office locations are LEED \ncertified, ENERGY STAR certified or pursuing an \nenergy certification. Features include services that \nuse green chemicals, hybrid parking stations, bike \nparking and LED lighting.\nWe are continually assessing how to improve and \ndo things better, including making sustainability \nperformance a due diligence factor in the \nselection and review of our leased real estate. The \noffices that we will continue to lease or own will be \ncontinually evaluated for improvements to be more \nsustainable, energy-efficient and meet employee \nneeds. This pledge is in line with our objective of \nsupporting UN Sustainable Development Goal 11: \nSustainable Cities and Communities.We want to protect the planet \nfor future generations. And we \nwant our employees and future \nemployees to be part of that. This \nyear gave us time to implement \nmore sustainability strategies to \nreduce our footprint, and we aim \nto continue this every year going \nforward. \n\u2014Ian Macartney,  Senior Vice President, \nHead of Business Services and Innovation\nEmissions shall be retroactively recalculated to reflect any changes that would \notherwise compromise the consistency and relevance of our reported GHG \nemissions information.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARGO_2021.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
