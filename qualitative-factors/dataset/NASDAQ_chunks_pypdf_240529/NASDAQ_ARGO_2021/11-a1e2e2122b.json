Membership is voluntary and open to \nall employees. Each of Argo\u2019s nine ERGs is \nsponsored and supported by senior managers \nwithin the company. \n\u2022 Gender Equality\n\u2022 Argo Pride (LGBTQIA+)\n\u2022 Faith/Ethnicity/Race/Multiculturalism\n\u2022 Early Career Professionals\n\u2022 Working Families\n\u2022 Argo Heroes (veterans)\n\u2022 Generational\n\u2022 Socioeconomic\n\u2022 Disability\nPHILANTHROPY AND COMMUNITY \nOUTREACH\nWhile Argo Group\u2019s contributions are primarily \nguided by our employees, we occasionally \nsupport larger, company-wide donations at the \ngroup level. As an active, responsible corporate \npartner, we are committed to working with \norganizations inside and outside the industry  on \ncritical initiatives such as D&I, scholarships, the \nenvironment and sustainability, the Insurance \nCareers Movement and catastrophe/disaster \nrelief.\nOur Team Argo volunteer program allows \nemployees to donate their time to non-profit \norganizations and participate each year in local fundraising events. Additionally, Argo\u2019s Volunteer \nTime Off policy provides each employee with \none day (eight hours) of paid time off each year \nto volunteer.\nArgo Group\u2019s Matching Gifts program benefits \nmore than 1,500 groups each year. When \nemployees contribute to a charitable, educational \nor cultural organization of their choice, Argo \nmatches 100% of their donations (up to $5,000 \nper employee per year). \nOur philanthropic contributions are guided by \nthe same entrepreneurial spirit and targeted, \nspecialized focus that thrives among our teams. \nEmployee-led Community Relations Committees \nhave a voice in what Argo supports while \npromoting giving back across the enterprise. \nCommittees are established in New York, San \nAntonio, Richmond, Bermuda, London and Brazil.\nEMPLOYEE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT\nIn partnership with global business leaders, Argo \nGroup provides innovative, creative experiences \nand tools curated to maximize employee \nengagement, connectedness and development \u2013 \nwhich naturally increases business performance \nand growth. \nOur award-winning SHINE ONboarding program  \nincludes three virtual, instructor-led training \nevents held during an employee\u2019s first six \nmonths to help them understand Argo Group\u2019s \nculture, business and approach to D&I. Since its \nimplementation, we have seen a 5.4% decrease \nin turnover among employees who participated  \nin the program.SOCIAL\nWe\u2019ve re-crafted our philanthropic \nactivities around what\u2019s important \nto our employees. It engages \nthem, and I think an engaged \nemployee is a more productive \nand happier employee. It\u2019s a win-\nwin. We still give money to the \ncommunity, but employees are the \nones who are driving the giving. \n\u2014Bill Wharton,  Head of \nArgo Insurance \u2013 Bermuda", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARGO_2021.pdf", "page": 11, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
