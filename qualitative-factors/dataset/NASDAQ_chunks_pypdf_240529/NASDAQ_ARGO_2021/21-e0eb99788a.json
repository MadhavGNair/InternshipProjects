{"page_content": "Argo Group 2021 ESG Report  |  22Argo Group responded to the events of 2020 as \na global corporate citizen  and also used the time \nto focus on getting back to basics \u2013 improving \nthe company\u2019s culture and infrastructure to \nmeet the needs of employees, partners and \nshareholders today and in the future.\n\u201cWe started with diversity and \nlooked at opportunities to broaden \nour talent base,\u201d says Chief \nUnderwriting Officer Tim Carter. \n\u201cWe made commitments to get \nour technology platform to a much \nbetter place. We empowered our employees to \ngive us ideas for where we can be different.\n\u201cIf you look back at our year, it wasn\u2019t like we \njust kept going and kept the lights on. We \nfundamentally changed the business.\u201d\nArgo is a specialty company writing the difficult \nthings, he said. Bringing our expertise into the \nsegments where we\u2019re needed helps us grow the \nbusiness and bring value to our shareholders.\u201cThe talent is what makes us who we are, and I \nsee tremendous success ahead,\u201d Carter said.\nTRANSFORMING THE ARGO EXPERIENCE\nAs our partners demand more options and \nchannels to do business, Argo is developing \nefficiency and productivity improvements, said \nToby Jackson, Head of Digital.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the customer \nand broker experience, wanting \nto empower them to leverage \nplatforms and capabilities,\u201d he said.\nBut rather than leading with a set of a technology \ntools, Jackson\u2019s team wants to first know the \nbusiness objective and then identify changes \nand support to help achieve those outcomes.\n\u201cDigital distribution is the epitome of Argo\u2019s \noperations philosophy \u2013 we don\u2019t want to simply \nautomate or codify bad processes; we want to \nstreamline and simplify all of our operations,\u201d \nJackson said.Similarly, Argo\u2019s claims team embraces workflows \nthat balance efficiency with effectiveness in order \nto quickly address customer needs, says U.S. \nChief Claims Officer Steve Laudermilch.\n\u201cOur operations strategy and culture reinforce the \nneed to be innovative in how we solve problems,\u201d \nLaudermilch said. \u201cThe best ideas \nseem to come from the people on \nthe front lines handling the claims \nand serving the customers. If we \nactively listen to them, value their \ndiverse perspectives and execute \non their ideas, it fosters an inclusive, can-do \nculture that improves results.\u201d\nThe pace of change in the world demands all \nbusinesses, including Argo, evaluate and improve \nhow they provide customer service, he said.\n\u201cOur thinking, our products and our services \nmust reflect the needs of customers, the diversity \nthat they bring to our environment, and how \nthey prefer to do business,\u201d Laudermilch said. \n\u201cAnything less limits our opportunity to excel.\u201d A YEAR TO REMEMBER", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARGO_2021.pdf", "page": 21, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
