They\u2019re all \nconnected. \n\u2014Silvana Nuzzo,  Vice President, \nTotal RewardsRISK MANAGEMENT\nIn 2020, we revisited Argo\u2019s risk management \nstrategy. The Board Risk & Capital Committee \ncommissioned an independent review of our \nframework. As a result, the Board approved and \nimplemented additional improvement plans.  \nArgo Group\u2019s Own Risk and Solvency \nAssessment (ORSA) process was applied \nthroughout 2020 to manage risk and capital and \nidentify and ensure we manage our exposures \nwithin our Board-approved risk appetites. Our \nframework is aligned to the international best \npractice standards, \u201cISO 31000:2018 Risk \nmanagement \u2013 Guidelines.\u201d Our strategic risk \nmanagement framework is built on three core \npillars:\n1. Strategic planning and execution risk \nmanagement  \u2013 integrated enterprise risk \nmanagement, planning and performance \nmanagement   \n2. Strategic risk landscape  \u2013 top-down \nassessments of key strategic and emerging \nthreats and opportunities led by Chief Risk & \nSustainability Officer\n3.

The purpose of \nthe RAF is to support a risk-aware culture by \nensuring that decisions involving risk taking \nare made consciously, in light of the agreed \nbusiness strategy and risk appetite. Clarity over \nthe amount of risk that can be taken ensures \naccountability for decision-making.\nRisk appetite defines the level and nature of risks \nthat the Board considers to be acceptable to \nexpose the organization to in order to achieve its \nstrategic objectives. It, therefore, defines Argo \nGroup\u2019s willingness to accept risk. In expressing \nthe organization\u2019s risk appetite, the Board has \ntaken into account Argo\u2019s risk-bearing capacity \nand its strategic objectives. \nAppetite is articulated using a number of risk \nmeasures, including:\n\u2022 Economic capital impact\n\u2022 Earnings volatility\n\u2022 Scenarios and stress tests outcomes\n\u2022 Credit rating retention\n\u2022 Reputation impact\nARGO GROUP \nINTERNATIONAL \nHOLDINGS LTD. \nBOARD COMMITTEES\nSee Committee \ndescriptions in Appendix .GOVERNANCE", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_ARGO_2021.pdf", "page": 19, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
