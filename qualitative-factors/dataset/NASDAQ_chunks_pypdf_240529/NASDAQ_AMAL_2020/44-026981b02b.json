{"page_content": "45\n2020 Corporate Social Responsibilty Report\nCorporate philanthropy has a unique \nrole to play in the field of Corporate \nSocial Responsibility. When done with \npurpose and aligned with a company\u2019s \nCSR goals, philanthropy can be a \npowerful complement to enhance \ncorporate impact. Conversely, when \nphilanthropy is deployed without a \nclear goal or as a means to combat \ncorporate controversy, the results can \nbe mixed. As the Executive Director  \nof the Amalgamated Foundation,  \nAnna Fink knows the importance \nof a clear strategy to maximize \nphilanthropic outcomes. \n\u201cThere is an opportunity to shift \ncorporate philanthropy from \nbeing a self-serving endeavor to defining what it means to be \na good corporate citizen in the \nworld. We throw around the term \ncorporate citizens when it\u2019s useful \nor convenient, but we don\u2019t always \ntake it seriously. There\u2019s a real \nopportunity to shift that.\u201d \nAs a relatively new organization, \nAnna has worked to build a strong \nbase for the Foundation to scale \nand stand out from other corporate \nphilanthropies. In particular, the \npartnerships she\u2019s developed have \nhelped drive tremendous growth \nin just a short time. Initiatives like \nthe Families and Workers Fund \nand the Advance Change Funds \nhave brought together partners and donors that not only raise \ncapital for important causes such \nas the COVID pandemic but also \ninform how to direct grants due \nto their individual expertise on \nissues and communities. This \napproach builds strong support \namong partners and amplifies \nphilanthropic outcomes through the \nfoundation\u2019s efficient and effective \ngrantmaking. In particular, because \nit is a public charity, the foundation \nis able to accept donations from a \ndiverse pool of donors and focus \ngrantmaking to ensure that the \norganizations receiving grants are \nable to use funds without significant \nobligations or constraints that might \nhinder action.  OUR TEAM IN ACTION\nANNA FINK\nExecutive Director, Amalgamated Foundation \n\u201cI feel proud to work for Amalgamated \nBank and the Foundation because of \nthe way that we create impact around \nour values. In 2020, we saw impact in \nthree ways. First, was the tremendous \ngrowth of the foundation as a partner \nfor giving. Second is our ability to be \noutspoken in addressing issues, like \nthrough our Hate Is Not Charitable \nCampaign. Last is the fact that we \nhaven\u2019t just grown both in terms of \ncontributions and grants but also our \nability to organize funds to address \nthe issues we faced in 2020. The \nfoundation was uniquely able to be \nreactive and responsive because of the \npartnerships we have and the causes \nwe support.\u201d \n\u201cThere is an opportunity to shift corporate philanthropy from being a self-serving \nendeavor to defining what it means to be a good corporate citizen in the world.\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 44, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
