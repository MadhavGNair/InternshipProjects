{"page_content": "35\n2020 Corporate Social Responsibilty Report\nOUR TEAM IN ACTION\nTANISA WILLIAMS\nSenior Vice President, Director of Human Resources \nAt Amalgamated Bank, a \ncommitment to responsibility \nmeans that better never stops\u2014 \nparticularly when it comes to living \nour values. One of the ways we do \nthis is by empowering employees to \ncontinually raise the bar, and that\u2019s \nwhere Tanisa shines. \nTanisa Williams is the bank\u2019s Director \nof Human Resources in addition to \nthe head of Diversity, Equity, and \nInclusion (DEI). Tanisa takes her dual \nresponsibilities very seriously and \nis working to fortify the corporate \nculture so that every employee at \nAmalgamated can be advocates \nfor social change and responsibility internally and externally in the world \nwe live and work in. \n\u201cWhen it comes to human capital \nand DEI, it\u2019s not just a one-person \nrole. It\u2019s about building bench \nstrength and making sure that \neveryone is managing human capital \nresponsibly and effectively within the \nmanagement team. Traditional HR \nroles are evolving quickly, so it\u2019s not \njust important to attract and retain \ntop talent. It\u2019s critical that we nurture \na sense of belonging and inclusion so \nthat everyone can bring their whole \nselves to work each and every day.\u201d \nTanisa has been thorough, direct, \nand expeditious in her approach to enhancing DEI throughout the bank. \nFormal conscious and unconscious \nbias trainings, employee resource \ngroups, analysis of talent acquisition \npatterns, partnerships with minority \nleadership groups, and new policy \nprotections like a gender transition \npolicy are just a few of the initiatives \nthat are now commonplace at \nAmalgamated Bank under Tanisa\u2019s \nleadership. But some of the most \nprofound changes that stand out to \nTanisa are those that are subtle or \nthat might be overlooked. \n\u201cIt takes a high degree of diligence \nand vigilance to make sure that \nhuman capital management is \naligned with company values. Part of this is being able to have honest \nconversations to address things that \nare not aligned with our values and \nto make the necessary changes. One \nexample that really stood out to me \nwas a policy I came across in an older \nversion of the employee handbook. \nThe dress code in that handbook \nprohibited employees from wearing \nhoop earrings. This was a small, \nseemingly innocuous requirement \nbut, upon further reflection, has \ndamaging impacts on personal and \ncultural expression. As a company \nthat places high value on inclusion \nand belonging, it was important that \nwe update our policies and remove \nany barriers to our goals.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we nurture a sense of belonging and inclusion so that everyone  \ncan bring their whole selves to work each and every day.\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 34, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
