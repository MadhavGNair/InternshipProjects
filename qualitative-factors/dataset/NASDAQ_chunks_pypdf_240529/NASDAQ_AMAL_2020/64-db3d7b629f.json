We joined an amicus brief before the ruling in support of universal access to \ncontraception and condemn this ruling, which will affect an estimated 126,000 women.\nAmalgamated Bank knows that providing contraception and other family-related benefits is good for business and helps create a more inclusive work \nenvironment. We joined the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Business for Birth Control coalition, because it is a critical part of our health \ncare benefit package and yet so many people struggle to obtain affordable contraception. Employers, like Amalgamated, need to provide access \nto reproductive health care as essential strategy for employee retention, diversity, equity and inclusion, and financial stability of their workforce. \nAccording to Rhia Ventures\u2019 landmark report, Hidden Value: The Business Case for Reproductive Health, 86% of women stated that controlling if and \nwhen to have children has been important to their careers. This is an overwhelming majority that requires the attention of business leaders as they \ncurrently asses the diversity, inclusion, and equity strategies of their companies.\nWe called on other corporate leaders to stand up in the absence of government leadership and offer a comprehensive package of reproductive \nhealth and family benefits to their employees. Such benefits build and maintain the inclusive and competitive workforce needed to succeed. \nThese benefits include:\n\u2022 Access to free contraception\n\u2022 Abortion coverage\nAMALGAMATED BANK CALLS ON CONGRESS TO ACT NOW TO INCREASE RESOURCES TO SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFITS \nAPRIL 2020\nAmalgamated Bank urged Congress to act swiftly to support the more than 30 million nonprofits and small businesses that were unable to access \nthe first round of Small Business Administration (SBA) Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loans. We called on Congress to act to provide the resources \ncritical to our economic fabric, including additional funding for health care workers and local municipalities working with next to no resources in the \nfight against COVID-19.\u2022 Gender transition care\n\u2022 Paid family leave", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 64, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
