Storing more carbon per hectare than any other \nforest type, California\u2019s ancient redwood forests are home to the \ntallest trees on Earth, rich wildlife, and stunning landscapes. However, \ndecades of aggressive timber harvesting has depleted this landscape \nand battered the local economy. Now, as a result of collaborative \nefforts among nonprofit, private and public entities, and community \nstakeholders, this project has established the first large nonprofit-\nowned working forest that will keep this remarkable forest standing for \nmany years to come, while protecting the habitat of several threatened \nspecies, including the coho salmon, the steelhead trout, and the \nnorthern spotted owl, creating jobs and annually storing nearly 77,000 \nmetric tons of carbon dioxide.NET-ZERO OPERATIONS: GHG OFFSETS", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 52, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
