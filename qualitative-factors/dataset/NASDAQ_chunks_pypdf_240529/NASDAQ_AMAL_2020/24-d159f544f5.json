{"page_content": "25\n2020 Corporate Social Responsibilty Report\nThe work that Amalgamated \ndoes is essential. COVID made \nthis abundantly clear as our staff \nmade the transition to a safe way \nof operating while continuing to \nfill customer needs during very \nchallenging times. One of our \nleaders who was instrumental in \nthis transition was Edgar Romney Jr. \nEdgar serves as the Bank\u2019s Northeast \nRegional director and has a long \nhistory at the Bank, holding several \nleadership positions across functions \nin his 14 years. In late April, Edgar was \nappointed to lead the Bank\u2019s internal \nCOVID response team through the \nReturn to the Office (RTO) Task \nForce. His first order of business \nwas to develop a system to engage \nwith employees to learn about their needs, develop appropriate response \nstrategies, and implement the \nresponse rapidly. \n\u201cPlanning our response, we knew it \nwas critical to have cross-sectional \nrepresentation. We wanted to engage \nindividuals that were representative \nof the organization and could readily \nconnect with others throughout the \nAmalgamated family so that we had \nas much information as possible \nbefore taking action. This was also \nan effective way to communicate \nwith employees and solicit input. \nPart of what I think it means to be a \nresponsible bank is to make sure that \neveryone\u2019s voice is heard.\u201d \nTo achieve this, Edgar held regular \nmeetings with Amalgamated Bank employees and insisted on active \nparticipation to get a diversity of \nperspectives. The feedback from \nthese meetings was critical to \ndeveloping strategies for the variable \nsituations facing different locations, \nfunctions, and employees.  \n\u201cThrough the taskforce engagement \nand talking to people in the \norganization, we were not only \nable to build a response that \naddressed problems we couldn\u2019t \nhave predicted otherwise, but it \ngave people confidence that we \nlooked at everything and that we \ncould be trusted to create the best \nstrategies for the company and for \nour employees.\u201d \n\u201cI feel that we were not only nimble in our response, but innovative as well. Through \nthis process, we\u2019ve proven that flexibility and work-life balance can be done without \ncompromising business success.\u201dOUR TEAM IN ACTION\nEDGAR ROMNEY\nSenior Vice President, Northeast Regional Director \nThe resulting multi-stage response \nincluded new ways for employees to \nwork effectively from home, return \nsafely to essential in-person work, \nand keep every employee abreast of \nchanging policies and procedures. \n\u201cI feel that we were not only nimble \nin our response, but innovative as \nwell. Through this process, we\u2019ve \nproven that flexibility and work-\nlife balance can be done without \ncompromising business success. \nAs we continue to enhance these \nways of working in a dynamic world, \nwe hope that we can continue to \ndrive innovation and provide more \nflexibility and balance\u2014both to our \nemployees and to our customers.\u201d     \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 24, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
