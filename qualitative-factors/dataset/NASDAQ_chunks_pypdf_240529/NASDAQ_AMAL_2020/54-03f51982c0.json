Unlike other forms of carbon \naccounting, financial activities are often intangible, and it can be difficult to isolate precise outcomes that \ncontribute to climate change. While other industries have standards to determine the climate impacts of \ntheir upstream and downstream activities, the financial sector hasn\u2019t had a formal standard for financed \nemissions\u2014until now.\n \nThe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is a coalition of values-based financial institutions, standard setting organizations, and \nleading climate groups that have worked over the last 6 years to apply best practices in carbon accounting to the financial industry. Culminating with \na global standard in November of 2020, the first edition of the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry gives precise \ninstructions for how financial institutions can quantify and report their emissions. With this methodology complete, there is now a pathway for financial \ninstitutions to quantify their full scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions; identify means to reduce their emissions; set goals; and ultimately align their \nbusiness with a livable future and net-zero emissions by no later than 2050, as identified by the UN IPCC and the Paris Climate Accord. \n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 54, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
