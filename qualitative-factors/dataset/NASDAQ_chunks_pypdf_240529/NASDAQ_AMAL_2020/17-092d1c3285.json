{"page_content": "18\n2020 Corporate Social Responsibilty Report\nAligning values with value is easier \nsaid than done. As America\u2019s socially \nresponsible bank, we work to balance \nrisk, return, and impact for outcomes \nthat adhere to triple-bottom line \nprinciples: good for the economy, \nthe earth, and society. Bill Peterson, \nAmalgamated Bank\u2019s Senior Lending \nOfficer, has been leading this work \nfor several years now. In his role, Bill \nworks to develop partnerships and \nstrategies to grow the Bank\u2019s lending \nportfolio in alignment with the Bank\u2019s \nmission and values.   \n\u201cWhen we approach lending, we\u2019re \ncoming at it from two sides. First, \nwe need to be clear about what practices do not align with our \nvalues and excluding those from our \nlending portfolio. Our ESG Credit \nand Loan Standard has been clear \nabout what these practices are and \nhas allowed us to efficiently mitigate \nfinancial risks aligned with our values.  \nThe other piece of this is to be \nproactive in seeking lending clients \nwhose goals match our own. By \ncommunicating what we care about, \nAmalgamated has been successful at \nattracting customers who share our \nvision and demonstrating both impact \nand financial performance.\u201d \nPart of what makes Bill\u2019s job \nchallenging is the lack of precedent in this space, requiring new ways of \nassessing lending opportunities.  \n\u201cIn a normal commercial lending \napproach, businesses are evaluated \nbased on their credit and other \nfinancial indicators, but this system \nis only part of how we evaluate \nlending opportunities. Our goal \nis to determine if a company has \nsustainable benefits, so we need \nto get to know a business very well \nbefore we make a commitment. We \nmeet with prospective clients to learn \nabout their industry, understand what \nproducts or services they provide, \nand seek to determine what benefits \nthe loan can have on society beyond \n\u201cFinancial institutions need to recognize that they are part of the solution. It\u2019s not just \nabout financing\u2014it\u2019s also about supporting companies that align with your values.\u201dOUR TEAM IN ACTION\nBILL PETERSON\nSenior Lending Officer \nthe financial return. This engagement \nhelps us to live our values through our \nlending and to be a preferred lender \nfor impact-focused companies.\u201d  \nBill\u2019s determination is driven by the \nopportunity he sees in the banking \nsector and the position Amalgamated \nBank is in to bring about change.\n\u201cFinancial institutions need to \nrecognize that they are part of \nthe solution. It\u2019s not just about \nfinancing\u2014it\u2019s also about  \nsupporting companies that align \nwith your values.\u201d\n", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 17, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
