{"page_content": "69\n2020 Corporate Social Responsibilty Report\nAlthough our report title is \n\u201cResponsibility in Action,\u201d \nAmalgamated Bank also places \nimportance on responsibility of \nlanguage and words. One person \nwho exhibits strong command of \nresponsible action and language \nis Mandy Tenner. In her role as \nDeputy General Counsel, Mandy \nis responsible for much of the \ncompany\u2019s legal affairs, including \ncorporate governance, contracts, \nand securities filings like the \nbank\u2019s B-Corp\u00ae certification. \nAfter several years managing the \nbanks governance documents, \npolicies, contracts, and other legal \ndocuments, Mandy has been a key part of enhancing the company\u2019s \nlegal language to reflect its values.\n \n\u201cWords on the page matter. It\u2019s \ncertainly true for contracts and \npolicies because language is \nenforceable and has real power. Take \nfor example our gender-transition \npolicy. It may apply to a small \nproportion of our workforce, but it \nprovides real protections that are \nimportant to upholding our values. \nThis language is also a tool for \neducation. When people come across \nlanguage that is unfamiliar to them, \nthey have an opportunity to learn and \ngrow. That is one reason why I have \nappreciated having our pronouns \nin our signature blocks. It\u2019s simple language but it signals what matters \nto our organization and helps to spark \nconversation and education.\u201d \nAs a publicly traded Certified \nB-Corp\u00ae, Amalgamated has several \nlegal obligations to shareholders, \nemployees, communities, and other \nstakeholders, and it is Mandy\u2019s job \nto ensure that these obligations \nare met. Although this can be a \nchallenge, Mandy is passionate \nabout the intersection of law and \ncorporate responsibility and finds the \nresponsibility engaging and fulfilling.  \nIn addition, Mandy is an example of \nsomeone who is using her training \nto drive change beyond her roles OUR TEAM IN ACTION\nMANDY TENNER \nSenior Vice President, Deputy General Counsel \nand responsibilities. Mandy is \nheavily engaged in pro bono legal \ndefense work and actively seeks \nopportunities to take on cases \nwhenever feasible.   \n\u201cPeople here are so generous with \ntheir time and are supportive of your \npassions. For a legal team as small as \nours, it is unusual to have pro bono \nopportunities, but I am constantly \nencouraged and aided by my \ncolleagues to take on pro bono work. \nI have taken cases from Immigration \nEquality, Transgendered Legal \nDefense Fund, and other causes that \nare aligned with both my own values \nand the values of the bank.\u201d \n\u201cWords on the page matter. It\u2019s certainly true for contracts and policies because language \nis enforceable and has real power.\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 68, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
