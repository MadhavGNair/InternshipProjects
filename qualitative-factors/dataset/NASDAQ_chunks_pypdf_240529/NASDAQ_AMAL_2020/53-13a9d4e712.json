{"page_content": "54\n2020 Corporate Social Responsibilty Report\nAmalgamated has been an early \nleader in aligning banking principles \nwith outcomes for the environment, \nand climate in particular. But unlike \nother sectors, banking does not have \nsignificant emissions from direct \noperations like a manufacturing \ncompany or a utility company \nmight have. The greatest impact \nbanks have on climate change \nis actually through their lending \nportfolio and the ways lending is \nused by customers downstream in \nthe value chain. While this may be \nintuitive conceptually, practically \nspeaking it is challenging to quantify \nthese impacts\u2014especially when a \nstandard for reporting the climate \nimpacts of bank lending did  \nnot exist. That is where Ivan Frishberg has \nset Amalgamated apart on climate \nleadership. Ivan joined Amalgamated \nBank in 2016 as a First Vice President \nof Sustainability Banking after over \n25 years working in public interest \nadvocacy, organizing, and policy for \nenvironmental and climate issues. \nAs a leader on climate policy, Ivan \nhas worked to operationalize the \nbank\u2019s values on the environment \nand climate through lending, \nreporting, and partnerships. Since \njoining the bank, Ivan has had great \nsuccess expanding the positive \nenvironmental impacts of the bank\u2019s \nloan portfolio. However, recognizing \nthe need to quantify these impacts \nmore clearly, Ivan has taken on a new \nlevel of leadership to develop such  \na framework. The framework, called the \nPartnership for Carbon Accounting \nFinancials (PCAF), is the result of a \ncoalition of values-based banks with \nthe goal of developing a methodology \nto account for the climate impacts of \nloans. Ivan represents Amalgamated \nBank as a founding member of this \npartnership. Aligned with existing \ncarbon accounting standards, the \nframework provides clear guidelines \nfor banks to quantify and disclose the \nclimate impacts of their lending. As \nIvan shares, this is critical information \nfor banks to align their portfolios with \nclimate action and to finance a more \nlivable future.  \n\u201cWe believe there is tremendous \nopportunity and a moral calling OUR TEAM IN ACTION\nIVAN F RISHBERG  \nDirector of Impact Policy\nin aligning our portfolio with the \ndemands of sustainability. That work \nstarts with a transparent accounting \nof current impact and then setting \ngoals for the future. Our experience \nover the last year in working with our \nteam of clients to manage the COVID \ncrisis has been an even greater \nunderstanding of the importance of \ncollaborative work to confront issues \nlike like climate change and racial and \neconomic inequity.\u201d \nOur report this year includes \nAmalgamated Bank\u2019s first ever PCAF \ndisclosure for years 2019 and 2020, \nthe culmination of several years of \nIvan\u2019s leadership. \n\u201cWe believe there is tremendous opportunity and a moral calling in aligning our portfolio \nwith the demands of sustainability.\u201d", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_AMAL_2020.pdf", "page": 53, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
