This connection came through our Head of Human \nResources, who has volunteered with The Doe Fund\u2019s job placement and education teams for over ten years.\nNEW YORK STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT\nThe New York State Education Department\u2019s Adult Career and Continuing Education Services-Vocational \nRehabilitation (ACCES-VR) program assists individuals with disabilities with achieving and maintaining \nemployment and supporting independent living through training, education, rehabilitation and career develop -\nment.
