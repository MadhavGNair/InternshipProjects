Our executive, \nadministrative and operational staff ensures our business runs smoothly under all business  \nand market conditions. \nEvery year, we invest in our employees\u2019 personal and professional development and in their \noverall well-being. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2019,  MarketAxess made the decision to change its technology development and deployment \nmethodology to Agile development. Part of this process involves creating delivery teams who \nwork across technology functions and in tandem with business leaders. The teams are self-  \ndirected and empowered to determine what will be incorporated in the next release cycle. \nWe engaged with an outside consulting firm to assist us through this transformation, providing hours of training in \nthe principles of Agile development to all technologists and other interested employees in New York and London \nas well as support in the day-to-day processes. We believe this organizational structure and software development \nprocess will drive efficiencies and provide more opportunities for technologists to develop broader technical skills \nand have a voice in determining what work will be delivered. The elimination of the \u201ccommand and control\u201d model \nand movement to continuous 360 feedback from others on the team further empowers the technologists and \ncreates true coaching roles for those people interested in helping others achieve their full potential. \nAt MarketAxess, we are focusing on using Agile development to:\n\u2022 Innovate more effectively\n\u2022 Keep us centered on our customers\n\u2022 Help us to deliver value at speed\n\u2022 Reduce process complexity\n\u2022 Foster a culture where all contributions matter PEOPLE  \nBY THE  \nNUMBERS\u2022 298 employees in New York\n\u2022 33 employees in other U.S. offices\n\u2022 178 employees in London & other European offices\n\u2022 13 employees in Asia\n\u2022 4 employees in Brazilhas adopted a Vendor Risk Management and Procurement Policy that establishes MarketAxess\u2019 expectations \nwhen engaging with a third-party service provider, including requiring a criticality assessment and a review \nof regulatory and compliance status.
