The spotlight gives employees the opportunity to learn \nmore about the hobbies and interests of their peers. \nDID YOU KNOW? \nEmployees can access important benefits and other human resources-related items via the \u201cDid you know\u201d \nfeature on myMax, MarketAxess\u2019 intranet. \nTraining and Development \nInvesting in learning and development for our employees is crucial to our success and ability to make \nan impact. We offer a variety of courses and learning opportunities across many different topics to all \nemployees via online, on premises and off-site training as well as conferences. \nI value the firm\u2019s commitment to professional development. I was able to take a Python \nbootcamp this past fall that was challenging and fascinating as well. I had no prior \nexperience with coding and this program gave me a great foundation over a full day of \ninteractive seminars and lectures.\n \u2014 Chiqui Matthew, New York\nOver the last 18 months, we have developed a strategic leadership program for a select group of global senior \nmanagers. This curriculum focuses on tackling complex leadership and business issues and partnering on \nstrategic initiatives. We completed the first pilot group of 12 leaders in October 2019 and are starting a second \ncohort in the early part of 2020. Additionally, we have provided MarketAxess-specific training in leadership \nfundamentals to almost 70 managers globally. \nEmployee Engagement and Retention\nResearch by Mercer Sirota, a leading human capital consulting firm, shows that three core needs \u2014 achieving \nsomething meaningful, working collaboratively with others and being fairly and respectfully treated \u2014 create \nengagement.\nWe are proud that 94% of our employees participated in the employee engagement survey and we are \nactively working on further developing our culture and enhancing our programs in order to address the \nopportunities surfaced by our employees. Top findings revealed that the majority of employees are confident \nin the future of MarketAxess and that immediate managers create an environment in which their employees \ncan succeed. However, we don\u2019t want to become complacent. We will issue periodic pulse surveys so we can \nmonitor for updates and changes in sentiment from our employee population, which will allow us to continue \nto make necessary changes. In 2019, our unwanted attrition rates were in the single digits.\nI recently joined our newly formed ESG working group. MarketAxess is constantly trying \nto evolve and improve our culture, and stay at the forefront of industry trends. The ESG \nworking group was formed with employees from all regions and all departments to come \nup with an ESG strategy for the company. It\u2019s been a really exciting project where I\u2019ve had \nthe chance to step away from my day-to-day work and learn more about ESG in the finance \nindustry. It has also given me the opportunity to work with colleagues around the world \nthat I don\u2019t usually get to work with. I can\u2019t wait to see the results!\n \u2014 Tricia Chan, Hong Kong\nIn addition, we also host a number of ongoing internal initiatives for employees. \nRIVERSIDE CHAT\nEvery 4-6 weeks, a key leader or group of key leaders will speak to employees in a \u201cfireside chat\u201d fashion \nabout new initiatives, events, or other topics relevant to the company. Recent chats have taken place \nwith board members, Richard Prager and Nancy Altobello, about their experiences as leaders within their \nrespective firms, and with Mike Baker, chief technology officer at MarketAxess, about transitioning to Agile \ndevelopment software.\nLEADER LINK\nOn the MarketAxess intranet, managers will send through interesting articles on a range of topics, including \nESG, culture and technology trends. \nLEVEL UP\nLaunched in November 2019, Level Up is an internal campaign that serves to educate our global employee \nbase on the strategic priorities of MarketAxess, as a way of increasing transparency. Each feature includes a \nvideo interview with an internal leader who will speak about a new theme or key initiative. These features are \nactivated through various channels, including intranet, office signage and lunch and learn events.", "metadata": {"source": "NASDAQ_MKTX_2019.pdf", "page": 7, "parser": "pypdf", "split_method": "page", "run_time": "2024-05-29 08:35:04"}, "type": "Document"}
